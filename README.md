# Topic Modeling for Business - Ronak's Additional Notes 

In this repository, I have uploaded a file called ```Topic_Modelling_Notebook.ipynb```, which is a Jupyter notebook meant for use in *Google Colab*, which is accessible at the following [link](https://colab.research.google.com/). The idea is to upload this Python notebook to Google Colab so you can run/access the code. 

## Introduction

The point of the code/repository is to learn about topic modeling, which is an efficient unsupervised machine learning tool that helps in analyzing the latent themes from text datasets. In order to complete tasks in this notebook, we need to upload a dataset. In the coursera course, the [following dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10_X-Elz6aQR12E6YUh9qwYUxml7AZLTcr4Lv3WV7SEs/edit#gid=1891496005) was graciously provided. In the code, there will be a point where you will upload this file. 

My version of the file is called ```Topic_Modelling_Notebook_RonakVersion.ipynb``` and the one I've modified from Coursera is available in ```Topic_Modelling_Notebook_RonakVersion.ipynb```. Any data utilized is available in the folder that's called "Data."

In the ```Optimized``` folder, some modifications to the Topic Modeling were made - including implementing Grid Search to increase efficiency and cleanly listing out the topics for easy-to-see analysis. 

## Addendums to Original Repository

I've added a ```Data_STA``` folder with data that I used in the ```Semantic_Text_Similiarity_Exploration.ipynb``` notebook. This was an exploration in TF-IDF and Google's USE Encoder for doing various NLP tasks, mainly semantic search. 

Additionally, I've added code that enables me to do Topic Analysis and Semantic Analysis on Twitch live-stream chat. This will be called ```Twitch_Topic_Analysis.ipynb```.
