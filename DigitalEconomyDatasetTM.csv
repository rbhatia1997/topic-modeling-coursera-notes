"Nguyen Q.K., Dang Q.V.",Blockchain Technology - Opportunities for Emerging Economies,2018,"The recent major scientific conferences on the Innovatube Frontier (IFS) have focused on four areas of pioneering technologies, including Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, Blockchain and Augmented Reality / Virtual Reality. Blockchain has gained a lot of attention, because not only it is the technology that has created the fever of the Bitcoin and Ethereum digital coins, but also because of its great potentials that can change the nature of the real world and in everyone's lives. There have been various studies on blockchain, however, in reality the percentage of people who understand blockchain remain minute. This paper will highlight the important role of blockchain technology in the development of our future world, especially for developing countries. © 2018 IEEE.",blockchain; digitaltechnology; distributed diary; industrial revolution 40
"Melnyk M., Korcelli-Olejniczak E., Chorna N., Popadynets N.",Development of regional IT clusters in Ukraine: Institutional and investment dimensions,2018,"Introduction. Accelerated introduction of modern IC technologies in all areas of the country’s social life, development of the digital economy and the national information infrastructure, integration to the global information space and improvement of information security conditions are the strategic objectives of the development of information society in Ukraine. Furthermore, recent years are characterised by active creation of new network organisation forms and cluster cooperation in the IT sphere based on joint endeavours of IT companies, scientific and educational establishments, NGOs and other actors. Organisation of clusters in the IT sphere contributes to not only the optimisation of economic processes management in the course of creation, introduction and use of information technologies and products and services of IT companies, but also to forming of powerful integrated groupings with high economic capacity, which is essential for the development of the national economy. Purpose. The paper aims to analyse both the institutional and investment environment, in which regional IT-clusters develop, in particular the features, tendencies and priorities of their functioning to assess the role of venture capital in the development of the IT sector in Ukraine and to define the strategic directions to improve the instruments of public policy relevant to the development IT clusters in forming of an innovation ecosystem. Methods. Fundamental provisions and principles of innovative development theories and concepts of clustering, economic convergence and integration, diffusion of innovations and place-based innovation systems constitute the methodological basis of the research. Structural-functional and factor analyses are applied in order to reveal major tendencies and preconditions of the development IT sector in Ukraine and to evaluate the impact of venture capital on its establishment and activation. A Multi-factor regression analysis is conducted to perform econometric modeling of the impact of institutional features peculiar to the impact of the entrepreneurship activity environment on the development of the IT sector and forming of its investment capacity in Ukraine. The measures to improve the mechanism to assist the development of IT clusters in forming of an innovation ecosystem are suggested as a result of using the system approach. Results. The authors of the article have elaborated suggestions relating to the improvement of the public IT sector development policy in Ukraine. The intensity of the impact of venture capital on the establishment and development of the IT sector in Ukraine is assessed. The dynamics of exports of Ukrainian IT outsourcing products is researched. It shows that IT outsourcing is one of the most dynamic and leading directions of the IT sector in Ukraine. The evaluation of the impact of entrepreneurship activity and institutional environment on the development of the sphere of information technologies and forming of its investment capacity (the system of venture investment) is conducted on the basis of a correlation and regression analysis. Conclusions. The conducted research has revealed the major preconditions of the development of regional IT clusters in Ukraine. Overall conditions of the development of information and telecommunication technologies, as well as the ecosystem and infrastructure, are the most influential development factors of the Ukrainian IT sector. A high number of qualified IT specialists and a competitive level of their remuneration are the major preconditions for the dynamic growth of the IT sector in Ukrainian regions. The imperfect business environment of Ukraine is the key obstacle for conducting legitimate business, which deteriorates economic security in general and negatively impacts the quality of functioning of the innovation ecosystem, in particular in the IT sector. It includes a complicated tax system and a high level of shadow economy and corruption. Perspective opportunities to boost the development of the high value product segment of the IT sector and the internal IT market directly depend on the business climate and conditions of the country’s business environment, as well as on the level of the development of the national innovation ecosystem and its functioning efficiency. © Institute of Society Transformation, 2018",Country’s Innovation Ecosystem; Development of IT Clusters; Information Technology; IT Cluster; IT Sector; Public Policy of IT Clusters Development; Venture Investment

When the time comes to convert digital anything into cash they can bank, the same organizations, however, seem stuck in time. The purpose of the article is to highlight this inconsistency and, importantly, propose a solution. First, we leverage the literature on freemium and participative pricing mechanisms to lay the foundations for a revenue architecture fit for the digital economy. We argue in favor of three building blocks: empowerment, dialog, and reputation. Second, we describe FairPay as a promising configuration of these factors. © 2018, Macmillan Publishers Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",Digital goods; Electronic commerce; Price discrimination; Pricing; Revenue models
"Bertola P., Teunissen J.",Fashion 4.0. Innovating fashion industry through digital transformation,2018,"Purpose: The on-going transition of societies and economies toward different organizational paradigms deeply informed by digital technologies is at the very center of current debates, involving scholars and impacting on a broad context of disciplines, ranging from humanities to science and technology. Therefore, the so-called “Fourth Industrial Revolution” has been described as a model where new modes of production and consumption will dramatically transform all major industrial systems; it has been targeted by many governmental plans as a goal for a sustainable future. While general frameworks describing 4.0 paradigm are codified and accessible, implementation strategies and their implications on specific local and sectorial systems are largely unexplored. Starting from this assumption, this paper aims to provide insights on the current state of the art and major trends of the “Fourth Industrial Revolution”, possibly identifying its impacts on the textile and apparel industry. Design/methodology/approach: From a methodological standpoint, the study approaches the topic from the perspective of fashion domain experts which can contribute, with a positioning essay, to better understanding Industry 4.0 (I4.0) implementation within their specific domain. This experts’ perspective is enriched by several descriptive case studies (Yin, 1984) offering examples and insights on possible implementation of I4.0 solutions in fashion industry, also showing the potential of a design driven perspective. Findings: Starting from a synthesis of I4.0 framework and principles, the paper aims at showing their impacts on business units, processes and components within the specific context of the fashion industry. Through emerging evidences detected by experts’ domain perspective and exemplified by several descriptive cases, it offers a comprehensive overview of the potential implications of the Forth Industrial Revolution on this specific business. The picture drafted clearly shows how digital transformation, properly driven, could reshape the fashion industry into a more sustainable and truly customer-driven business. But, it also underlines criticalities and slowness of adoption by traditional established brands and companies. As a result, being focused on on-going phenomena, highly unexplored, it shows possible trajectories, enabling an effective transformation of textile and apparel industry embracing the I4.0 paradigm. Originality/value: The paper has a broad perspective and could offer insights to different audiences, which could effectively contribute to a positive transition, to scholars and academics, who might want to better address the implementation of I4.0 model into real economic and social context, focusing on medium – long-term implications and showing innovation pathways which are still unexplored, second to practitioners, who are usually immersed into strict silos of competences and business functions and can start to build new bridges and interconnection within the system, taking advantages of I4.0 potential, finally to policy-makers who can better shape development frameworks targeted to specific industries whose features require peculiar approaches and actions. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Design driven companies; Digital transformation; Fashion business models; Fashion design processes; Fashion innovation; Industry 4.0

"Watanabe C., Naveed K., Tou Y., Neittaanmäki P.",Measuring GDP in the digital economy: Increasing dependence on uncaptured GDP,2018,"As revealed by Tapscott in his best-seller The Digital Economy published in 1994, the Internet has dramatically changed the way of conducting business and our daily lives. Further advancement of digital innovation, including cloud, mobile services, and artificial intelligence, has augmented this change significantly and provided us with extraordinary services and welfare never anticipated before. However, contrary to such an accomplishment, productivity in industrialized countries now confronts an apparent decline raising the question of a possible productivity paradox in the digital economy. The limitations of gross domestic product (GDP) statistics in measuring the advancement of the digital economy have become an important subject. While this mismatch is an old problem rooted in the dynamics of product innovations, since mismatch brought about by information and communication technology (ICT) is very strong, finding a solution to this critical issue has become highly crucial in the digital economy. Based on an intensive review of preceding studies and empirical analyses of national, industrial and individual behaviors in the digital economy, this paper attempted to draw a perspective on this critical issue. By means of an analysis of co-evolution among a shift in people's preferences from economic functionality to supra-functionality beyond economic value, the advancement of ICT and paradigm change to uncaptured GDP, a solution to this critical issue was investigated. New insights for measuring the digital economy were explored which provide insight into integration of national accounts with product-oriented micro-analysis efforts. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Digital economy; Mismatch; people's preference shift; Productivity decline; Uncaptured GDP

The state of the digitalisation of business and industry varies between the European Union (EU) countries and regions. Each economy struggles to keep up with digitalisation in order to keep their productivity and achievement on a high level. Using the Composite I-distance Indicator (CIDI) methodology, we have created a multivariate indicator that can serve as a measurement of digital economy performances. Furthermore, we evaluate and rank 28 countries in EU (EU-28), based on their digital performances. We made an in-depth comparative analysis of countries in Europe, providing information about each economy with information on where they currently stand in terms of digital economy and what steps they need to undertake to improve and boost up their position in the domain of digitalisation. © 2018, UNIVRIJEKA.

Hanna N.,A role for the state in the digital age,2018,"Past and potential contributions of the state to innovation and the creation of the digital economy need to be understood now, more than ever. The state is under attack, and its role in innovation and technological transformation is being increasingly challenged and dismantled in many countries. This article takes an alternative view of state role in the digital age, one that is supported by historical evidence. The article examines the increasing demand for an entrepreneurial state and draws on lessons from pioneering countries. It shows the variety of roles and strategies that the state can play in creating the digital economy. These roles include nurturing a national digital transformation ecosystem and building an innovative and inclusive digital economy. These roles call for new state capabilities to fit with the demands of the digital age. This is a call for strategic learning and partnership, not for dirigisme and protectionism. The paper proposes an agenda for learning to master digital transformation and suggests that the appropriate role of the state must evolve in sync with a learning economy and society. © 2018, The Author(s).",Digital economy; Digital entrepreneurship; Digital innovation; Digital transformation; State role
Imamov M.M.,Digital threats in the transition of the russian economy to the innovative path of development,2018,"Modern information technologies are among the most effective channels for implementing the complex impact of the globalization process. Therefore, the issue of studying the security of innovative development of the national economy at the digital level is relevant. The aim of the research is to analyze the readiness of the Russian Federation to integrate into the digital space in all spheres of life, as well as to identify digital threats during the transition of the Russian economy to an innovative development path and to find solutions to prevent threats and risks of cybercrime. In the research process, the key was the analysis method, which allowed to achieve the purpose by deeply studying the outlined issue. The authors reviewed the program for introducing our country into the digital space ‘Digital Economy of Russia’, approved by the Government of the Russian Federation on July 28, 2017 and identified the advantages and disadvantages of this program. Furthermore, the authors give a detailed description of the concept of ‘cybercrime’ and its types, and determine how to deal with threats in the digital space. It was concluded that the implementation of measures aimed at creating an infrastructure for the innovative development of the economy and ensuring economic security for the implementation of priority national projects will create the necessary prerequisites for the implementation of national policy aimed at modernizing the country, Russian Federation gaining a leading position in the global economy, and restoration of world power status and ensuring sustainable development of the country in the socio-economic field. © 2018, by ASERS® Publishing.

"Ruggieri R., Savastano M., Scalingi A., Bala D., D’Ascenzo F.",The impact of Digital Platforms on Business Models: An empirical investigation on innovative start-ups,2018,"Digital platforms have the ability to connect people, organizations and resources with the aim of facilitating the core interactions between businesses and consumers as well as assuring a greater efficiency for the business management. New business concepts, such as innovative start-ups, are therefore created based on innovation, scalability and the relationships within the community around them. The purpose of this work is to deeply understand the evolution of business models brought by innovative and dynamic companies operating through online platforms. In order to achieve the objectives set, an exploratory multiple-case study was designed based on in-depth structured interviews. The aim was to conduct a mixed analysis, in order to rely both on qualitative and quantitative data. The structured interview protocol was therefore designed to collect and then analyse data concerning the company profile and managers’ perspectives on the phenomenon of interest. The interview protocol was submitted in advance and then face-to-face interviews were carried out with the following professional figures: Chief Executive Officer (CEO), General Manager, Chief Technology Officer (CTO), Marketing Manager and Developers. Collected data were analysed and processed through the Canvas Business Model in order to clearly outline similarities and differences among the sample. Results can be considered under two viewpoints. On the one hand, this work provides a detailed overview of the companies interviewed, according to the dimensions of: reference market dynamics, type and number of customers, scalability. On the other one, they allow to identify some success patterns regarding key activities, key resources, channel mix strategy, costs management, value proposition, customer segmentation, key partners and the way to obtain revenues. Results from the multiple-case study with 15 Italian start-ups provide interesting insights by comparing the innovative business models developed and highlighting key differences and similarities. Overall, the start-ups analyzed, operating in several sectors, showed great growth prospects and the possibility to create value for their customers through innovative products and services offered through digital platforms. © 2018, Sciendo.

"Nicolescu R., Huth M., Radanliev P., De Roure D.",Mapping the values of IoT,2018,"We investigate the emerging meanings of “value” associated with the Internet of Things. Given the current political economy, we argue that the multiple meanings of “value” cannot be reduced to a single domain or discipline, but rather they are invariably articulated at the juxtaposition of three domains: social, economic, and technical. We analyse each of these domains and present domain challenges and cross-domain implications – drawing from an interdisciplinary literature review and gap analysis across sources from academia, business, and governments. We propose a functional model that aggregates these findings into a value-driven logic of the emerging global political economy enabled by digital technology in general and IoT in particular. These conceptual contributions highlight the critical need for an interdisciplinary understanding of the meaning of “value”, so that IoT services and products will create and sustain such concurrent meanings during their entire lifecycle, from design to consumption and retirement or recycling. © 2018, Association for Information Technology Trust.","internet of things; political economy; social, economic, and technical values"

Today’s environment is highly dependent on technological capabilities. Tracking contemporary technological development is becoming crucial at both micro and macro level. One of the major revolutions in modern business is switching from traditional to digital business models for achieving higher competitiveness level. Digitalization is one of the primary impetus of today’s development. To accept and implement these changes, it is important to highlight the macromarketing role in this process. It is necessary to have concrete measures for identifying the shortcomings, good practices, and track the development. For this purpose, European Commission developed DESI to measure digital performance of European Union countries. This paper examines the DESI methodology and observes how the digital performance of EU affects main sustainable development components: economic, social, and environmental. Thus, the paper explores the correlations of DESI and other composite indices that measure sustainability components. Besides, the research examined the relationships between Hofstede’s cultural dimensions and digital performance.

"Cukier D., Kon F.",A maturity model for software startup ecosystems,2018,"Resulting from the digital revolution of the last decades, multiple startup hubs flourished across the globe in the past 10 years. Healthy environments for the development of innovative, nascent digital enterprises require a well-balanced variety of agents and supporting processes, which we collectively call a software startup ecosystem. These ecosystems are fundamental for the insertion of countries in the digital economy of the twenty-first century. However, having all the elements that compose such environments in the most advanced and prolific state is difficult and relatively rare. In this paper, we show that startup ecosystems can evolve over time passing through a sequence of maturity level stages. For that, we introduce a maturity model for software startup ecosystems based on systematic qualitative research around a multiple case study we conducted across three ecosystems. The study was carried out over 4 years and included an extensive array of data collection mechanisms such as literature reviews, expert interviews, and observations in three relevant ecosystems (Tel-Aviv, São Paulo, and New York); all collected data were analyzed with techniques based on Grounded Theory, resulting in a conceptual framework of software startup ecosystems. Finally, we developed a maturity model for startup ecosystems, which helps us understand their evolution and dynamics. Moreover, it can serve as a basis for stakeholders in less mature ecosystems to analyze their environment, identify weak spots, and propose policies and practical actions for improving their ecosystems over time. © 2018, The Author(s).",Entrepreneurship; Innovation; Maturity model; Qualitative methods; Software startups; Startup ecosystems
Hackl A.,Mobility equity in a globalized world: Reducing inequalities in the sustainable development agenda,2018,"Human mobility and inequality have determined one another throughout modern history, from the effects of labour migration to processes of urbanisation. The Sustainable Development Goals now offer an opportunity to re-examine this complex relationship in a globalized world. Drawing on major research evidence and key debates, this review article proposes a framework of mobility equity as part of SDG 10, which foresees the reduction of inequalities within and among countries by 2030. The main question addressed is how forms of social, human and digital mobility, including migration, can contribute to reduced inequalities and positive development outcomes. The reviewed research underpins the need for an approach that prioritizes equality of opportunity over equality of outcomes. Mobility equity offers such an approach and rests on two main foundations: people's equal capacity and freedom to be mobile in empowering ways, and the equal and inclusive regulation of mobility in all its forms, including human, social and digital mobility. The approach goes beyond income inequality and migrants’ remittances to incorporate the differential mobility capacities among people in different contexts. This includes categorically excluded groups such as refugees, racialized minorities, and lower castes, but also tens of millions of workers in the global digital economy. As part of a special issue on new SDG Perspectives, the article provides new ideas for thinking about research and policy-making within the wider inequality-mobility nexus of global development. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Equity; Globalisation; Inequality; Migration; Mobility; SDGs
"Leorke D., Wyatt D., McQuire S.",“More than just a library”: Public libraries in the 'smart city’,2018,"This paper argues that the transformation of the contemporary public library can be usefully understood by situating it within the context of the technology-driven urban vision of the 'smart city’. We explore this through a focus on a recent public library development in Australia where a high-profile new library features as a signature investment in the city's broader digital and 'smart city’ strategies. In analysing the library's entanglement with the digital visions of this city, our case study reveals the uneven and often contradictory impacts that characterize the digital economy. We argue that the articulation of a technology-led agenda with neoliberal governance settings has produced institutional tensions that go to the core of the library's role in public life, challenging us to consider how libraries might best serve a range of rapidly changing and competing needs and publics. We find that while libraries have been forced to make certain changes, they have also developed proactive responses to new technology. Efforts to reinvent themselves as ‘hubs’, ‘makerspaces’ and co-located community centres offering enriched spaces for social gathering, targeted learning, and new forms of creative production, including entrepreneurial activity and innovation, are strategies for maintaining and extending the traditional remit of the public library. However, these transformations are not adequately recognised within the structures through which libraries are evaluated and funded, thus making them vulnerable to future governmental agendas. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Community planning; Creative cities; Cultural infrastructure; Digitisation; Libraries; Smart cities

Based on the Industrial Upgrading Survey 2016, we use the matching estimators to estimate the effect of subsidies, granted in the framework of IUMP, on the adoption of three groups of ICT (Software, Hardware and Network communications). Our results show that although the IUMP has a positive impact on the intensity of ICT adoption, the level of adoption remained under that the transition to knowledge economy requires. We also find that investment incentive has reduced the digital gap between developed and backward regions in the adoption of Software and Network communications, by contrast to the case of Hardware, for which the gap has increased. © 2018, Economic Research Institute of Chung-Ang University.",Average treatment effect; Digital divide; ICT; Matching estimators; Regional disparity; Subsidies

The presence in the market space of firms that provide platform services for complex psychological diagnosis enables the manager to adequately assess the required behavioral competencies of the applicant, using as a standard the system of basic parameters corresponding to this position. The system of basic parameters is formed on the basis of the method of blitz-psychogram after passing by professional employees of this firm professional tests based on platform technologies. This allows the company to identify the character traits, motivation, preferred activities and role in the team with efficient employees with minimal own expenses. Applicants who meet the parameters of a psychographic portrait will be internally motivated for this type of activity.

Barnett J.M.,"The costs of free: Commoditization, bundling and concentration",2018,"Digital markets offer abundant free content but exhibit extreme concentration among content aggregation intermediaries. These characteristics are linked. Weak copyright environments select against stand-alone content-delivery structures and select for bundled aggregation structures in which free content for users promotes positively priced advertising and data-collection services for firms. Dominant intermediaries promote commoditization, and the reallocation of market rents from content producers to content aggregators, through litigation and free content distribution that weaken copyright protections. The potential net welfare effects raise concern. Network effects, compounded by weak inventory constraints, scale economies, and learning effects, promote winner-takes-all outcomes in the intermediary services market while weak copyright may generate output distortions in the content production market. © Millennium Economics Ltd 2018.",

When information goods are sold to consumers via a retailer, in certain situations, a moderate level of piracy seems to have a surprising positive impact on the profits of the manufacturer and the retailer while, at the same time, enhancing consumer welfare. Such a ""win-win-win"" situation is not only good for the supply chain, but is also beneficial for the overall economy. The economic rationale for this surprising result is rooted in how piracy interacts with double marginalization. We explain this rationale and develop useful insights for management and policy.

This has brought about a great transformation from a paper world to a digital world. Employees face new technological changes in their workplace almost every day. Some employees welcome the changes brought about by technology while others resist it and become defensive. These differences in employees’ reactions are influenced by a host of moderating variables existing in the environment. For the purpose of the present study, the researchers have adopted three moderating variables, namely, age, gender and experience (from the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology [UTUAT] model of Venkatesh, Morris, Davis, and Davis (2003, MIS Quarterly, 27, 3, 425–478).

"Harper D.A., Endres A.M.",From Quaker Oats to Virgin Brides: Brand capital as a complex adaptive system,2018,"We examine brand building from the perspective of complex adaptive systems. Brand building is a neglected engine of capital formation, innovation and institutional change in market economies. The nature of brands and the service streams they generate have been construed too narrowly. Brands are capital: entrepreneurs use brands as market-making devices that create value and capture profit, while consumers use brands to derive psychic income and lifestyle benefits. Brands are building blocks that can be combined in production to fill perceived gaps in brand architectures and capital structures. These structures are themselves complex adaptive systems. In an era of digital technological platforms, complex generative networks are the institutional locus of brand creation and brand extensions. Innovation in brand building is a socially distributed, service-intensive and interpretive process; it entails combinatorial experiments in resource integration by heterogeneous and socially connected actors, such as entrepreneur-producers, end-users and distributors. Legal brand owners never have total control over their brands - customer networks often exercise substantial de facto control rights (economic property rights) over the use and transformation of brands. Both the entire branding system (as a form of organization) and individual iconic brands can crystallize into relatively stable institutions that orient and coordinate market behaviour. © 2017 Millennium Economics Ltd.",
"Engle R., Zazzara C.","Systemic risk in the financial system: Capital shortfalls under brexit, the us elections and the italian referendum",2018,"Recent episodes of stress in the financial system have fostered a great deal of discussion regarding new supervisory and regulatory tools for financial institutions. The recent introduction of additional capital requirements for systemically important financial institutions is one example of the concrete measures that are being taken by regulators to mitigate systemic risk. In order to assist market participants in assessing and tracking systemic risk in the financial system, the Volatility Laboratory of the NYU Stern School of Business developed a quantitative indicator, called SRISK, which estimates the expected capital shortfall faced by a firm in a potential future financial crisis. Conceptually, SRISK is similar to the stress tests that are regularly applied to financial institutions; however, it is based exclusively on publicly available information (market and accounting data) and is quick and inexpensive to compute. Those firms with a high capital shortfall in a crisis – that is, when capital is low in the financial system – are the ones with the potential to extend the crisis and impact the broader economy. We use SRISK to quantify the estimated capital shortfalls of financial institutions under three relevant stress events that occurred in 2016: Brexit, the Trump election and the Italian referendum.We refer to these events collectively as BRUMPIT.

"Shevelova S., Plaskon S.",Is the Ukrainian economy’s absorptive capacity appropriate to attract foreign direct investment and facilitate economic growth?,2018,"Purpose: Despite an increasing volume of literature focussed on foreign direct investment (FDI) in transition economies, there has been little research into FDI in Ukraine. The relationship between the inflows of FDI (IFDI) and absorptive capacity (AC) has been under-researched in the peripheral transition countries like Ukraine. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the appropriateness of the Ukrainian economy’s AC to attract IFDI and facilitate economic growth with a particular focus on AC factors, such as the potential of human resources to absorb innovation and benefit from research and development (R&D) expenditure. Design/methodology/approach: This study presents a thoughtful research design: there is an analysis of the AC framework for justification and selection factors that allows a measurement of the potential of Ukraine’s AC to attract and exploit IFDI. The study uses data from 25 regions in Ukraine for the 1996–2015 period. To estimate the effects of IFDI on Ukrainian economic growth, a Cobb–Douglas production function is used. As an appropriate instrumentation technique for dynamic panel data, the Generalised Method of Moments is used to provide unbiased and efficient estimates of the results. The application of the interactive term in this study allows the authors to indicate the existence of complementarities between IFDI and human capital, in particular with higher education, that afford opportunity to absorb new technologies and benefit from IFDI. Findings: The resulting model indicates that R&D expenditure benefited very significantly in evolving country’s innovation system due to economic growth. Physical and human capital has not been used effectively in Ukraine to facilitate economic growth and attract IFDI. The number of patents is not significant in all of the regression models. Moreover, IFDI in Ukraine for the 1996–2015 period did not significantly impact on economic growth. However, the AC of human capital, in particular those with a higher education, is relatively relevant to benefit from IFDI. Practical implications: The findings have important implications for governmental policy, which should be based on improving the business climate, a strategy for digital development, innovation, migration, institutional and regional policies aimed at the achievement of country’s sustainable economic growth. The government should increase R&D expenditure as an important factor of gross domestic product growth and introduce grants, loans and other financial supports for encouraging students to continue university education. Originality/value: The originality and value of this paper is empirical and methodological. The empirical results of this study enable a conclusion about the appropriate level of the country’s absorptive capability required to benefit from IFDI. The paper also contributes to the existing academic debate and proves that despite the well-established theoretical framework for the IFDI–AC economic impact context, a new theorisation is needed to explore the full complexity of the country’s explicit relationship between AC and IFDI. Future research should be focussed on examining not only groups of countries but also distinctly the country’s explicit relationship between AC and IFDI with the particular attention for the under-researched countries: the peripheral transition economies to discover new research niches for theory building. This study presents an original methodological approach with a careful justification of the theoretical framework for hypothesis development, an appropriate sample and an original application of seminal research methods based on the Cobb–Douglas production function. This study proves that the interactive term, which allows indication of the existence of complementarities between IFDI and other variables, is appropriate for measuring AC in countries with smaller amounts of IFDI. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Economic growth; Foreign direct investment (FDI); Human capital; Innovation
"Apaydin M., Bayraktar E., Hossary M.",Achieving economic and social sustainability through hyperconnectivity: A cross-country comparison,2018,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to identify cross-country differences in socio-economic sustainability, which are operationalized as relative efficiency of economic and social impacts of hyperconnectivity (usage intensity of information and communication technologies (ICT) devices). The authors have a particular interest in the emerging economies because they enjoy outstanding growth rates and prospects for market expansion, and have undertaken significant economic reforms and, thus, should be expected to lead other two groups in the efficiency of transforming hyperconnectivity into sustainable growth. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to confirm the existence of a strong and significant relationship between hyperconnectivity drivers and socio-economic outcomes on a country level. The authors test the difference in efficiency of transforming hyperconnectivity into socio-economic sustainability among three groups of countries: advanced, emerging and developing nations using data envelopment analysis (DEA). Findings: The findings indicate that indeed emerging economies were the most effective ones to use infrastructure and digital content followed by developing and advanced countries, respectively. However, relatively better affordability of technologies in the emerging countries did not produce as much socio-economic impact as compared with developing nations. Favorable legislative conditions and high individual ICT usage in advanced economies did not contribute much to socio-economic sustainability either. Research limitations/implications: One of the limitations of this study stems from the classification of the countries. World Economy Forum and International Monetary Fund resources are utilized for the economy categories, but their basis for classification of counties is rather subjective. Lack of existing comparative efficiency studies on a country level prevents effective benchmarking of the results. Practical implications: Since the key vehicles of transforming technology into socio-economic impact are organizations, they should design and implement an appropriate organizational architecture which would facilitate this transformation in the emerging markets more effectively. Social implications: In a climate of increasing public accountability, governments have been increasingly urged to introduce good administrative practices and performance standards to enable efficient utilization of their resources and enhance social implications within and across countries. Originality/value: Although the impact of ICT on macro-economic development has been previously studied, the efficiency of this impact was not. Using CCA as a complementary tool for DEA approach in this study constitutes a methodological contribution to existing DEA research, mostly done in the area of operations management. Using DEA on a country level is a novel approach which contributes to the realm of application of this methodology. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",DEA; Economic and social sustainability; Emerging markets; Hyperconnectivity; Information and knowledge management; NRI

Design/methodology/approach: This is an exploratory empirical paper, which integrates the results of five rankings of the world’s most innovative companies. Findings: The five innovation rankings include a variety of companies based on different methods and strategic focus. This variety underscores the importance of a meta-ranking, whose multiple aggregation methods lead to consistent results. Only the following 11 companies are mentioned in at least three rankings, leading to a list of the 11 most innovative companies in the world: Amazon, Apple, Tencent, Google/Alphabet, Netflix, SpaceX, Tesla, Microsoft, IBM, Intel and General Electric. Overall, the meta-ranking is dominated by US companies from various industries with firms from China gaining importance. Originality/value: The paper contributes to research into innovation antecedents and consequences by illustrating the importance of innovation perceptions. The meta-ranking highlights the need for pursuing different types of innovation, following the innovation-based view on firm performance with first-order and second-order innovations. Moreover, the results deepen our understanding of digital transformation and of capturing value from innovation in the digital economy because a considerable portion of the leading innovators has a business model emphasizing artificial intelligence and digital platforms, which have led to the generation of new and to the disruption of established markets. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Digital transformation; Innovation ranking; Innovation-based view; Organizational transformation; Strategic renewal; Top innovators
"Yang D., Li M.",Evolutionary Approaches and the Construction of Technology-Driven Regulations,2018,"Innovation technologies have substantially changed commerce and society. A new financial industry in the form of financial technology (fintech) initiated the era of the digital economy. At the same time, inherent risks in technology-driven financial innovations, such as technical risks, information asymmetry, and even potential systemic risks, necessitate regulatory responses. However, insufficient regulatory techniques, outdated financial laws, and conservative regulatory concepts make it difficult for traditional regulations based on financial intermediaries to adapt to the current environment of decentralized financial transactions. Technology-driven regulations focused on data monitoring could be a remedy for the inefficiency and ineffectiveness of traditional financial regulations and enhance effective protection of financial consumers’ rights and interests. This new regulatory model aims to build a system that integrates equal access to information on blockchain transactions by both parties to it (i.e., the regulators and the financial institutions they regulate) for the purpose of oversight, intelligent real-time oversight, and an experimental sandbox for developing regulatory technology. This dynamic and flexible financial regulatory system could effectively address fintech risks. ©, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",fintech; regtech; technology-driven regulation

A management tool for Smart City,2018,"The article contains information and proposals on the development of the Digital Economy in Kazakhstan. An example of international experience in implementing the strategy of the Smart City is given. The solution of the problems is represented in the organization of a single platform, the collection and management of data on this platform. One of the tools for managing the Smart City is offered – Building information modeling - BIM. Building information modeling, abbreviated - BIM is the process, as a result of which the building information modeling is formed. Thus, at each stage of the information modeling process, we have an information model that reflects the amount of information about the building processed at that time. In this paper on the use of BIM technology, we consider tools and methodologies applicable in the realities of Kazakhstan. The use of BIM technology within the construct of the existing legislature of the Republic of Kazakhstan as well as the necessary standards that are required for the successful implementation in Kazakhstan are analyzed.

However, contrary to such accomplishments, productivity in industrialized countries is now experiences an apparent decline. This has raised the question of a possible productivity paradox in the digital economy. The limitation of GDP statistics in measuring the advancement of the digital economy has thus become an important subject. This paper analyzed the structural sources of this problem. Utilizing the results of empirical analyses of national, industrial, and individual behavior in the digital economy, solutions to these critical issues were investigated. Based on the two-faced nature of information and communication technology (ICT) and the fact that people's preferences extend beyond economic value, the concept of uncaptured GDP was postulated and spinoff dynamism to a new co-evolution among advancement of the Internet, increasing dependence on uncaptured GDP, and a shift in people's preferences was reviewed. This provided new insight and suggested a transformative direction to address the limitation of using GDP statistics in the digital economy. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Digital economy; Limitation of GDP; Productivity decline; Soft innovation resources; Uncaptured GDP

"Drasch B.J., Schweizer A., Urbach N.",Integrating the ‘Troublemakers’: A taxonomy for cooperation between banks and fintechs,2018,"The banking sector has been subject to fundamental changes as digitalization is enabling novel technology-driven banking services and is creating new customer demands. While banks face sluggish innovation processes, fintechs take advantage of the digital era, delivering customer-centric solutions. Although banks have realized that cooperation with fintechs is a key approach to foster innovation, they struggle to address the associated challenges. Yet, there has been very little research into this phenomenon, so as to establish best practices, because neither bank-fintech cooperation, nor associated and relevant characteristics have been evaluated. However, especially from an economic and financial perspective it is crucial to close this research gap to better understand how technology-driven organizations and cooperating with them reshapes the financial sector and therefore entire economies. Thus, we propose a theoretically founded and empirically proven taxonomy. Based on the literature, 136 real-world cases, and 12 expert interviews, our results suggest structuring and describing bank-fintech cooperation through 13 dimensions. Further, the empirical examination allows for the identification of prevailing cooperation patterns. Our findings contribute to theory development on fintechs, their integration into the banking sector, and the cross-organizational cooperation research area. This paper also has practical implications for both banks and fintechs, and opens promising avenues for future research. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Banking; Cooperation; Digital transformation; Fintechs; Taxonomy

The literature argues that ExS design should be a research priority in this experience economy, yet little is known on how to articulate ExSs in their design. This paper proposes a tool called Experience Design Board for visualizing an ExS delivery process as a basis for its analysis and design. The tool is a matrix-shaped board where the key factors of experience creation in ExS (namely, servicescape, frontstage employees, other customers, backstage employees, and technology support systems) are represented in rows, and the customer experience phases are placed in columns. The tool is useful in analyzing and designing how the key factors of ExS create customer experience. The tool integrates several work streams within the evolving ExS literature into its structure and is generic enough to accommodate various ExSs in physical and digital experience contexts. By visualizing an ExS delivery process from beginning to end, the designer can obtain a systematic understanding of the essential attributes of ExS and can use it for an effective design. This tool would serve as a basis for service design in this experience economy. © 2018 The Authors",Experience Design Board; Experience-centric service (ExS); Service blueprinting; Service design; Service visualization
"Boronos V., Plikus I., Aleksandrov V., Antoniuk N.",Digital transformation of Ukraine: Challenges of theory and practice in implementation of digital quality of life,2018,"Introduction. The complexity of predicting the digitalisation processes with regard to all existing challenges and potentials of digital transformation raises the relevance of both theoretical and empirical studies related to the indicators development that allow analysing the current level of digitalisation of the socio-economic development of the territory, the transformational potential, the digital quality of life and the creation of methods for its evaluation, as well as determining the perspective directions in the digitalisation policy. The purpose of the article is to develop methodological approaches to the evaluation of the digital quality of life. Methods. The methods of formalisation, hypothetical assumption, system approach and scientific abstraction were used in the study. The Pareto principle and the ABC analysis method were used while determining the transformational potential (the significance of the digital space components tendency). In the developing of the indicators for assessing the digital quality of life in terms of the digital space components the process approach and the EFQM excellence model were used. The basis for calculating each indicator is the method of linear scaling. Results. The paper proposes a conceptual model of the digital transformation in the economy and society which is represented both from the position of three digital spaces: business, education and science, state and society and from the viewpoint of process-industrial and technological approaches. In this model, the functions of business, education and science, the state and society are mutually complementary. It is suggested to monitor the development of individual components of the digital space in two directions: 1) the readiness of each component to digital transformations; 2) the use of information and communication technologies and their impact on the development of the specific component of the digital space and the quality of digital life. This approach to monitoring allows us to assess the digital quality of life. A methodology for assessing digital quality has been developed and indicators for its evaluation have been proposed. The assessment of the digital quality of life on average in the European Union (EU) and Ukraine by components of the territory's digital space for 2015 showed that the EU requires progress in the dissemination of digital public services (0.39) and the integration of digital technologies into business activities (0.48), Ukraine is far behind the EU in terms of the digital quality of life. Conclusions. In comparison with similar studies, the proposed methodology for assessing the digital quality of life allows us to identify problem areas and competitive advantages of digitalisation of the economy and society, and provides the ability to model the development the level of the digital quality of life in view of changing conditions. © Institute of Society Transformation, 2018.",Digital economy; Digital quality of life; Digital space; Indicators of digital quality of life; Transformation potential

In this research, we build a system dynamics model of a ride sharing platform in a developing country that endogenizes the growth of the platform in the presence of stickiness of the asset provider, since platform growth can occur only through new investments in assets that have limited utility outside the platform. Our modeling approach enables capture of two-sided positive network externalities and the same-side negative externalities together in the same framework.

"Lammers T., Tomidei L., Regattieri A.",What causes companies to transform digitally? An overview of drivers for Australian key industries,2018,"Business leaders and entrepreneurs are facing new challenges in the rapidly transforming digital economy. The benefits obtained by the employment of digital technologies are broadly acknowledged. However, decisions need to be made about which technologies to acquire and how to integrate them into the business. In order to do this efficiently, organizations and disruptors all over the world need to understand the key drivers of digital transformation that affect their operations and industries. In this paper, the outcomes of a systematic literature review are presented which identify the drivers for digital transformations across key industries-using the example of Australia and its five core industries of services, mining, manufacturing, agriculture and construction. Outcomes indicate that drivers for digital transformation vary significantly across different industries. However, some drivers such as 'environmental sustainability' were found to be important across most industries. The results contribute to current research in this field by providing a comprehensive overview of industry-specific transformation drivers.

"Pradhan A., Agwa-Ejon J.",Opportunities and challenges of embracing smart factory in South Africa,2018,"The fourth industrial revolution combines cyber-physical systems with manufacturing processes, enabling industries to automate and maintain their production in real time. Smart technologies open new global markets and increase global economy, however there are some challenges associated with the implementation such as lack of skilled manpower, social inequality, potential disruption in labor market, cyber-risks, etc. This paper investigates the opportunities and challenges associated with the adoption and implementation of smart factory in South Africa using extensive review of available literatures, which is verified using a single South African case study. It was observed that the current adoption of smart technologies is low. South African manufacturing industry and existing workforce will require upgrades to match skills required for smart factory. Smart factory may displace specific labor force with automation, however it will also create new types of jobs. Some industries are already using flexible production and producing customer-specific goods, which indicates that these industries will easily transform to mass customization. Cyber-risks and privacy issues of digital revolution provides a platform for existing ICT professionals to engage in RD, as well as create new jobs related to development of security systems and software.

Teece D.J.,"Profiting from innovation in the digital economy: Enabling technologies, standards, and licensing models in the wireless world",2018,"The value-capture problem for innovators in the digital economy involves some different challenges from those in the industrial economy. It inevitably requires understanding the dynamics of platforms and ecosystems. These challenges are amplified for enabling technologies, which are the central focus of this article. The innovator of an enabling technology has a special business model challenge because the applicability to many downstream verticals forecloses, as a practical matter, ownership of all the relevant complements. Complementary assets (vertical and lateral) in the digital context are no longer just potential value-capture mechanisms (through asset price appreciation or through preventing exposure to monopolistic bottleneck pricing by others); they may well be needed simply for the technology to function. Technological and innovational complementors present both coordination and market design challenges to the innovator that generally lead to market failure in the form of an excess of social over private returns. The low private return leads to socially sub-optimal underinvestment in future R&D that can be addressed to some extent by better strategic decision-making by the innovator and/or by far-sighted policies from government and the judiciary. The default value-capture mechanism for many enabling technologies is the licensing of trade secrets and/or patents. Licensing is shown to be a difficult business model to implement from a value-capture perspective. When injunctions for intellectual property infringement are hard to win, or even to be considered, the incentives for free riding by potential licensees are considerable. Licensing is further complicated if it involves standard essential patents, as both courts and policy makers may fail to understand that development of a standard involves components of both interoperability and technology development. If a technology standard is not treated as the embodiment of significant R&D efforts enabling substantial new downstream economic activity, then rewards are likely to be calibrated too low to support appropriate levels of future innovation. © 2018",Appropriability; Complementarity; General-purpose technology; Licensing; Platform; Standards; Technology policy

Bellace J.R.,Back to the future: workplace relations and labour law in the 21st century in the Asia Pacific context,2018,"Modern labour law is a product of the industrial revolution. In an earlier age, the rights and obligations of capital and labour were status based, such as master and servant, or landowner and farmworker. The move into factories led to the demise of status-based based obligations. In the initial stages, the wages-for-work performed transaction resulted in harsh working conditions and significant insecurity for most workers who lacked bargaining power. Labour law was developed, based on a notion of ‘employment’ resting on a contractual relationship between employer and employee with rights and obligations, shaped by statutory regulation. In the twenty-first century, this notion of employment that undergirds labour law has been breaking down as we move into the information age. Technological change led to a digital or gig economy where IT platforms using algorithms can replace managers and workers are no longer employees, where labour law often does not apply, and where full-time, stable employment is disappearing. The challenge is to devise a new labour law which focuses on the fundamental rights and needs of working people. How these changes will affect any specific country depends on its level of economic development, and its already established mechanisms for responding to disruptive changes. Advanced democratic countries may experience greater disruption and find it more difficult to form the consensus necessary to devise new policies and laws for supporting workers. © 2018 Australian HR Institute",Asia Pacific context; decent work; digital economy; informal employment; labour law; workplace relations

The focus is on the “design global, manufacture local” model. This model builds on the conjunction of the digital commons of knowledge and design with desktop and benchtop manufacturing technologies (from three-dimensional printers and laser cutters to low-tech tools and crafts). Two case studies are presented to illustrate three interlocked practices of this model for degrowth. It is argued that a “design global, manufacture local” model, as exemplified by these case studies, seems to arise in a significantly different political economy from that of the conventional industrial model of mass production. “Design global, manufacture local” may be seen as a platform to bridge digital and knowledge commons with existing physical infrastructures and degrowth communities, in order to achieve distributed modes of collaborative production. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Commons; Degrowth; Localization; Open hardware; Open source
Li L.,China's manufacturing locus in 2025: With a comparison of “Made-in-China 2025” and “Industry 4.0”,2018,"In this study, we have compared Germany's “Industry 4.0” and China's “Made-in-China 2025” and estimated China's locus in “Made-in-China 2025”. “Made-in-China 2025” has clear goals, measures and sector focus. Its guiding principles are to enhance industrial capability through innovation-driven manufacturing, optimize the structure of Chinese industry, emphasize quality over quantity, train and attract talent, and achieve green manufacturing and environment. Data show that currently China is no longer the lowest–cost labor market; it is being squeezed by newly emerging low-cost producers such as Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. Meanwhile, China is not the strongest player in the high-tech arena; well-established industrialized nations, the US, Germany, and Japan, have all effectively deployed digital technology to create new industrial environments, produce new products, and improve their well-established brands. Having analyzed the data from the World Bank and China's National Bureau of Statistics, we find an upward trajectory in China in manufacturing capability development, research and development commitment, and human capital investment. However, implementing an ambitious strategic plan such as “Made-in-China 2025” is coupled with challenges.

Howell S.T.,Joint ventures and technology adoption: A Chinese industrial policy that backfired,2018,"To spur technology transfer, emerging market policymakers often require foreign firms to form joint ventures (JVs) with domestic firms. Through knowledge spillovers, JVs may reduce technology acquisition costs for domestic firms. Yet domestic firm rents from JVs could discourage innovation through a cannibalization effect. Which force dominates is an empirical question. I address it with novel data on China's auto sector. In response to fuel economy standards requiring firms to upgrade technology or sacrifice quality, firms with JVs reduced quality and price relative to their counterparts. Consistent with cannibalization, firms with JVs drive the negative effect. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Foreign direct investment; Industrial policy; Joint ventures; Research and development; Technology diffusion

"Deng Z., Jean R.-J.B., Sinkovics R.R.",Rapid expansion of international new ventures across institutional distance,2018,"Rapid export expansion into institutionally distant locations has become more possible in the era of digital economy. Will such rapid expansion bring desirable outcome to firms? In a context of international new ventures (INVs) from emerging markets, we reconceptualize export expansion speed as the pace of exporting across institutional distance over a certain period of time. We then examine the relationship between rapid export expansion across institutional distance and overall firm performance. We incorporate directionality into export expansion and hypothesize the relationship to be positive when INVs export upwardly to more open countries, yet the relationship to be negative when INVs export downwardly to less open countries. We also hypothesize that the degree of market liberalization in subnational regions of origin of the INVs moderates the above speed–performance relationships. Instrumental variable models based on data of Chinese indigenous INVs during 2000–2009 support these hypotheses. This study both zooms in and zooms out the analytical lens along the location-related institutional axis, examines the joint effect of institutions involved in supranational directions and subnational origins on firm performance, and advances institutional theory. © 2017, The Author(s).",diseconomies of time compression; emerging markets; institutional distance; instrumental variable models; international new ventures (INVs); learning advantages of newness
"Papadopoulos S., Stavroulias P., Sager T., Baranoff E.",A three-state early warning system for the European Union,2018,"The global financial crisis of 2007–8 focused the attention of the financial authorities on improving forecasting methods in order to avoid future financial crises of similar magnitude. We contribute to the literature on crisis prediction in several important ways. First, we develop an early warning system (EWS) that provides between seven and twelve quarters’ advance warning with high accuracy in out-of-sample testing. Second, our EWS applies region-wide to the leading economies in the European Union. Third, the methodology is transparent, utilizing only publicly available macrolevel data and comparing standard statistical classification methodology (multinomial logistic regression, discriminant analysis and neural networks). Fourth, we employ two relatively novel methodological innovations in EWS modeling: three-state (ternary) classification to guarantee a minimumadvance warning period, and a fitting and evaluation criterion (the total harmonic mean) that prioritizes avoiding classification errors for the relatively infrequent events of most interest. As a consequence, a policy maker who uses these methods will enjoy a high probability that future crises could be signaled well in advance and that crisis warnings will not be false alarms. Finally, since we focus on EU15, we provide an overall response on where the most common macroeconomic indicators can be used uniformly for that region. © 2018 Infopro Digital Risk (IP) Limited.",Banking crisis; Classification methods; Financial stability; Goodness-of-fit measures; Macroprudential policy
"Katz J., Pietrobelli C.","Natural resource based growth, global value chains and domestic capabilities in the mining industry",2018,"Received theory of production is not very useful if we try to understand what the ‘sources’ of growth are when we deal with natural resource-based sectors of economic activity. In these industries, a complex set of interactions and co-evolution prevails between firms producing the commodity and leading the value chain, subcontractors supplying them with machinery, equipment, services and process engineering knowhow, public sector agencies monitoring their environmental impact and local communities engaged in the exploitation of the resource. These agents interact on a daily basis giving rise to a complex set of ‘sector specific’ rules of governance which vary from country to country and from sector to sector. In this paper we look at the mining industry, that has experienced a very rapid process of change due to the dramatic expansion of demand from China, India and other economies, and to major changes in the international knowledge frontier in many different scientific and technological disciplines (e.g. geology, biotechnologies, digital and computer sciences, health sciences and engineering). These developments have induced dramatic changes in the industry and most notably in the patterns of interaction among the various agents mentioned above. A similar process of sector-specific dynamic interdependencies seems to prevail in other natural resource based sectors, such as aquaculture, forestry products and others. In this paper we present a model of these interactions and sketch out an analytical view as to how production organization takes place in the mining sector, and how these location-specific forces induce change in the industry over time. Our way of looking at these issues has strong policy implications which we briefly examine in the final pages of the paper. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Global Value Chains; Governance; Innovation and learning; Local communities; Mining; Natural resources; O13; O32; O43; Regulatory agencies
Petrenko S.,Cyber security innovation for the digital economy: A case study of the Russian federation,2018,"considers possible solutions to the relatively new scientific-technical problem of developing innovative solutions in the field of cyber security for the Digital Economy. The solutions proposed are based on the results of exploratory studies conducted by the author in the areas of Big Data acquisition, cognitive information technologies (cogno-technologies), new methods of analytical verification of digital ecosystems on the basis of similarity invariants and dimensions, and ""computational cognitivism,"" involving a number of existing models and methods. In practice, this successfully allowed the creation of new entities - the required safe and trusted digital ecosystems - on the basis of the development of digital and cyber security technologies, and the resulting changes in their behavioral preferences. Here, the ecosystem is understood as a certain system of organizations, created around a certain Technological Platform that use its services to make the best offers to customers and access to them to meet the ultimate needs of clients - legal entities and individuals. The basis of such ecosystems is a certain technological platform, created on advanced innovative developments, including the open interfaces and code, machine learning, cloud technologies, Big Data collection and processing, artificial intelligence technologies, etc. The mentioned Technological Platform allows creating the best offer for the client both from own goods and services and from the offers of external service providers in real time.

Guyader H.,No one rides for free! Three styles of collaborative consumption,2018,"Purpose: This paper aims to focus on collaborative consumption, that is, the peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange of goods and services facilitated by online platforms. Anchored in the access paradigm, collaborative consumption (e.g. accommodation rental and ridesharing services) differs from commercial services offered by firms (e.g. business-to-customer [B2C] carsharing). The aim of this study is to examine the nuanced styles of collaborative consumption in relation to market-mediated access practices and socially mediated sharing practices. Design/methodology/approach: Following the general research trend on mobility services, the context of long-distance ridesharing is chosen. Data collection was conducted using participant observation as peer service provider, 11 ethnographic interviews of consumers and a netnographic study of digital artifacts. Findings: Using practice theory, ten ridesharing activities were identified. These activities and the nuances in the procedures, understandings and engagements in the ridesharing practice led to the distinction of three styles of collaborative consumption: communal collaborative consumption, which is when participants seek pro-social relationships in belonging to a community; consumerist collaborative consumption, performed by participants who seek status and convenience in the access lifestyle; and opportunistic collaborative consumption, when participants seek to achieve monetary gain or personal benefits from abusive activities. Originality/value: By taking a phenomenological approach on collaborative consumption, this study adds to the understanding of the sharing economy as embedded in both a utilitarian/commercial economic system and a non-market/communal social system. The three styles of collaborative consumption propose a framework for future studies differentiating P2P exchanges from other practices (i.e. B2C access-based services and sharing). © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Access-based consumption; Collaborative consumption; Practice theory; Ridesharing; Sharing economy

One of the biggest challenges for competition authorities in the digital age is how to deal with data and privacy issues in their competitive analysis. An emerging issue is the role of competition in protecting consumers from potential privacy risks flowing from the increasing number of mergers in digital markets. The article considers how personal data in the digital economy are considered a currency in exchange for online offerings, and how a loss of privacy can be factored into quality competition.

"Deli E., Németh G.",Money does not talk: The image of money talks,2018,"There is an observable discrepancy between the real and virtual economy, as money stopped being the tool and essence of capitalism and the economy in the postmodern era. Money has become a purpose, a simulation, a viral virtual image. For this reason, we should rather say that it is no longer money, but the image of money that talks. The transparent digital convergence culture creates a borderless second world for the economy. This economy and our attitude towards it have never been so far removed from reality. Communication, information and economy have lost their referential nature. As soon as we get in contact with the virtual/digital world, we open our eyes onto the image and the transparency of images. A visual metaphor is a visual rhetorical tool that strives to express messages, to place emphasis on certain aspects of messages, and to convey a persuasive message. This paper aims to demonstrate visual metaphor chains that set a mirror between the real and virtual economy and that serve to show the changed attitude towards money. We illustrate our theoretical approach by analysing the multimodal metaphors that appear in a video clip from popular culture. © 2018 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest.",Postmodern; Real economy; Simulation; Virtual economy; Visual metaphor
Gardé V.,Digital audience management: Building and managing a robust data management platform for multi-channel targeting and personalisation throughout the customer journey,2018,"In today’s digital economy, marketing is increasingly driven by accurate data, thoughtfully constructed technology stacks (ie MarTech), Agile processes and constantly updated skill sets. Applications of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning — led by the rapid adoption of cloud computing — permeate most, if not all, marketing activities undertaken by small and large brands today. A data management platform (DMP) is at the heart of modern marketing: it combines data, technology, collaboration and multi-channel targeting/personalisation in ways that were unthinkable just a few years ago. Data privacy and consumer choices about how they would like their data to be used for better content play a very important role in this space. This paper covers key aspects of building a robust data management practice for medium and large firms that either already own a DMP or are looking to bring it in-house in the near future. The topics covered will also be very helpful for marketers wanting to make optimal use of DMPs owned by their agency partners. As always, no matter how good the data, it is invariably the correct composition of people, processes and technology that yields the best results. These critical aspects are highlighted herein along with tips on setting up experiments to evaluate success and to improve over time by adopting a ‘test and learn’ approach. © FedEx Services, 2018.",Audience; Data management platform; Demand-side platform; First-party data; Lookalike modelling; Personalisation; Targeting

Molz J.G.,Discourses of scale in network hospitality: From the Airbnb home to the global imaginary of 'belong anywhere',2018,"Tourists are increasingly turning to peer-to-peer platforms such as Airbnb to arrange homestays in their destinations. For better or for worse, these forms of network hospitality are transforming the hospitality landscape, with critical repercussions for home owners, residential neighbourhoods, local economies, urban planners and company investors and executives. These stakeholders often frame their discussion of the benefits and drawbacks of network hospitality in scalar terms. The article begins by analysing the discursive construction of spatial scales, spanning from the private enclaves of hosts' homes, to the public spaces of neighbourhoods and cities, to the global imaginary implied in Airbnb's motto 'Belong Anywhere'. It then asks how temporal and digital scales are also invoked in discourse about Airbnb, and with what ethical and political implications. Drawing on scholarly research, newspaper articles and corporate marketing materials, the analysis reflects critically on how scale is deployed to assert power, assign moral responsibility, and make claims to belonging in the context of network hospitality. © 2018 Intellect Ltd Article.

"Eckhardt J.T., Ciuchta M.P., Carpenter M.","Open innovation, information, and entrepreneurship within platform ecosystems",2018,"Research Summary: Companies sponsor platform ecosystems as an open innovation strategy to encourage complementors to develop complementary products, services, or technologies that can add value to the platform ecosystem. In this study, we develop and test an information-based theory of entrepreneurial activity within platform ecosystems. We postulate that ecosystems produce different types of information—a subset of which will foster entrepreneurship in the form of the commercialization of complementary products that were previously released for free. Our results indicate that product-specific information is associated with commercialization, but we fail to detect a relationship between market information and subsequent commercialization activity. Managerial Summary: The digital economy has led to a proliferation of platform ecosystems that harness external innovation. These ecosystems rely on complementors who enhance the value of platforms by creating complementary technologies. Hence, complementors' commercial viability is important. One such type of ecosystem is an app store, which enables complementors to introduce software that improves the platform product. App stores exist for a variety of software platforms, ranging from mobile phone operating systems (iOS and Android) to electronic medical record systems (Epic and Cerner). In this research, we find that complementors who introduce a free version of a mobile app are more likely to commercialize their app in response to specific types of information and platform designers should manage information in their platforms to foster platform viability. © 2018 Strategic Management Society",corporate entrepreneurship; entrepreneurial strategy; entrepreneurship; innovation; opportunity

Simon J.P.,Triggering the emergence of digital ecosystems: the role of mobile and video games in emerging economies,2018,"Purpose: This paper aims to shed some light on the role of video games within the media industry and IT sector, on its contribution to the production and distribution of digital content in emerging economies. It offers a case study on the role of mobile devices as a factor of transformation and shows how under changing socio–economic conditions, the transformations enabled the creation of digital ecosystems and innovative business models. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on desk research, a review of literature and trade press and comments from experts and industry players. Findings: The paper argues that as the internet is going mobile, driven by data – mostly video – the new mobile platforms are becoming the key for the distribution of content and mobile games. Whether it is the history of browser games in China, mobile games in India or PC games in Russia, each national gaming industry has required a unique strategy for making money, building on some prominent cultural factors and adapting to the local economic conditions. The paper reveals that video games are now clearly a vital part of digital content production in these countries, while stressing upon the role of public policies. Research limitations/implications: The paper relies mostly on industry and consultancy data, as in such a fast-changing environment official data even when accessible are in most cases too old to remain relevant to identify the trends and the fast changing stakes. This calls for some caution about the data. Therefore, the data used should be treated as just signals of potential trends, sufficient to provide an appropriate overview of the evolution of the global mobile ecosystem. Practical implications: This paper shows that the video games industry can serve as a pivot for the ICT industry. Besides, this prompts upstream and downstream industries of the entire digital entertainment market to thrive. Social implications: The paper shows that companies from emerging markets companies have been betting on a combination of factors: the development of the economies, the growth of the mobile market, emerging middle-classes and young customers. It provides a growth model that appears to be close to a “regular” industrial growth model. Originality/value: Although there is a growing academic literature on the video games industry, few research have been devoted to specific issues of emerging economies and to the role of video games within the media industry and IT sector. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",China; Developing countries; India; Mass media; Mobile communications systems; Public policy
"Bettoni A., Barni A., Sorlini M., Menato S., Giorgetti P., Landolfi G.",Multi-Sided Digital Manufacturing Platform Supporting Exchange of Unused Company Potential,2018,"The come to power of the sharing economy paradigm has incentivized the adoption of service-based business models largely relying on digital platforms providing the infrastructure and the ecosystems to sustain market uptake. The manufacturing domain isn't exempted from this trend, witnessing the growing launch of digital platforms with the aim of shifting value proposition towards a model relying on product servitization and share, instead of ownership. Most of the current examples in this domain are very narrowed-scope systems that just connect business providers or, when giving detailed services, these are dedicated to very specific manufacturing sectors (few machining operations available, few materials, etc.). This conceptual paper presents an application and extension of the Digital Platform Model to manufacturing services across Europe. A digital platform, called MANU-SQUARE and aiming at becoming the reference one-stop shop for European manufacturing is envisioned. Provision of customized services that adapt to different users' needs in cross-sectorial domains and coverage of the whole spectrum of value chain activities are its key features. On top of basic services, MANU-SQUARE creates the ground for a self-reinforcing knowledge, innovation and services ecosystem that, by creating more touch points for involved third parties, is able to remix and re-bundle the components making up the offering over time. © 2018 IEEE.",digital platform; manufacturing as a service; multi-sided business models; resource-efficiency; servitisation

Design/methodology/approach: This paper is exploratory, qualitative and inductive. Evidence is underpinned by a purposive sample, drawing on ten in-depth interviews and 17 open-ended survey responses collected across 2014 and 2015 – drawing perspectives from traders participating in the EAT Cambridge festival. Findings: This paper unpacks a series of serendipitous [as opposed to “strategic”] forms of festival and producer leveraging; strengthening B2C relationships and stimulating business to business networking and creative entrepreneurial collaborations. Positive emergent “embryonic” forms of event legacy are identified that support the longer-term sustainability of local producers and contribute towards an alternative idea of place and destination, more vibrant and authentic connectivity with localities and slower visitor experiences. Originality/value: This study emphasises the importance of local bottom-up forms of “serendipitous leverage” for enhancing positive emergent “embryonic” legacies that advance “slow” tourism and local food agendas. In turn, this enhances the cultural offering and delivers longer-term sustainability for small local producers – particularly vital in the era of “Clone Town” threats and effects.

Design/methodology/approach: The research encompasses 78 structured interviews with farmers’ market vendors in the central coast region of California. A descriptive statistical and exploratory analysis to capture and evaluate the extent of various clustering activities currently existing in FMs is presented. Findings: Analysis suggested an existing clustering behavior in FMs with different degrees that would enhance the role of these markets in local food economy. The improved social capital and financial performance of these markets shown in this study outperformed other cluster metrics monitored. Furthermore, there were some positive relationships between knowledge sharing (as a cluster activity) and both integration and financial activities among FMs vendors, highlighting interesting dynamics generated by the temporary nature of these clusters. Research limitations/implications: The study was based on an exploratory research design, investigating a selected number of vendors in the central coast region of California. The research does not claim to provide a comprehensive survey of all FMs. Practical implications: The analysis resulted in recommendations to improve efficiency of FMs’ practices at both the management level and the strategic level. These recommendations will enhance the contribution of these markets to the local food economy. The results also expand the practical knowledge bodies of regional and local food business development. Finally, the study highlights the social role of FMs through showing social capital as one of the main clustering drivers. Originality/value: This study contributes to theoretical knowledge concerning the impact of clusters on operation performance by exploring a new temporary proximity that can be added to the existing geographical and digital proximity enriching the clustering approaches debate.

Notwithstanding the potential broad cross-sectoral benefits, the natural environment, locality constraints, and incessant challenge of distance have impeded the balanced development of the bioeconomy. However, driven by digital solutions, the bioeconomy has taken big steps forward in recent years. Digitalization has enabled real-time, end-to-end supply chain visibility, improved delivery accuracy as well as stock level optimization and alignment with demand planning. The advancement of e-commerce has also led to the elimination of distance between both the upstream and the downstream of the chain. This paper demonstrates a transformative stream observed at the forefront of the forest-based bioeconomy chain. An empirical analysis focusing on the core business activities at the forefront, both upstream and downstream of the chain, is conducted. A new insight common to all industries in the digital economy is thus explored for constructing a creative disruption platform by embracing digital solutions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Creative disruption platform; Digital platform industry; Digital solutions; Forest-based bioeconomy; Transformation
Savelyev A.,Some risks of tokenization and blockchainizaition of private law,2018,"The paper focuses on the analysis of the problems that may be driven by mass tokenization of the objects of civil law, i.e. the creation of a digital representation of such objects in the form of a record in blockchain. This occurs where the value of such objects is transferred subsequently by means of disposal of such tokens, which is a subject of separate rights to it. The paper outlines two core problems, which were inspired by recent legislative activities in Belarus and Russia. The first is a possible displacement of existing legal regimes of objects of civil rights by the legal regime of the token. Secondly, the problem of definition of the nature of rights to tokens arises (in rem versus ad personam) as well as remedies for their violations.

"Massimino B., Gray J.V., Lan Y.",On the Inattention to Digital Confidentiality in Operations and Supply Chain Research,2018,"Digital assets are growing in scale, scope, and importance, amplifying the necessity to maintain their confidentiality. Yet, digital confidentiality has received vastly less research attention from operations and supply chain management (OSCM) scholars than cost, quality, flexibility, delivery, and innovation. We contend that this lack of attention has, at least partly, produced recommendations that ultimately could harm digital confidentiality performance. To guide future research, we synthesize relevant gaps across the OSCM and information systems literatures and discuss relevant OSCM research opportunities. Many of these opportunities are articulated as propositions. We also discuss contemporary industry practices aimed at upholding digital confidentiality. We call for the OSCM community to consistently and explicitly examine digital confidentiality as a performance dimension, and argue that failure to heed this call will be detrimental to our field's influence and relevance as digital assets continue to increase in value relative to physical ones. © 2018 Production and Operations Management Society",cybersecurity; digital economy; information security; information sharing; intellectual property
Querbes A.,Banned from the sharing economy: an agent-based model of a peer-to-peer marketplace for consumer goods and services,2018,"The emergence of profit-based online platforms related to the Sharing Economy, such as BlaBlaCar and Airbnb, provides new means for end users to create an income from their possessions. With this opportunity, participants have to make strategic economic decisions despite limited formal expertise and information. Decentralization (using digital technologies) and reputation (using user reviews) are the core mechanisms chosen by these platforms to mitigate these limitations and to work efficiently as online matchmakers. We test the performance of these two mechanisms by studying the allocative efficiency (in terms of value and volume of transactions) of simulated marketplaces under different types of motivation from the participants and control from the platforms. As a result, we find an inverted-U relationship between the decision-making leeway available to the participants and the platform’s allocative efficiency. From the participants’ perspectives, too much freedom or too many barriers lead to market failures affecting specific participants: low-end consumers are banned from the marketplace while high-end providers experience lower levels of activity. As governance advice for these platforms, we show the limitations of promoting these platforms on the sole motive of monetary rewards. © 2017, The Author(s).",Complex adaptive system; Decentralization; Sharing economy; User reviews

We have developed the concept of e-government, which has the effect of modernizing central and local public administrations to deliver public services to citizens and to business environment in an integrated, transparent and secure manner. In deeper research, we analyzed the E-Governance Development Index (EDGI) at European Union level and highlighted Romania's position, which is below the European Union average and hence the need to accelerate the digitization process for a faster and more sustainable development. Another relevant indicator was the Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI), which looks at the evolution of the EU member states in five main dimensions: connectivity, human capital, internet use, digital technologies integration, digital public services. The investigative method was the documentary and comparative analysis of data and information on the role of information and communication technologies provided by reports, statistics, and specialized articles available on the EU websites. We have also highlighted the strategic development lines of the government, which in our country are reflected in the following: Providing improved public services through the use of e-government, Promoting the adoption of eGovernment services, Optimizing the use of ICT in governmental operations. © 2018, SRAC - Romanian Society for Quality.

"Romanov V., Varfolomeeva A.",Digital enterprise synthesis based on web services composition,2018,"Today every customer is a digital customer, and every enterprise is a digital enterprise. The significantly changing business environment requires the enterprises to rapidly change their structures, processes and systems in order to save their customers and to remain competitive and compliant to the requirements of the modern digital economy. Existence of a large number of digital services in the Cloud does potentially possible both fast changing of the enterprise, and assembly of the new enterprises of atomic services. Automated planning algorithms are important part of such synthesis. In this chapter, we suggest to apply the theory of the formal grammar and the appropriate procedures as means of automated planning support for web services composition. Service composition tasks can end up being very complex, due to the security needs, especially while carrying out accounting and billing, dealing with personal data, managing access rights. A composite service can thus be defined using multiple smart-contracts that may be distributed on multiple ledgers. © 2018 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",Automated planning; Blockchain; Digital enterprise; Formal grammar; HTN planning; Web services composition
Nelson W.D.,Advances in business and management,2018,"Advances in Business and Management. Volume 15 begins by presenting a paper examining the depth and range of psychological stressors and strains that entrepreneurs encounter in their new ventures, aiming to further clarify the confusion and inconsistencies of being self-employed. The following study was conducted in order to analyze the impacts of IT on e-business adoption and to understand the effects of quality IT strategies in e-business performance. Focusing on Chinese users through an online survey, the measurement instrument of this research model was developed from various studies. The authors go on to discuss brand management and the way in which it attempts to tap into collective meanings, associating life-world categories of thought and emotion. A seduction takes place whereby a captured emotional involvement with advertisements confuses the imaginary with perception and circumvents rational thought prior to purchase-all likely to evolve in directions anticipated by the market specialists. One paper shows that the manner an organisation approaches strategic planning is significant. A case study rooted in stewardship, service and divine endowments develops theoretical findings drawing from biblical strategy and blends these with contemporary strategic human resource management. Social impact assessment (SIA) has become a recent concept of interest within the business and public domains, soliciting further study by academics. SIA is an interdisciplinary social science that incorporates various fields and is regarded as a technique for predicting social impacts as part of an environmental impact assessment (EIA) or as a stand-alone process. This book contributes to the knowledge base of SIA and its relationship with b-corporations and integrated reporting, providing insights between these two fields of research. The penultimate current chapter embraces a topic which is still underdeveloped in the literature: how corporate social responsibility may or may not influence brand equity. Therefore, the authors conducted a literature review to analyse past studies on this topic, focusing on four major aspects. Today every customer is digital customer, and every enterprise is digital enterprise. It is proposed that the significantly changing business environment requires enterprises to rapidly change their structures, processes and systems in order to save their customers and to remain competitive and compliant to the requirements of the modern digital economy. © 2018 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

It also considers the advantages of information technology in the promotion of e-tourism. The development of e-tourism is connected with the fact that today's world community cannot be imagined without a variety of portable technical means. The possibilities of the Internet are attractive to potential tourists by the fact that they can, quite independently, become acquainted with the country they intend to visit, learn about sights and hotels, as well gain an impression of local living conditions. Gradually, travellers have begun to increasingly please their trust in such innovations as electronic visa and e-tickets, and indeed use them, which makes it possible to talk about the rapid development of e-tourism. The international tourism multiplier for Kazakhstan has also been calculated (k = 1.15). It shows the degree of increase in the incomes of local residents with an increase in the expenditure of foreign tourists per unit. © Institute of Society Transformation, 2018.",Digital Tourism; E-Tourism; Information and Communication Technologies; Tourism Industry
"Dal Zotto P., Colombero S., Pigni F., Haggège M.",Customers becoming creators: how firms leverage technology and consumers for new value,2018,"Purpose: The rapid development of information and communication technologies (ICTs) has facilitated consumers’ involvement in firms’ value creation processes through increasingly near real-time information exchanges. This strategic opportunity configures new forms of ICT-enabled collaboration between firms and consumers. Firms can now immediately react to consumers’ requests/complaints, having gained real-time visibility of consumers’ actions and behaviors. Despite the increasing deployment of ICT-enabled value co-creation projects, managers still poorly apprehend them as high-potential strategic initiatives. Design/methodology/approach: This paper investigates this gap through a multiple qualitative case study based on 17 organizations that successfully implement ICT-based value co-creation initiatives, including Lego, Netflix and Blablacar. Findings: This study identifies two dimensions of the ICTs’ value co-creation process, namely, the firms’ involvement and customers’ role, in this co-creation process. Through these dimensions, four ICT-based co-creation initiatives are observed and defined: community, customers’ contributions create the firms’ value proposition (FVP); customization, customers’ service consumption personalize FVP; reputation, customers’ contributions about the offered services completes the FVP; and sense, an algorithmic approach, designed to focus on learning from customers’ consumption tailors FVP. Originality/value: This study advances a framework supporting managerial decision-making concerning the aptitude of co-creation initiatives to meet organizational goals. Managers may gain insight from its use especially in assessing emerging opportunities to engage consumers in the value creation process. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Consumer work; Digital economy; Digital strategy; IT value; Strategic initiative; Value co-creation

"Pantano E., Gandini A.",Shopping as a “networked experience”: an emerging framework in the retail industry,2018,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to devise a comprehensive framework of the emergent shopping experience as the result of the combination of store access and the use of communication technologies, particularly social media. Design/methodology/approach: The paper builds on a set of 20 semi-structured interviews to London-based young consumers aged 18-23 and adopts an exploratory approach aimed at understanding the broad relationship between retailing and social media use. Findings: The findings highlight how an intensive use of social media and digital communication technologies emerges as an integral part of the shopping experience inside and outside the store. Research limitations/implications: Drawing upon the notion of the “experience economy,” scholars and practitioners are actually pushed to reconsider the role of traditional shopping as in-store experience that is evolving fast as an effect of the continuous progress into communication technologies. This concept contributes to knowledge development by linking research in retail with work in the area of consumer culture. Practical implications: Marketers and retailers should consider that the shopping experience is no longer limited to the physical point of sale. This means that retailers should be able to provide a shopping experience that is natively networked. Originality/value: The authors identify the emerging “networked experience” of shopping, which derives from the consumers’ widespread usage of new communication technologies to collect information, their willingness to share part of this information with others, while creating new digitally mediated relationships with retailers. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Consumer co-creation; Experience economy; Networked experience; Retailing; Service economy; Shopping experience

This paper also clarifies how the remanufacturing process should be communicated and circular fashion marketed to consumers. Design/methodology/approach: The research methodology consisted of consumer interviews, utilising an online innovation platform (Owela) to involve consumers and workshops with project partners and with external stakeholders. Findings: Consumers’ interest towards recycling and sustainable solutions has increased. They appreciate the idea of recycling textile waste to produce new clothes; circular products should become “the new normal”. Consumers are asking for more visible and concrete information about circular clothing and how their behaviour has affected the environmental aspects of textile production. The communication should be timed correctly by using multiple communication channels and also paying attention to the shopping experience. In addition, digital services alongside circular clothing could create additional value for consumers. Research limitations/implications: In this study, only consumers from Finland were involved. The results might be different in different parts of Europe and especially worldwide. Originality/value: This study focusses on circular clothing – an area that has not been studied much before. Also, consumers involved in this study were of a different age compared to most of the previous studies, where the focus has been mainly on young college students. © 2018, Kaisa Vehmas, Anne Raudaskoski, Pirjo Heikkilä, Ali Harlin and Aino Mensonen.",Circular clothing; Circular economy; Co-creation; Communication; Consumers; Relooping fashion

Whether this presents an opportunity or a challenge for small and medium organisations depends on how these organisations approach it, strategically. Specifically, organisations that are guided by a combination of market, learning and entrepreneurial orientations are well-positioned to take advantage of the opportunities presented by digital technologies because they adopt attitudes and behaviours that support the generation and use of market insight, proactive innovation and openness to new ideas. We call this combination the digital orientation (DO), and present a set of propositions that facilitate its development.

"Kumar A., Salo J.",Effects of link placements in email newsletters on their click-through rate,2018,"Firms adopting email marketing strategy often complain about low click-through rate (CTR). Scarcity of attention in this digital economy requires including psychological aspects of consumer behavior into the design considerations of digital contents. In this study, we propose differential effects of link placements in email newsletter on their CTR. We explain the observed effects of link placements on CTR drawing concepts from psychology and visual heuristics. The empirical analysis confirms that when it comes to clicking on the links of a newsletter, the click-through follows a U-pattern, i.e. as users traverse the links placed on a U-path their responsiveness decreases gradually. Thus, links placed in the left region of an email newsletter have higher impact than those placed in the right region with links in the top-left region having highest impact. Insights gained from this study can be used in the design consideration of email newsletters. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",Email marketing; link placement; SNARC effect; visual heuristics

We argue here that the confluence of technology and the Silk Road is not new. During the Ancient Silk Road, China’s indigenous innovations diffused to other economies (the first process of diffusion). What is new this time is that much of the innovations may have originated in Silicon Valley, California. However, China adapted, metamorphosized some such inventions and at the same time independently created many technology business models. Through the New Silk Road, China may carry out a second diffusion process and spread innovations from Silicon Valley to other BRI countries. To enrich the study of the Digital Silk Road, we construct a formal, economic model of a connected region and show how this can affect Internet start-ups and their entrepreneurs.

Discussion has been limited regarding how an ad agency coordinates and connects multiple activities and relationships, and how the agency setup has evolved over time. This question has become particularly interesting in the age of digitization, in which new forms of advertising require new ways of organizing production. In a case study of Forbes’s BrandVoice unit, this article specifically examines native advertising production via the business model lens, illustrating how BrandVoice consciously borrows production logics from journalism and distribution practices of platform economies.

The analysis builds on a free guided-tour company in Copenhagen. Data is collected in a bottom-up reiterative process, drawing on theories on disruptive innovation and network theory. Between 2013 and 2016, one of the free tour companies in Copenhagen was followed by means of participant observations, interviews with tour guides and interpretation of online documents. Results show that free guided tours based on tips alone and orchestrated within the frame of the sharing economy are not merely a product innovation. More importantly, they entail disruptive market innovations that circumvent traditional industry structures and ultimately produce disruptive organizational innovations where trust in network is the crux. Free guided-tour companies operate as communitarian organizations in extractive business models, and they are game changers in the field of guided tours, and ultimately in the field of tourism. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

"Joe-Wong C., Sen S.","Harnessing the Power of the Cloud: Revenue, Fairness, and Cloud Neutrality",2018,"Cloud computing is a transformational technology that reduces upfront infrastructure costs, democratizes access to computing and storage capacity, and helps businesses innovate and compete in the digital economy. However, the distribution of these significant social and economic benefits among the various stakeholders in the cloud ecosystem will critically depend on pricing and resource allocation decisions made by cloud providers. These decisions impact not only the provider revenue, but also the fairness of resources allocated among cloud users and the overall social welfare. Several unique features of cloud computing (e.g., the presence of multiple, nonfungible resources and heterogeneous users) make the interplay between these competing objectives hard to understand. To truly harness the power of cloud computing and to establish regulatory benchmarks, there is a need for frameworks that quantify how resource allocation and pricing choices affect different objectives. In this work, we introduce an analytical model that incorporates user utility, endogenous pricing, fairness among heterogeneous users, social welfare, and cloud provider revenue. We identify conditions under which there is a tradeoff between fairness and revenue, and quantify the extent of this tradeoff by formulating an optimization problem in which a cloud provider maximizes its revenue, subject to constraints on the desired level of fairness. Our work provides an initial step toward developing regulatory policies for cloud neutrality to ensure an equitable distribution of the transformative benefits of the cloud. ©, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Cloud computing; cloud neutrality; fairness; IT regulation; resource allocation; revenue distribution; social welfare

For this, methods of the regression and correlation analysis based on the statistics of IMD World Competitiveness Center, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation, the World Bank, UNDP, OECD and the International Monetary Fund for 2013-2017 are used. As a result, the conclusion is drawn that the consequences of the digitalization of the Russian economy for human capital are ambiguous. On the one hand, in the interests of building a digital economy, the state increases expenditures for the development of human capital (expenditures on social policy, on education and on R & D). On the other hand, the misuse of these funds leads to a slight increase in the effectiveness of the use of human capital and does not allow achieving a high rate of digitalization of the Russian economy. To solve this problem, authors’ recommendations aimed at targeted (digital) spending of funds for the development of human capital and standardization of the use of digital technologies are proposed. Their practical implementation will allow overcoming the revealed contradiction and guaranteeing the positive impact of the process of digitalization of the Russian economy on human capital related to improving the efficiency of its management by reducing the need for public funding and increasing the effectiveness of the use of human capital.

"Ragulina J.V., Suglobov A.E., Melnik M.V.",Transformation of the role of a man in the system of entrepreneurship in the process of digitalization of the Russian economy,2018,"The purpose of this work is to identify and analyze transformations connected with the role of a man in the system of entrepreneurship in the process of digitalization of the Russian economy, as well as to develop framework recommendations for the successful adaptation of a contemporary worker to the new digital reality. For this purpose, the methods of regression and correlation analysis have been used. As a result, the authors conclude that in the process of digitalization of the Russian economy, significant transformations of the role of man in the system of entrepreneurship indeed take place. However, they are not related to a decrease in the need for human resources, but to a change in the direction of their use. So, human resources from the source of labor become a source of intellectual activity associated with ensuring the introduction of digital technologies into business processes and creating innovations, while routine processes are increasingly performed by digital technologies without participation of a man (or under his control). To successfully adapt a modern worker to the new digital reality, the authors’ model has been developed and presented, in which relevant framework recommendations have been proposed. As a result of their practical implementation, a modern worker will acquire stable competitive advantages on the labor market, which guarantee high demand in the conditions of digitalization of the economy. This helps to maintain and improve the competitiveness of a modern employee on the labor market in the situation of digitalization of the Russian economy. © 2018, SRAC - Romanian Society for Quality.

Drawing on research in Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, we find that the specific nature of the online freelancing labour process gives rise to a distinctive form of organisation, in which social media groups play a central role in structuring communication and unions are absent. Previous research is limited to either conventional freelancers or ‘microworkers’ who do relatively low-skilled tasks via online labour platforms. This study uses 107 interviews and a survey of 658 freelancers who obtain work via a variety of online platforms to highlight that Internet-based communities play a vital role in their work experiences. Internet-based communities enable workers to support each other and share information. This, in turn, increases their security and protection. However, these communities are fragmented by nationality, occupation and platform. © 2018 Brian Towers (BRITOW) and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",collective action; collective organisation; digital labour; freelance; gig economy; Southeast Asia; Sub-Saharan Africa; union

For this purpose, a method for estimating the degree of digitization of the (higher) education system has been developed and applied. As a result, it is found that at the present time (2018), the greatest degree of digitalization is characteristic for additional indicators of the functioning of the system of (higher) education in contemporary Russia, such as the work of library resources and state and public monitoring. At the same time, the degree of digitalization of key indicators (educational and research activities of universities) is low. At the same time, the infrastructure for digitalization of the Russian system of (higher) education is sufficiently developed, which determines significant opportunities for the further development of this process. The final degree of digitization of the Russian system of (higher) education is estimated at 25.8% and is very low. The reason for this problem lies in the inadequate state regulation of the process of digitalization of the Russian system of (higher) education. To solve the problem, the authors developed and presented a new (improved) approach to state regulation of the digitalization of the Russian system of (higher) education. This approach implies full-scale financing of relevant activities, priority promotion of digitalizing the main activities of the (higher) education system, as well as orientation to the proposed model for the functioning and development of a (higher) education system based on digital technologies. Its practical implementation will increase the efficiency and competitiveness of the Russian system of (higher) education. © 2018, SRAC - Romanian Society for Quality.

In Fourier space, integral representations for the option prices are derived via the theory on matrix Wiener–Hopf factorizations. Our main focus is on the 2-state case where the matrix Wiener–Hopf factorization is available analytically. A comparison to several numerical alternatives (analytical approximations, the Brownian bridge algorithm and a finite element scheme) demonstrates that the pricing formulas are easy to implement and lead to accurate price estimates. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Markov switching; Option pricing; Regime switching; Wiener–Hopf factorization
"Rajakallio K., Cuthbertson R., Pulkka L., Junnila S.",Creating urban platforms — Opportunities and challenges for innovation in commercial real estate development,2018,"Current theories on commercial urban development are dominated by the concept of linearity, which does not adequately take into account the demands of adaptation posed by the pace of change in digital developments, a pace that stands in marked contrast to the pace of change in physical developments. In the hi-tech sector, platform ecosystems have been employed to accommodate innovation and change. This paper explores the potential application of platform ecosystem theory to the commercial urban development process, where there is now great uncertainty regarding the future economic implications and societal requirements of physical commercial space. The boundary conditions for value creation in platform ecosystems are as follows: modularity, standardisation, complementarity and connectivity. Each is explored through a survey of key actors in recently completed commercial urban developments. The analysis identifies significant differences in the capacity of public- and private-sector actors to promote the creation of platform ecosystems, particularly in the complementary actions of development participants. Applying an approach to urban development based on a platform ecosystem might offer great opportunities, but will also be limited by the major challenges identified in this paper. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Complementarity; Connectivity; Modularity; Platform ecosystem; Urban development; Value creation

"Frischauf N., Horn R., Kauerhoff T., Wittig M., Baumann I., Pellander E., Koudelka O.",NewSpace: New Business Models at the Interface of Space and Digital Economy: Chances in an Interconnected World,2018,"According to Wikipedia, ""NewSpace"" is an umbrella term for a movement and philosophy that is often affiliated with, but not synonymous with, an emergent private spaceflight industry. Specifically, the term is used to refer to a community of relatively new aerospace companies working to develop low-cost access to space or spaceflight technologies and advocates of low-cost spaceflight technology and policy.∗ Although this description may be arguable, the emergence of numerous start-up space ventures within the past 15 years is a fact. These start-ups cover diverse areas such as satellite communications, Earth observation, launchers, manned spaceflight and space tourism, or even energy from space as well as resource gathering in space. Companies have attracted more than $13.3 billion of investment, including $5.1 billion in debt financing, since 2000. More than 80 angel- and venture-backed space companies have been founded since 2000. Eight of these have since been acquired, at a total value of $2.2 billion.† The NewSpace movement has so far been focused, to a great extent, on the United States, namely the West Coast. Mojave in California has been dubbed ""the Silicon Valley on NewSpace,"" being home to several of these commercial space enterprises. The German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) has launched a study for understanding the driving forces behind the NewSpace ecosystem and related chances and challenges for Germany and Europe. The study, which was conducted by SpaceTec Partners and BHO Legal of Germany, shows that at least four factors are of immanent importance for a NewSpace ecosystem to create market-driven products and services. These factors are related to: (1) Business Philosophy - creating and living an entrepreneurial spirit; (2) Financing - access to early stage risk capital and venture funding; (3) Technology Management - focus on spinning-in technologies and Information and Communication Technology processes; and (4) Framework Conditions - favorable political and legal conditions supporting commercialization. This article summarizes the insights gained and the lessons learned from success stories and failures in NewSpace. It presents the recommendations for strategies as to how NewSpace can be successful in Europe and, in particular, in Germany. Given the growing relevance of NewSpace, these insights are of high interest to stakeholders and decision makers worldwide. © 2018 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",business philosophy; entrepreneurs; financing; Germany; private spaceflight industry; start-ups
"Ratzinger D., Amess K., Greenman A., Mosey S.",The impact of digital start-up founders’ higher education on reaching equity investment milestones,2018,"This paper builds on human capital theory to assess the importance of formal education among graduate entrepreneurs. Using a sample of 4953 digital start-ups the paper evaluates the impact of start-up founding teams’ higher education on the probability of securing equity investment and subsequent exit for investors. The main findings are: (1), teams with a founder that has a technical education are less likely to remain self-financed and are more likely to secure equity investment and to exit, but the impact of technical education declines with higher level degrees, (2) teams with a founder that has doctoral level business education are less likely to remain self-financed and have a higher probability of securing equity investment, while undergraduate and postgraduate business education have no significant effect, and (3) teams with a founder that has an undergraduate general education (arts and humanities) are less likely to remain self-financed and are more likely to secure equity investment and exit while postgraduate and doctoral general education have no significant effect on securing equity investment and exit. The findings enhance our understanding of factors that influence digital start-ups achieving equity milestones by showing the heterogeneous influence of different types of higher education, and therefore human capital, on new ventures achieving equity milestones. The results suggest that researchers and policy-makers should extend their consideration of universities entrepreneurial activity to include the development of human capital. © 2017, The Author(s).",Digital economy; Equity investments; Human capital; University qualifications
"Jin S.T., Kong H., Wu R., Sui D.Z.","Ridesourcing, the sharing economy, and the future of cities",2018,"As an integral part of the emerging sharing economy, ridesourcing refers to transportation services that connect community drivers with passengers via mobile devices and applications. The spectacular growth of ridesourcing has sparked a burgeoning literature discussing how it affects the future of cities. This paper presents a systematic review of the existing literature concerning the impact of ridesourcing on the efficiency, equity, and sustainability of urban development. Ridesourcing has a positive impact on economic efficiency. It both complements and competes with public transit, but its influence on traffic congestions near city centers is still unclear. Regarding urban equity, ridesourcing further amplifies the issue of the digital divide and raises concerns over the issues of discrimination and data privacy and security. It is also hotly contested whether prosumers (producers/consumers) are exploited by the sharing economy platforms, whether ridesourcing drivers are reasonably compensated, and how to better protect on-demand workers’ rights. Even though ridesourcing has been promoting a green image, its true environmental impact has not been thoroughly investigated. According to the evidence reported in the literature so far, it is unlikely that ridesourcing will reduce private car ownership. Ridesourcing's impacts on energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions are uncertain based on existing research. This paper outlines the danger of conceptual confusion and the methodological issues in the existing literature. Further research is sorely needed as the future of cities is indisputably tied to the sharing economy and its impacts on shared mobility. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Future cities; On-demand work; Ridesourcing; Shared mobility; The sharing economy

"Täuscher K., Laudien S.M.",Understanding platform business models: A mixed methods study of marketplaces,2018,"Recent technological advances have enabled the emergence of novel business models based on digital platforms. Marketplace like Airbnb or Uber offer such digital platforms to connect previously unmatched demand-side and supply-side participants through innovative forms of value creation, delivery and capture. While countless firms claim to offer the next ‘Airbnb for X’ or ‘Uber for Y’, we lack knowledge about the defining business model characteristics of these marketplaces. To close the gap, this paper provides a conceptually and empirically grounded taxonomy of their business models. Applying a mixed methods approach, it first develops an integrative framework of marketplace business models. Guided by the framework, the research systematically analyzes 100 randomly selected marketplaces with content analysis and binary coding. The gathered data is analyzed with cluster analysis techniques to develop a taxonomy for marketplace business models. The clustering process reveals six clearly distinguishable types of marketplace business models and thus shows that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to creating, delivering, and capturing value with marketplaces and platforms in general. We characterize these distinctive types on basis of the qualitative and quantitative findings. Among others, we find that two of these types are highly aligned with business model characteristics associated with the so-called sharing economy. The findings are discussed against platform, marketplace, and sharing economy literature to contribute to a higher integration of different literature streams that are concerned with similar organizational types and phenomena. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Business models; Digital economy; Marketplaces; Mixed methods approach; Platforms
Sharma Y.,How customer analytics and digital technologies drive banks to understand consumer awareness towards financial inclusion,2018,"In today's switching economy, customers' needs are changing and they are demanding more transparency, higher involvement, and clear communication in day-to-day banking processes. The rationale behind carrying out the present research is to identify the role of customer analytics in the new digital customer journey in terms of enhancing their engagement, loyalty, and satisfaction. The present research emphasizes opportunities that would accrue to financial institutions after demonetization and collecting large amount of demographics, customer transaction, and account-related data. Primary data was collected from 300 customers through a structured questionnaire to know their perceptions about the role of customer analytics and digital technologies to build their confidence and capability to use financial services.

"Aaronson S.A., Leblond P.",Another digital divide: The rise of data realms and its implications for the WTO,2018,"Individuals, businesses, and governments increasingly use data to create new services delivered via the internet. In so doing, they are creating a new economy built on cross-border data flows. The USA, the European Union, and China are using domestic and foreign policies to reap data-based economies of scale and scope. Essentially, they have created three distinct data realms with different approaches to data governance. As a result, they have fostered a new digital divide: Between the three data behemoths and other countries that are rule takers. This situation presents the WTO with a challenge and an opportunity. These three data realms could undermine the ability of the WTO to govern trade in data flows, but it also creates pressures for the three data realms to use WTO mechanisms to find common ground among their approaches. Moreover, it could provide an incentive to WTO members to create new rules governing trade in data. © 2018 The Author(s). All rights reserved.",

This was predictable given the importance of data for trade in the digital economy, especially e-commerce. However, there is a major discord between WTO members on issues relating to data flows and data localization. This article sets out to understand how data flows across borders and the types of trade restrictive data localization measures members use. The analysis of various restrictions on data flows imposed by states reflects the different objectives behind them, targeting all or specific types of data. Such regulations potentially violate existing WTO commitments.

Rietveld J.,Creating and capturing value from freemium business models: A demand-side perspective,2018,"Research Summary: While it has long been recognized that the business model can be a source of performance heterogeneity, less is known about how the business model affects consumers' perceptions about a firm's products and services. By taking a demand-side perspective, I argue that business models create and capture value when the elements that compose a business model improve how consumers perceive a firm's products and better enable heterogeneous consumers to act on their willingness-to-pay. I develop theory on how the freemium business model competes with the premium business model and test hypotheses in the market for digital PC games. Results show that freemium games are played less and generate less revenues and that greater variety in games' menus of paid items is associated with higher revenues. Managerial Summary: Freemium business models are increasingly prevalent in the digital economy, yet very little is known about how freemium affects consumers' perceptions of value and their willingness-to-pay. In this article, I study how the freemium business model competes with the premium business model in the market for digital PC games. Results show that freemium games are played less and generate less revenues than premium games and that greater variety in games' menus of paid items is associated with higher revenues. This implies that in order to achieve competitive parity with firms operating the premium business model, firms operating the freemium business model need to create more value (e.g., through improved product quality, income from advertisements, or unlocking network externalities) or operate at lower costs.

Kelsey J.,How a TPP-style E-commerce outcome in the WTO would endanger the development dimension of the GATS acquis (and Potentially the WTO),2018,"The World Trade Organization (WTO) faces a watershed. Developed country Members want to abandon the Doha round and negotiate ' new issues', notably electronic commerce, as part of a broader US-led strategy to rewrite the global trade rules for the 21st century. Developing countries insist the Doha round be concluded before considering new issues and most reject the e-commerce agenda as foreclosing their options for digital development. This standoff dominated the MC11. The new e-commerce agenda has its genesis in the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Three factors complicate moves to export it to the WTO. First, those rules are blunt instruments designed to protect the first mover status and oligopolistic power of Big Tech. Second, they lack any development flexibilities or obligations. Third, their application to major developing country competitors and the potentially lucrative markets of larger developing countries requires multilateralization through the WTO, but that will be a highly contested process. That contest is now playing out through the plurilateral process announced by the e-commerce proponents during the MC11. The proposals assume a major expansion of Members' commitments under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). Favourable interpretations of sectoral classifications, modes of trading services, and the application of technological neutrality to historical commitments would override the original GATS acquis that ensures developing countries can control their exposure, and seriously diminish their regulatory autonomy to maximize the opportunities of the digital economy and minimize the risks. Such an agenda could deepen the crisis at the WTO. © 2018 The Author(s). All rights reserved.",

We report on a comprehensive picture of manufacturing sourcing on a global basis. Academic/practical relevance: With dynamic changes in global economic, political, and technological conditions, the design of global supply chain strategies has become critically important for executives and has great potential for operations management research. Methodology: Our work is based on a global field study conducted in 2014 and 2015 among leading manufacturers from a wide range of industries. The data set has the distinguishing feature of reflecting actual decisions that the firms made recently (during the last three years). Results: Companies are currently restructuring their global production footprints. The majority of firms engage in offshoring. Reshoring does occur but seldom for corrective reasons. China remains the most attractive site for production sourcing, followed by Eastern Europe and Southern Asia. Manufacturing continues to decline in the developed economies of Japan and Western Europe. We observe that while North America may be at the cusp of a manufacturing renaissance, such a change is not just because of reshoring by domestic firms. Labor cost no longer dominates manufacturing location decisions; rather, firms decide based on complex trade-offs among a variety of factors. Finally, firms localize production in developed economies and use developing economies as production hubs. Managerial implications: Our goal in this paper is to inform both managerial policy decisions and the academic research agenda by developing insights on managerial practices that concern production sourcing and on the factors that drive such decisions. We develop hypotheses concerning how firms make these strategy decisions, and we discuss implications for analytical and empirical research.

"Rao M.K., Murthi K.R.S., Raj B.",Future Indian Space: Perspectives of Game Changers,2018,"In the past 50 years, Indian Space has seen many successful milestones, demonstrating excelling Indian technology and widespread utilization of space services in different areas of the national economy. Present capabilities and capacities of Indian Space are mainly in the unitary capabilities of the national space agency - this has enabled the nation to significantly achieve about 10-12 high-quality missions every year. Meeting future domestic needs and benefiting by access to a large global market of space will require a quantum jump in capabilities and capacities to be served. Another important development is the aspirational growth of the Indian economy and the people. With a gross domestic product (GDP) growth hovering around 7%-8% and a few trillion dollar economy, the nation has launched important developmental initiatives - Digital India, Make in India, Smart City, Swach Bharat, National Education Mission, and National Skill Mission programs. Thus, demands for diverse applications of space technology are inevitable, integrating across geographical, sectoral, and temporal domains of the country. In an earlier suo-moto study, we have outlined the future 10-20 years of policy perspectives for Indian Space development and also outlined the perspectives of how a national space ecosystem would emerge, evolving from the present national space agency into a public-private-academia triad. Looking ahead into such a national ecosystem, we now visualize critical developments that will bring impacting and paradigm shifts to holistic Indian Space through the triad - game changers. With about 100-150 possible missions in the coming 10-20 years - encompassing earth observation, satellite communications, positioning, space science, planetary missions, operational and advanced launch access missions, and the initiation of a human spaceflight program - the critical shifts would be not just technological advancements but also organizational restructuring from emerging newer organizational arrangements, industrialization and emergence of private space industry, deeper penetration of space services in Indian society, increasing global presence of Indian players, and a vibrant cooperative and collaboration at the international level. What will drive these game changers? Cost efficiency will be one key driver amply demonstrated in many sectors for global markets; this will impact global space markets and bring a leveling effect across global markets. Indian skills and human resources will be another driver, with Indian scientists, engineers, and managers playing a major role in the national and global space. Third will be Indian innovation - the ability to improvise and innovate with simple low-cost, but effective, solutions. These three drivers will bring a new economic model that balances systems, costs, and performance. The article provides a perspective of future Indian Space and outlines game changer impacts that will emerge for space activities in India.

Alvarez León L.F.,Information Policy and the Spatial Constitution of Digital Geographic Information Markets,2018,"Information policy has become one of the key instruments for the commodification and marketization of goods in contemporary capitalism. However, the spatializing role of this and other legal regimes has not been explored in depth. Among the categories of goods whose production and circulation is shaped by information policy, geographic information is increasingly salient in the digital economy due to the strategic and economic value derived from its integration of location and context. This article explores the role of information policy regimes in spatially bounding, structuring, and regulating digital geographic information markets. This is conducted through a Polanyian economic geographic approach that contextualizes, integrates, and synthesizes two types of geographic information market formations, and focuses on the institutional dimension of information policy regimes. In developing this approach, the article argues that legal regimes (in this case information policy) are capable of spatializing markets by structuring, integrating, and delimiting the actions of states and other actors, such as private corporations and consumers, within particular jurisdictions. The empirical section of the article illustrates this argument by showing how three aspects of information policy—(1) intellectual property, (2) infrastructure, and (3) commercialization—shape specific configurations of digital geographic information markets within the various administrative scales in the European Union, a globally influential jurisdiction for information policy, and where a regional digital market is in the process of construction. The article concludes by arguing that a Polanyian economic geographic approach provides a solid basis with ample versatility to account for the necessary integration of a legal perspective into the analysis of new kinds of goods (such as digital geographic information) and the spatialities of their emerging market configurations. © 2017 Clark University.",digital economy; geographic information; information markets; information policy; intellectual property; legal frameworks

Despite recent technological shifts rendering digital media portable in the form of smartphones, tablets, and laptops, attracting new categories of gamers, most notably women above the age of 35, the video game industry is struggling to handle its masculine domination, prescribing specific and gendered divisions of labor in terms of lowering thresholds for female video game developers. This article reports on empirical material based on interviews from the burgeoning Swedish video game industry and suggests that female professionals entering the industry encounter inherited gendered beliefs and ways of organizing work which locate women in specific, and not always desirable, roles within the industry. In this regime of masculine domination, the study concludes, female video game developers are understood as a particular group primarily knowledgeable about female gamers’ preferences and not as the possessors of general skills attractive to the video game companies. Ultimately, the masculine domination and the historical gendered divisions of labor are preventing the industry from creating more gender-equal workplaces and, as a consequence, fully exploiting market potentials. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",female professionals; gender relations; professional role confidence; video game development

"Kimura F., Chen L.",Value Chain Connectivity in Indonesia: The Evolution of Unbundlings,2018,"This paper applies the conceptual framework of ‘unbundling’, proposed by Baldwin (2016), to assess the value chain connectivity in Indonesia. Indonesia is a geographically large country, and three different levels of unbundling co-exist. The first unbundling aligns with the industry-wise international division of labour in plantation agriculture, mining, and labour-intensive industries; the second aligns with where the task-wise international division of labour dominates mainly in machinery industries; and the third aligns with where face-to-face costs are reduced by the digital economy. We argue that the further upgrading of unbundling and the more effective use of advanced piecemeal technologies among different levels of unbundling will enable Indonesia to achieve rapid and equitable economic development. Overcoming distance is key for effectively using the mechanics of unbundling. We propose that three key elements are be promoted: enhancement of connectivity, development of the service sector, and improvement of the policy environment. © 2018, © 2018 ANU Indonesia Project.",connectivity; distance; global value chains; information and communication technology; international division of labour
"Zenebe A., Alsaaty F.M., Anyiwo D.","Relationship between individual's entrepreneurship intention, and adoption and knowledge of information technology and its applications: an empirical study",2018,"Entrepreneurial tendency appears to be influenced by individuals’ adoption and knowledge of information technology (IT) and its applications. This is mainly due to the shift in business environment to digital economy and the dependence on IT. Scholars have overlooked the relationships between individuals’ IT adoption and knowledge, and entrepreneurial tendency. This research addresses this gap in the literature. We surveyed 169 students using questionnaire that measures their enterprising tendency, IT knowledge, and IT adoption. The results of correlation analysis showed significant positive relationships between individuals’ entrepreneurial tendency, on the one hand, and their IT knowledge and IT adoption, on the other hand. Furthermore, the results of the analysis of variance revealed significant differences in the relationships by gender and age. The practical implication of this research is that entrepreneurial institutions and development centers need to incorporate IT and its applications at the front end in their effort to train entrepreneurs. © 2017, © 2017 Journal of the Canadian Council for Small Business and Entrepreneurship/Conseil de la PME et de l'entrepreneuriat.",Adoption des technologies de l'information; Connaissance des technologies de l'information; Entrepreneurial intention; General measure of enterprising tendency (GET2) test; Information technology adoption; information technology knowledge; Intention entrepreneuriale; Test de la mesure générale de la tendance entrepreneuriale (GET2)

Drawing upon interviews with 25 high school students in rural and remote Queensland, Australia, this article investigates the relationship among rural students’ social and cultural capital, their families, and their attitude towards higher education. The students originate from a sample who are interested in careers in the digital arena and who see the value of participating in the digital economy. Building cultural and social capital through higher education offers career and social opportunities to those who come from disadvantaged backgrounds. Existing cultural and capital, however, can play a substantial role in the decisions that influence rural youth toward, or away from, higher education. Interview data suggests family members are strong influences on young rural people making decisions about their future. Parents and older family members inspire students to pursue higher education, while siblings and cousins who attending university offer firsthand information about university life. Data also emphasise students’ concerns about moving from their country hometowns, and awareness of physical barriers, such as distance and money. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Cultural capital; regional youth; siblings; university
"Oses Fernández N., Kepa Gerrikagoitia J., Alzua-Sorzabal A.",Sampling method for monitoring the alternative accommodation market,2018,"Tourism is an extremely competitive industry where effective destination management is necessary to compete. One of the main destination management stakeholders is the hotel industry. Since the advent of the Internet websites that facilitate the sharing economy, the hotel industry has had to compete with an alternative accommodation market. This alternative market is difficult to monitor as there is no official data. Current research works on developing methods for calculating tourism metrics for a destination based on digital footprint with the objective of offering figures to complement official statistics. The objective of our research is to develop a method to monitor the alternative accommodation market based on data collected from Airbnb. This paper reports the results of the first step: the design of a sampling method for data scraping from this website that provides a representative sample of the accommodation offer of the Basque Country distributed through it and its prices. The results show that the length-of-stay (LOS) parameter of the queries to the website is key to obtaining a representative sample of the accommodation offered through this channel. A sampling method based on the representative values of LOS inferred from a data sample is proposed. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",alternative accommodation market; destination management; dynamic pricing; Internet distribution channel; room/apartment prices
Nguyen D.,The university in a world of digital technologies: Tensions and challenges,2018,"This paper discusses the challenges and tensions in the relationship between the university as a social institution and the world of digital technologies in which it finds itself, from the perspective of an early-career academic in her late 20s. It argues that problems abound in the university's tendency to adopt non-educational digital technologies for educational purposes in the name of student engagement, and that this approach should be avoided. It also argues that, faced with an uncertain future of job automation and gig economy, universities should move away from the ‘work-ready’ graduate model. Instead, it should empower its students with the capacity to flexibly reprogram their skillsets for the changing nature of work, and play an active role in envisioning new (non)work realities by engaging students in the transformation of their education. © 2018",Digital education; Digital university; Future of work; Future skills; Social media

Basu K.,The rise of Trump and an agenda for regulatory reform,2018,"The arrival of Trump in the White House does not augur well for the long-run prospects of the US economy. The protectionism that is gathering steam under his presidency may yield some short-term gains, but at the detriment of the long-run. Examining the discontent among ordinary voters that brought Trump to power, this paper argues that this should be treated as an opportunity for a major regulatory reform. With the advance of digital technology, we have increasing returns to scale, and that, in turn, is making our antitrust laws backfire and hurt the well-being of ordinary people, thereby sowing discontent. The paper builds a simple model to illustrate this and makes the case for revoking the older antitrust laws and replacing them with some simple profit-sharing rules at the level of the firm, and the economy. © 2018 The Society for Policy Modeling",Antitrust law; Increasing returns; Price discrimination; Profit sharing; Protectionism
"Azzam M., Sami N., Khalil T.",The journey to Egypt's digital transformation,2018,"Purpose of the paper: The purpose of the paper is to provide a framework that can be used by Government of Egypt (GoE) to shape the future, create the desired abundance digital economy, and build a digitally competitive nation.

Orlando USA, International Association for Management of Technology (IAMOT). Design/Methodology/Approach: The approach used in the paper is based on thorough analysis of the reports issued by international institutions and literature in the areas of future governments and digital transformation, desk research, and interviews with key personnel in the government, Business Representative Organizations (BROs), and private sector, in addition to youth, startups and entrepreneurs. Findings: The paper outlines the major drivers that are shaping the future and their effects, the outlook of the future government and its function, and the role of Management of Technology (MOT) in this regards. This is towards developing a framework. A framework that aims at ensuring a sustainable economic growth in Egypt, which will be based on a public policy that anticipates the future, as well as understands how to handle the nature and the size of the ongoing change in a proper and innovative manner. A public policy that advances economic, technological innovation and trade systems. This is for matching the 21stcentury's challenges and opportunities, and on the other hand, helping the nation to be capable to deal with such fluid environment and unprecedented disruptive models, towards prosperity and abundance digital economy. Research limitations/implications: The study has the limitation that the empirical part is based on the international models in the domain of the digital transformation. More empirical research and studies should be conducted within the local context. This is for validating the findings and developing implementation programs for achieving the ultimate goal of building a competitive ""Digital Egypt"". Practical implications: The proposed framework will act as a guiding instrument for senior officials, policymakers, and business leaders for planning and executing effective and efficient digital transformation programs on both social and economic levels, while fostering innovation, attracting investment and creating jobs. Originality/value of the paper: The paper provides a holistic outlook for senior officials, policymakers, and business leaders. This is for assisting them to have the big picture in mind, while developing and implementing the digital transformation programs that have a sound impact from the social and economic perspectives.

"Lisboa E., Godinho R.S., Leão Da Silva L.",Fintechs in Brazil: Opportunities or threats?,2018,"Defined as companies that offer financial services that differentiate themselves by the facilities provided by the technology and, indeed, by the Internet fintechs have reached a prominent role in the Brazilian economic scenario. To accompany the development and advancement of new means of access and service, the banks have sought the adoption of friendly and efficient digital platforms so that they can contain the advances of fintechs. Given this situation, the study aims to identify how fintechs are characterized as opportunities and threats for large financial institutions in Brazil. In order to understand and analyze the aspects related to fintechs, the research approaches topics that are aligned to the theme, such as the current context of the economy, the National Financial System and the scenario of start-ups in Brazil. This study has a descriptive and qualitative character, in which the data were collected from interviews with those responsible for financial institutions. The research allowed to identify that there is the acceptance by the great institutions to apply this fintechs model. It was also observed that there is a need to regulate the sector so that it can grow with more freedom and thus be able to add to the country this technological wealth, but it analyzes the need to be less bureaucratic like the financial institutions that operate in the market. The study presented the limitations of a few cases, in which it was not possible to interview more management in others companies which are involved in some way with the innovations of the organization. From this situation, it is suggested that other studies are carried out in order to cover other interesting points that concern the fintechs business model. The study allowed us to understand how large companies already established in the financial market identify fintechs and their business models. Identifying opportunities, threats and how this understanding permits the fintechs to prepare for a competitive market, and for large companies to understand how this model can be characterized as an ally. In relation to the originality, several studies have been developed in the scope of financial market. However, when researching in scientific databases, little is explored about fintechs and the perception of its business model by other players in the sector. © 2018 Towards Sustainable Technologies and Innovation - Proceedings of the 27th Annual Conference of the International Association for Management of Technology, IAMOT 2018.

Nowadays, mostly business organization, small or big, wishes valuable and accurate information in decision-making process. Big data can help SMEs to anticipate their target audience and customer preferences and needs. Simply, there is a dire necessity for SMEs to seriously consider big data adoption. This study focusses on SMEs due to the fact that SMEs are backbone of any economy and have ability and flexibility for quicker adaptation to changes towards productivity. The big data holds different contentious issues such as; suitable computing infrastructure for storage, processing and producing functional information from it, and security and privacy issues.

"Khan W., Selamat S.A.M., Ramachandran M.",Appraisal of transactional data through visualisation for SMEs,2018,"E-commerce has proven to play a pivotal role in the economy growth. One of the key e-commerce functions is the collection of the vast amount of useful transactional data to help businesses in understanding their consumers' behaviour. With the rapid and large volume of data collected, it is posing a great challenge for businesses to analyse the data on a day-to-day basis. The key issue is not in the generation or collection of data; it is in the manipulation of the collected data to churn out new and insightful information. Information visualisation is an effective tool in converting data into interactive interfaces to unearth hidden trends. It provides a platform to explore the data in a more rapid and intuitive approach. There are several existing techniques to analyse multidimensional data. This chapter seeks to introduce a comprehensive and robust visualisation model and framework for adoption. The visualisation model consists of four major layers, which include acquisition and data analysis, data representation, user and computer interaction, and result storage. © 2018 by IGI Global.

Sovbetov Y.,Impact of Digital Economy on Female Employment: Evidence from Turkey,2018,"This paper investigates impact of e-economic activities on female employment rates in Turkey over 1994–2016. The analysis unveils three major findings. First, 80.74% of variations in female employment are accounted by e-commerce and control variables. Second, Autoregressive Distributed Lag analysis documents that these series (female employment, e-commerce and control variables) are cointegrated, thus, a unit increase in per credit card e-commerce transactions leads the female employment rate to grow by 0.13 units in long-run at 1% significance level, whereas a percentage increase in internet penetration rate in Turkey augments the rates by 0.33%. Third, error-correction model analysis refers that the system quickly corrects its previous period disequilibrium converging at a speed of 75.43%, and also documents that the lags of per credit card e-commerce jointly have short-run impact on female employment rates. Thus, the study concludes that developing e-commerce incentivizing policies might help to empower women in Turkey significantly. © 2018, © 2018 Korea International Economic Association.",ARDL bound test; cointegration; digitalization; e-commerce; Female employment; job creation
"Eberlein E., Gerhart C.",A multiple-curve Lévy forward rate model in a two-price economy,2018,"An advanced Heath–Jarrow–Morton forward rate model driven by time-inhomogeneous Lévy processes is presented which is able to handle the recent development to multiple curves and negative interest rates. It is also able to exploit bid and ask price data. In this approach in order to model spreads between curves for different tenors, credit as well as liquidity risk is taken into account. Deterministic conditions are derived to ensure the positivity of spreads and thus the monotonicity of the curves for the various tenors. Valuation formulas for standard interest rate derivatives such as caps, floors, swaptions and digital options are established. These formulas can be evaluated numerically very fast using Fourier-based valuation methods. In order to exploit bid and ask prices we develop this approach in the context of a two-price economy. Explicit formulas for bid as well as ask prices of the derivatives are stated. A specific model framework based on normal inverse Gaussian and Gamma processes is proposed which allows for calibration to market data. Calibration results are presented based on multiple-curve bootstrapping and cap market quotes. We use data from September 2013 as well as September 2016. The latter is of particular interest since rates were deep in negative territory at that time. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Calibration; HJM; Interest rate derivatives; Monotonicity of curves; Multiple-curve bootstrapping; Multiple-curve model; Negative interest rates; Time-inhomogeneous Lévy processes; Two-price theory
"Schultz D.E., Jain V.",Discovering India's three levels of luxury consumption: An exploratory research to find a conceptual framework,2018,"Luxury marketing research has moved from functional product attributes to a ‘democratized’ view in emerging economies. This seems to be based on the development of interactive and digital communications. Luxury research studies have historically focused on the brand's and marketer's perspectives. Thus, little attention has been given to the consumer's view of what we consider to be the individual drivers, i.e., the ‘inner and outer self’ and how that impacts luxury consumption. This paper presents a framework of luxury and self, using concepts such as interdependent or outer, independent or inner, and a new concept of ‘digital self’. These appear as three levels of luxury consumption, i.e., conspicuous, individual, and interactive. The interdependent self is influenced by the external motives and leads to conspicuous luxury behavior. Individual self is affected by internal motives and thus influences individual luxury consumption. Digital self affects the networks of motive and relationships and thereby impacts interactive luxury consumption and behavior. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",India; levels of luxury consumption; purchase motives; qualitative studies; self-concept of consumers
"Holland C.P., Gutiérrez-Leefmans M.",A Taxonomy of SME E-Commerce Platforms Derived from a Market-Level Analysis,2018,"Small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) constitute a large and important sector of the U.S. and U.K. economies and e-commerce platforms have evolved that are designed specifically to help small business owners and entrepreneurs. Despite the popularity and importance of these digital platforms, there is a paucity of research in this area. This article contributes to theory by being the first study to map out the competitive landscape of SME e-commerce platforms in two markets using a theoretical framework and analysis that is based on business model and strategic group theories. In total, 144 platforms were analyzed using an online panel data methodology, which identified 32 leading SME e-commerce platforms in the UK and United States. These leading platforms were analyzed at the market level using cluster analysis based on strategic group theory and website content analysis. A taxonomy is proposed based on theoretical constructs derived from business model theory: value proposition, Web 2.0 sophistication, and revenue model. Five distinctive strategic groups are identified: information laggards, basic networking, advanced networking, advanced networking mature, and social media markets. The study further outlines managerial implications for SMEs, SME e-commerce platform providers, and external sponsors of the platforms—predominantly government organizations and banks.

"Nipo D.T.A., Bujang I., Hassan H.",Global digital divide: Reassessing the evidence behind ICT and its contribution to trade among the ICT haves and have-nots In developing economies,2018,"With regard to the trade sector, information and communication technology (ICT) is seen as a tool that not only helps to promote productivity, but also improve trade competitiveness. Previous studies have shown significant and positive contributions of ICT to trade, however such evidence may not necessarily be true for countries that have relatively lower level of ICT uptake, particularly those at the undesirable end of digital divide. This paper assesses the impact of ICT on trade measured in terms of merchandise and services, on 42 upper middle income countries (ICT haves) and 21 low income countries (ICT have-nots), separately, from 2007 to 2014. Using panel OLS and Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimation methods, findings revealed that ICT has no significant impact on either type of trade in low income countries, whereas more advanced forms of ICT namely, mobile cellular and the Internet emerge significant for upper middle income countries. These results suggest that level of ICT may still be at infancy in low income countries, while the ICT-enabled trade in upper middle income countries is already showing increased merchandise trade and service trade from the use of modern technologies. © 2017, Academy of Business and Retail Management Research.",Developing economies; Digital divide; ICT

"Malgieri G., Custers B.",Pricing privacy – the right to know the value of your personal data,2018,"The commodification of digital identities is an emerging reality in the data-driven economy. Personal data of individuals represent monetary value in the data-driven economy and are often considered a counter performance for “free” digital services or for discounts for online products and services. Furthermore, customer data and profiling algorithms are already considered a business asset and protected through trade secrets. At the same time, individuals do not seem to be fully aware of the monetary value of their personal data and tend to underestimate their economic power within the data-driven economy and to passively succumb to the propertization of their digital identity. An effort that can increase awareness of consumers/users on their own personal information could be making them aware of the monetary value of their personal data. In other words, if individuals are shown the “price” of their personal data, they can acquire higher awareness about their power in the digital market and thus be effectively empowered for the protection of their information privacy. This paper analyzes whether consumers/users should have a right to know the value of their personal data. After analyzing how EU legislation is already developing in the direction of propertization and monetization of personal data, different models for quantifying the value of personal data are investigated. These models are discussed, not to determine the actual prices of personal data, but to show that the monetary value of personal data can be quantified, a conditio-sine-qua-non for the right to know the value of your personal data. Next, active choice models, in which users are offered the option to pay for online services, either with their personal data or with money, are discussed. It is concluded, however, that these models are incompatible with EU data protection law. Finally, practical, moral and cognitive problems of pricing privacy are discussed as an introduction to further research. We conclude that such research is needed to see to which extent these problems can be solved or mitigated. Only then, it can be determined whether the benefits of introducing a right to know the value of your personal data outweigh the problems and hurdles related to it. © 2018 Gianclaudio Malgieri",Big data; Data economy; Data subject rights; Digital identities; Personal data; Privacy
"De Hert P., Papakonstantinou V., Malgieri G., Beslay L., Sanchez I.",The right to data portability in the GDPR: Towards user-centric interoperability of digital services,2018,"The right to data portability is one of the most important novelties within the EU General Data Protection Regulation, both in terms of warranting control rights to data subjects and in terms of being found at the intersection between data protection and other fields of law (competition law, intellectual property, consumer protection, etc.). It constitutes, thus, a valuable case of development and diffusion of effective user-centric privacy enhancing technologies and a first tool to allow individuals to enjoy the immaterial wealth of their personal data in the data economy. Indeed, a free portability of personal data from one controller to another can be a strong tool for data subjects in order to foster competition of digital services and interoperability of platforms and in order to enhance controllership of individuals on their own data. However, the adopted formulation of the right to data portability in the GDPR could benefit from further clarification: several interpretations are possible, particularly with regard to the object of the right and its interrelation with other rights, potentially leading to additional challenges within its technical implementation. The aim of this article is to propose a first systematic interpretation of this new right, by suggesting a pragmatic and extensive approach, particularly taking advantage as much as possible of the interrelationship that this new legal provision can have with regard to the Digital Single Market and the fundamental rights of digital users. In sum, the right to data portability can be approximated under two different perspectives: the minimalist approach (the adieu scenario) and the empowering approach (the fusing scenario), which the authors consider highly preferable. © 2018 Paul De Hert, Vagelis Papakonstantinou, Gianclaudio Malgieri, Laurent Beslay, Ignacio Sanchez",EU data protection; EU General Data Protection Regulation; Right to data portability

"Bartolini C., Santos C., Ullrich C.",Property and the cloud,2018,"Data is a modern form of wealth in the digital world, and massive amounts of data circulate in cloud environments. While this enormously facilitates the sharing of information, both for personal and professional purposes, it also introduces some critical problems concerning the ownership of the information. Data is an intangible good that is stored in large data warehouses, where the hardware architectures and software programs running the cloud services coexist with the data of many users. This context calls for a twofold protection: on one side, the cloud is made up of hardware and software that constitute the business assets of the service provider (property of the cloud); on the other side, there is a definite need to ensure that users retain control over their data (property in the cloud). The law grants protection to both sides under several perspectives, but the result is a complex mix of interwoven regimes, further complicated by the intrinsically international nature of cloud computing that clashes with the typical diversity of national laws. As the business model based on cloud computing grows, public bodies, and in particular the European Union, are striving to find solutions to properly regulate the future economy, either by introducing new laws, or by finding the best ways to apply existing principles. © 2018 Cesare Bartolini, Cristiana Santos & Carsten Ullrich",Cloud computing; Contractual terms; Copyright; Data protection; Dispute resolution; Intellectual property; Patents; Property; Trade secret

"Agarwal J., Wu T.",Emerging issues in global marketing: A shifting paradigm,2018,"This book examines emerging theories, frameworks, and applications of global marketing for the 21st century. It highlights how global marketing is changing in a globalized and digital economy that is fast increasing in complexity and uncertainty. The traditional approach to global marketing is no longer sufficient to address the emerging issues in global markets. Global companies need to challenge traditional assumptions in global marketing in an era of shifting political, cultural, economic, and technological changes. They need to take a fresh look at the contemporary threats and opportunities in markets, institutions, and technology and how they affect entry and expansion strategies through careful re-calibration of the marketing-mix. This book offers new insights for global marketing that addresses these issues. This book should be an ideal resource to both academic scholars and reflective practitioners globally such as CEOs and chief marketing officers as well as government officials and policy makers interested in formulating strategies/policies for global marketing activities in the face of a globalized and digitized economy.

The authors present the latest insight on the impact of phenomena such as cross-border e-commerce and digital markets, and they discuss new tools for political risk assessment, international branding and more broadly the reconfiguring of marketing-mix strategies - A powerful reminder that the new global market remains a rugged landscape. Alain Verbeke, McCaig Research Chair in Management and Editor-in-Chief Journal of International Business Studies, University of Calgary, Canada. Emerging trends in institutions, markets, and societies, along with new technological advances, are redefining the scope and strategy in global marketing. Professors Agarwal and Wu have assembled a remarkable collection of cutting-edge topics and issues that capture the shifting paradigm and contemporary developments in the global marketing field. This is an informative and timely resource that makes a valuable contribution, useful for both scholars and business practitioners of global marketing. Constantine S. Katsikeas, Arnold Ziff Endowed Research Chair in Marketing & International Management, Editor-in-Chief Journal of International Marketing, University of Leeds, UK. This book presents new and cutting-edge thinking at a time when the traditional views of international marketing need to be scrapped. Convergence forces are creating new opportunities as well as threats on a daily basis, and marketing practitioners as well as scholars must be forewarned as well as forearmed on how to deal with these changes. The real growth is coming from the emerging nations, and the theories that provided sufficient insights ten years ago have been completely outmoded by the ever-accelerating rate of innovation and technological change as well as the pressures to address the needs of all of the firm's relevant stakeholders. The strategic insights provided here are absolutely invaluable. Don't miss an opportunity to read this book!! John B.

End-to-end technologies including ""Big Data"", ""New Production Technologies"", ""Quantum Technologies"", ""Technologies of Virtual and Augmented Realities"", the possibilities of their application in various sectors of the national economy were singled out and analyzed. The role of end-to-end technologies in the development of the Russian economy and promotion of innovative activities of companies was studied. A comparative analysis of the main indicators of informatization of the society of Russia and some leading foreign countries for the period of 2005-2015 was carried out. The conclusions were made about an insufficient use of the Internet in Russia, primarily in rural areas, which hindered the social progress of Russian society. The leading role of digital (information) technologies in solving social problems, including education, social services and healthcare, was defined. The necessity of development of electronic services in the sphere of education and health was proved.

An information security system is a set of corporate rules, standards of work and procedures for ensuring information security formed based on the audit of the company's information system, and the analysis of existing security risks in accordance with requirements of the regulatory documents of the Russian Federation and the provisions of the standards in the field of information security. It is especially important for Russian companies actively interacting with foreign partners. In addressing the problem of information security, the development of the company's unified information security policy occupies a leading place; therefore, this article will be devoted to consideration of these issues. The authors of the present study proceed from the objective-subjective predetermination of any phenomena and processes of the external world. In this format, the study is based on general scientific methods: systematic analysis and generalization of normative and practical materials; formal and dialectical logic: analysis, synthesis, induction, deduction, hypotheses, analogies; and special methods of legal research: comparative-legal and historical-legal, system analysis and interpretation of legal norms. Based on the analysis, the following conclusions have been made: currently, the most important direction of the national economy development is the protection of vital human and social interests, the key element of which is information security. This study represents the development of a scientific overview of the modern ways to ensure information security in both applied and legal contexts. This article underlines and examines the problems and economic legal features of ensuring information security in Russia.

"Cheng M., Foley C.",The sharing economy and digital discrimination: The case of Airbnb,2018,Digital discrimination has become a buzz word following the recent reports of racial and other discrimination associated with Airbnb. This issue is perceived to pose serious concerns with the rapid growth of the sharing economy. This research derives insights into digital discrimination through the lens of a series of online newspaper comments made in response to an article reporting Airbnb's new anti-discrimination policy. The data were analysed by using text-mining and co-stakeholder analysis. The visualized network and each stakeholder's surrounding discourse reveal that digital discrimination contains multiple layers and meaning constructions. This paper provides a starting point for tourism and hospitality researchers to contribute to the thinking around the digital discrimination with the rapid growth of the sharing economy. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd,Airbnb; Co-stakeholder analysis; Digital discrimination; News comments; Text mining

The Operational Program Digital Poland (OPDP) is one of the programs financed from public funds, which is directly targeted at the development of the digital economy in Poland. At the end of 2017, the implementation of the program is at the halfway point, which gives the premise to reflect on the degree of convergence of goals and program implementation with the trends of digital transformation. The research methodology is based on the analysis of secondary sources and participant observation. The results of the analysis show that the results of actions undertaken under the OPDP in principle indirectly contribute to the progressing trend of digitization of the Polish economy. The structure of expenditures under the OPDP testifies to the relative shallow rooting of the digital transformation or, more broadly, the digital economy in Poland. © 2018 Faculty of Management, Warsaw University of Technology.",digital transformation; Operational Program Digital Poland; Poland; Public structural expenditure

Tassi P.,Media: From the contact economy to the attention economy,2018,"The question of the attention paid to content, a message or other information has long been raised in an environment that is not yet at the limits of saturation. This was a question even in bygone eras when the works of Michael Goldhaber, Yves Citton, Dominique Boullier and others advanced the study of attention in the context of hyperconnectivity. Today, the media economy is still dominated by the notion of contact with media, media devices, specific content, expressed by the number of readers, listeners, viewers and Web surfers, and the supreme indicator: the Gross Rating Point. Yet the GRP has existed for several decades, having emerged at a time when print media dominated, television channels and radio stations were far fewer in number, and the Internet had not even been invented. Thus, the media economy has been built on contacts with content, including that of an advertising nature. Digital convergence and the advent of Internet content by and for the general public have led to a situation of constant solicitation from many sources. This does not eliminate the notion of contact (or touchpoint), which must be considered a necessary condition, to be supplemented by the interest or attention garnered by such contact. This article addresses the media ecosystem in France, first describing its existing economy based on contact counts and then discussing emergent changes related to content digitization and the many solicitations received by individuals, making it necessary to consider the attention paid to any given content, as illustrated by some initial measurement experiments. Conclusions are drawn as to a possible transition from the still nascent attention economy to an emotion economy. © 2018 École des Hautes Études Commerciales (HEC), Montréal.",Attention; Audience measure; Contact; Emotion; Media
"Cardullo P., Kitchin R., Di Feliciantonio C.",Living labs and vacancy in the neoliberal city,2018,"This paper evaluates smart city (SC) initiatives in the context of re-using vacant property, focusing on the role of living labs (LL). LL utilise Lo-Fi technologies to foster local digital innovation and support community-focused civic hacking, running various kinds of workshops and engaging with local citizens to co-create digital interventions and apps aimed at 'solving’ local issues. Five approaches to LL are outlined and discussed in relation to vacancy and gentrification: pop-up initiatives, university-led activities, community organised venues/activities, citizen sensing and crowdsourcing, and tech-led regeneration initiatives. Notwithstanding the potential for generating temporary and independent spaces for transferring digital competences and increasing citizens' participation in the SC, we argue LL foster largely a form of participation framed within a model of civic stewardship for 'smart citizens’. While presented as horizontal, open, and participative, LL and civic hacking are rooted often in pragmatic and paternalistic discourses and practices related to the production of a creative economy and a technocratic version of SC. As such, by encouraging a particular kind of re-use of vacant space, LLs are used actively to bolster the Smart City discourse, as part of the more general neoliberalization of urban political economy. We discuss these approaches and issues generally, drawing on previous fieldwork and with respect to a case study of Dublin, Ireland. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",

"Lambrecht A., Tucker C., Wiertz C.",Advertising to early trend propagators: Evidence from twitter,2018,"In the digital economy, influencing and controlling the spread of information is a key concern for firms. One way firms try to achieve this is to target firmcommunications to consumers who embrace and propagate the spread of new information on emerging and ""trending"" topics on social media. However, little is known about whether early trend propagators are indeed responsive to firm-sponsored messages. To explore whether early propagators of trending topics respond to advertising messages, we use data from two field tests conducted by a charity and an emerging fashion firm on the microblogging service Twitter. On Twitter, ""promoted tweets"" allow advertisers to target individuals based on the content of their recent postings. Twitter continuously identifies in real time which topics are newly popular among Twitter users. In the field tests, we collaborated with a charity and a fashion firmto target ads at consumers who embraced a Twitter trend early in its life cycle by posting about it, and compared their behavior to that of consumers who posted about the same topic later on. Throughout both field tests, we consistently find that early propagators of trends are less responsive to advertising than consumers who embrace trends later. © 2018 INFORMS.",Internet; Online advertising; Targeting; Twitter; User-generated content
Salmony M.,Rethinking digital identity,2018,"Massive cyber breaches and identity frauds are daily news. Users experience endless frustration with countless passwords and registration procedures. Governments suffer from poor online acceptance and merchants experience high fraud costs despite massive IT investments. Perhaps it is time to rethink the topic of identity. This paper argues that we should move from verifying the full ‘iden-tity’ of a person or company to very specific ‘attri-bute verification’. This should be done not only for people and companies but also for devices, apps, bots and more.The paper advocates the use of intelligent data-driven authentication and a shift away from the current dependence on government-issued documents, faxes/utility bills, user ID/passwords and rigid two-factor procedures. It argues that the future should be based upon pseudonyms rather than full identification and will describe the very few occasions when full anonymisation is actually necessary. The paper proposes a federated model that connects the many current silos of organisations providing attributes with the many organisations that wish to use them, employing an open four-corner model instead of today’s point-to-point interconnections. Finally, it provides arguments why banks could and maybe should play a more active role in this space, notably to realise benefits for all in the emerging Open Banking and platform economy. © Henry Stewart Publications, 1750-1806.",Attribute verification; Authentication; Bank-id; Eidas; Four-corner model; Gdpr; Identity; Privacy; Pseudonymity
"Han H., Hawken S.",Introduction: Innovation and identity in next-generation smart cities,2018,"Cultural nuance, human behaviour and social identity require greater attention within the emerging smart city phenomenon. This special issue critically considers identity and urban culture as central to the smart city challenge. Current discourse on smart cities is obsessed with technological capability and development. Global rankings reduce cities to a one-dimensional business model and series of metrics. If the term ‘smart city’ is to have any enduring value, technology must be used to develop a city's unique cultural identity and quality of life for the future. The editorial reviews emerging research on the cultural dimensions of urban innovation and smart cities and places the six special issue papers within a theoretical context. Each paper critiques smart city theories in relation to the practical challenge of enhancing urban identity, quality and value at a range of scales and geographic contexts. Three main themes are used to frame the debate on smart cities and urban innovation: 1) local development histories, 2) face-to-face relationships and 3) local community scales. Each of these themes is lacking in current smart city approaches and requires innovative approaches to integrate into the smart city of tomorrow. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Big data; Data economy; Digital identity; Informational footprints; Smart cities; Urban innovation
"Michelini L., Principato L., Iasevoli G.",Understanding Food Sharing Models to Tackle Sustainability Challenges,2018,"The current global scene is characterized by a huge paradox: on one side, there is the scourge of poverty, on the other, 1.3 billion tonnes of food is wasted around the world every year. To address these problems, alternative distribution formats aimed at reducing food waste - and generating a positive social impact - are emerging, particularly food banks and social supermarkets. Recently, opportunities created by digital technology and the phenomenon of the sharing economy have boosted the increasing number of web platforms and food sharing apps that are being developed by existing organizations or by new entities that work exclusively online. The main aim of this research is to highlight – following an overview of existing food sharing models - how alternative distribution systems change in response to digitalization, and how the value propositions they claim change in the online context. A hierarchical cluster analysis based on a sample of 52 food sharing cases was carried out. Three categories of models have emerged: - the “sharing for money” model, which is primarily a B2C for-profit model to reduce waste and, at the same time, generate revenue; - the “sharing for charity” model in which food is collected and given to non-profit organizations; - the “sharing for the community” model which is a P2P model where food is shared amongst consumers. By way of conclusion we suggest that food bank seems to be replicated online in the same way in the online context (the “sharing for charity” model). However the model of the social supermarket does not seems to be replicated in the same way in the digital context, but changes towards a more profit oriented approach (the “sharing for money” model). Additionally, in the digital scenario, a new model emerges: the “sharing for the community”. Finally, the study highlights some preliminary evidences on the effects of the new forms of sharing on social inequality. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

Abdullahi R.B.,"Volunteerism in urban development the case of non-cash, non-digital crowdfunding growth in Nigeria",2018,"Crowdfunding is a digital-based tool for mobilizing cash for various projects contributing to urban development. This chapter argues that for societies with low digital penetration and less cash but with huge human resources and high physical interaction, crowdfunding should be used as tool for mobilizing human capital for urban development. In this sense, volunteering is a form of crowdfunding. This chapter explores the influence of volunteers in developing and maintaining their urban communities. As an activity aimed at promoting the welfare of other individuals or groups through services or cash transfers, volunteerism is a useful tool for emerging economies to fill the gap between their development resource demand and availability. Review of few relevant concepts and experiences reveal the potential contributions of paid and unpaid volunteers in Africa with a focus on the efforts to shift the Nigerian economy from an oil-based to an urban-based. © 2018, IGI Global.

This paper provides answers to this research query by applying routine activity theory and the theory of reasoned action. The paper’s study analyses consumers’ role as possible offenders that can have the opportunity to engage in online software piracy as part of their routine online activities. Although it is problematic to measure the exact magnitude of the negative impact on the US economy, as stated by the Government Accountability Office it is sizeable. After analysing the conceptual model using a US national consumer sample of over 700 consumers, results show the influence of proximity to motivated offenders, target suitability, and capable guardianship on consumers’ attitudes and perceived subjective norms towards online software piracy, as well as their intentions to engage in this illegal behaviour on the Internet. By integrating routine activity theory, a criminology theory with the theory of reasoned action from psychology and analysing a widespread online software piracy phenomenon, several academic and practical contributions are made. © 2018 Westburn Publishers Ltd.",digital copyright; Online software piracy; peer-to-peer sharing; routine activity theory; theory of reasoned action

Vela Velupillai K.,"The epistemology of simulation, computation, and dynamics in economics",2018,"In this chapter the spirit of William Petty is the driving force, but it is given new theoret- ical foundations, mainly as a result of developments in the mathematic underpinnings of the tremendous developments in the potentials of computing, especially using digital technology. Computation and simulation have always played a role in economics, whether it be pure economic theory or any variant of applied economics. This tradition can be traced to the vision of Petty, the founding father of political economy as political arithmetic. A running theme is that, increasingly, the development of economic theory seems to go hand in hand with advances in the theory and practice of computing, which is, in turn, a catalyst for the move away from overreliance on any kind of mathematics for the formalization of economic entities that is inconsistent with the mathematical, philosophical, and epistemological foundations of the digital computer. © Oxford University Press 2018.

The pricing of such intangibles is widely used to shift profits to low-tax countries. We analyze the implications of different OECD methods to regulate transfer pricing and the role of a source tax on royalty payments for abusive transfer pricing. First, we show that under the traditional transfer pricing methods mispricing of royalty payments does not affect investment behavior. In contrast, the Transactional Profit Split Method that is promoted by the OECD for evaluating firms in the digital economy triggers higher investment in order to facilitate higher profit shifting. Second, royalty taxation is effective in reducing (such) abusive profit shifting, but always reduces investment. Third, a royalty tax rate below the corporate tax rate leads to overinvestment in a tax system with allowance for corporate equity (ACE). © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",
Akram M.S.,Drivers and barriers to online shopping in a newly digitalized society,2018,"Despite the massive penetration of internet in the developed and the developing world, e-commerce is still struggling in most of the developing and emerging economies. In this context, this study investigates why the customers, in developing countries, do not prefer online shopping for apparel despite the several benefits such as convenience, control, variety and enjoyment being offered by this mode of shopping. Moreover, the study assesses the boundary conditions under which consumers' perceived risk diminishes online shopping benefits. With data from prospective online customers in an emerging economy, the proposed concept is tested using SmartPLS 3.0 based SEM approach. The results indicate a significant positive effect of online shopping benefits on consumers' purchase intention for online shopping. In addition, the relationship between online shopping benefits and purchase intention is contingent on the consumers' level of perceived risk in the digital environment.

"Deakin M., Reid A.",Smart cities: Under-gridding the sustainability of city-districts as energy efficient-low carbon zones,2018,"This paper reviews the literature on smart cities. Offering a critical synthesis of the material, it advances a Triple Helix inspired account of smart cities as future internet-based developments. In particular, as future internet-based developments covering the digital infrastructures, data management systems, renewable energies and cloud computing of a regional innovation in the Internet of Things (IoT). More specifically, as a regional innovation in the IoT that covers the morphology of urban extensions, infill and mass retrofits, which smart cities call for the development of. Focusing on the metrics of mass retrofit proposals, the paper also serves to demonstrate how the urban morphology of such regional innovations matter in the sense they tell us that being aware of the considerable energy savings and CO2 reductions, which IoTs offer cities to be smart, is not enough. Not enough, because without knowing whether the costs and benefits under-gridding the sustainability of city-districts are shared equally, it is impossible to say if the 65% energy saving and 78% reduction in CO2, attributed to the data collection, information processing and smart (micro) grids of mass retrofits is socially just. The paper suggests that in order to verify this, it is necessary for smart cities to first baseline the social-demographic structure of retrofit proposals. Then draw upon the environmental profile this evaluation generates to assess whether the regional innovation creates the wealth needed to under-grid the sustainability of city-districts. Under-grid the sustainability of city-districts as the energy efficient-low carbon zones of an inclusive growth strategy seen to be socially just. Seen to be socially just, because the costs and benefits underlying the 1.5 ha ecological footprint that surfaces from this regional innovation are equally appropriated as the proceeds of a wealth creation, which contributes to the resilience of city-districts as energy efficient-low carbon zones.

"Dong F., Yu B., Hadachin T., Dai Y., Wang Y., Zhang S., Long R.",Drivers of carbon emission intensity change in China,2018,"Carbon emissions per unit of GDP (also called carbon emission intensity, CEI) can be utilized to measure regional carbon emission performance. In this study, structural decomposition analysis (SDA) and quantile regression are employed to investigate the factors that drive changes in CEI in China. Based on input-output SDA, CEI in China during 1992–2012 is decomposed from the perspectives of the total economy and economic sectors. The results specify that the industrial sector is the key sector for energy conservation and emission reduction. Energy efficiency contributes the most to CEI reduction, whereas input structure, final demand structure, and final product structure are factors that hinder reductions. Furthermore, energy mix, technical progress, industrialization index, and final consumption rate are introduced as proxy variables. To reveal the changes of influencing factors with CEI increasing, the effects of these proxy variables on CEI are explored by quantile regression with panel data of 30 provinces from 1999 to 2014. The results indicate that energy mix, industrialization index, and final consumption rate have positive effects on CEI. As CEI increases, the effect of energy mix increases gradually, whereas the effect of industrialization index tends to decrease, and the effect of final consumption rate increases initially and then decreases. Technical progress and urbanization are both effective in reducing CEI. With CEI increasing, the negative effect of technical progress presents a trend of decrease, then increase. Conversely, the negative effect of urbanization is through the process of increase, then decrease. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Carbon emission intensity; China; Quantile regression; SDA

An empirical comparison of two peer-to-peer goods-sharing platforms,2018,"Sustainable business models are intended to create economic value while benefitting the environment and society. Their wider adoption and diffusion is necessary to tackle pressing societal problems. How they are implemented and what determines their success (or lack thereof) in the market is not yet well understood, however, and deserves further exploration. To help fill the gap in knowledge, this study examines an emerging and innovative type of sustainable business model based on the peer-to-peer (P2P) sharing of underutilised assets facilitated by digital platforms. Its aim is to identify possible reasons for their commercial success or failure. In particular, the study investigates the values of users of a successful P2P goods-sharing platform and to what extent they differ from values of users of a comparable, yet unsuccessful, platform. Previous research on a UK-based online marketplace, Ecomodo, measured people's motivations for joining and the value priorities of users using Schwartz's Portrait Value Questionnaire. Results were compared with data from a representative sample of the UK population and used to explain the platform's low market uptake. The same study is here replicated with members of Peerby, an online marketplace where people rent, lend and borrow their possessions with each other. The analysis shows similar value priorities and orientation in Ecomodo and Peerby respondents, which suggests that the failure of the former platform and the success of the latter may be more directly attributed to differences in their business model design and execution than the types of user. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Market acceptance; P2P sharing platforms; Sharing economy; Sustainable business models; Values

These are well aligned with new research questions related to the digital economy, Industry 4.0, the impact of the millennial generation as consumers, social media, 3D printing, etc. However, we also explore how it is the worst of times, focusing on the challenges and problems that plague empirical OSM research. Our goal is to show how OSM researchers can learn from the worst of times, in order to be poised to take advantage of the best of times. We introduce the research diamond as a vehicle for emphasising the importance of a balanced research perspective that treats the research problem, theory, data collection and data analysis as equally important, requiring alignment between them. By learning and addressing the issues in this period of the best of times and the worst of times, we can take advantage of the opportunities facing our field to generate research that is balanced, insightful, rigorous, relevant, impactful and interesting. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",assessment of research; behavioral operations management; big data; economics; empirical study; future trends and developments; Industry 4.0; Operations management; supply chain management; theory development
"Kazan E., Tan C.-W., Lim E.T.K., Sørensen C., Damsgaard J.",Disentangling Digital Platform Competition: The Case of UK Mobile Payment Platforms,2018,"Digital platforms confer competitive advantage through superior architectural configurations. There is, however, still a dearth of research that sheds light on the competitive attributes that define platform competition from an architectural standpoint. To disentangle platform competition, we opted for the mobile payment market in the United Kingdom as our empirical setting. By conceptualizing digital platforms as layered modular architectures and embracing the theoretical lens of strategic groups, this study supplements prior research by deriving a taxonomy of platform profiles that is grounded on the strategic dimensions of value creation and value delivery architectures. We discover that mobile payment platforms could be delineated based on: (1) whether they are integrative or integratable on their value creation architecture; and (2) whether they have direct, indirect, or open access on their value delivery architecture. The preceding attributes of value creation architecture and value delivery architecture aided us in identifying six profiles associated with mobile payment platforms, which in turn led us to advance three competitive strategies that could be pursued by digital platforms in network economies.

Thussu D.,A new global communication order for a multipolar world,2018,"In an increasingly digitised and globalised 24/7 multi-media age, the one-way vertical flow of media and communication–from the West to the Rest–has given way to multiple and horizontal flows, in which Asian countries play an increasingly significant role. While the US domination of the global media–both in entertainment and information–still remains a reality, new actors, harnessing the potential of digital globalisation, have emerged in the past decade to challenge Western or, more accurately, American hegemony in this arena. This warrants a re-evaluation of how we define the global in terms of media and communication. Focusing on the growing global influence and digital presence of China and India–the world’s two most populous nations with fastest growing economies–this essay suggests that the ascent of Asia could contribute to further internationalising of media and its study. © 2018, © 2018 Australian and New Zealand Communication Association.",China; Chindia; digital globalisation; global communication order; India; internationalising media studies

"Remeikiene R., Gaspareniene L., Schneider F.G.",The definition of digital shadow economy,2018,"Considering the lack of the scientific studies on the selected topic, the authors of this article raise the aim to set up the definition of digital shadow economy and identify its distinctive features and channels. Thus far, the studies on illegal digital activities have covered ambiguous interpretations of digital shadow economy that incorporated both criminal and economic aspects of the activities performed. The results of the empirical research have enabled to formulate the definition of digital shadow economy that refers to illegal activities, such as digital service provision and sales of goods/services online, when operating exceptionally in digital space, the entities violate the existent legal norms and regulations with a pursuit of illegal mutual interest and material benefits. The newly formulated definition of digital shadow economy has served as a corner-stone for identification of the distinctive features and channels of this phenomenon. Hence, the results of the research may make a significant and weighty contribution to the development of the theory of economics and may raise the awareness of what the phenomenon of digital shadow economy implies. © 2017 Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press.",Channels of digital shadow economy; Digital shadow economy; Features of digital shadow economy; Shadow economy
"Bataev A.V., Gorovoy A.A., Mottaeva A.",Evaluation of the future development of the digital economy in Russia,2018,"One of the world trends in economic development is the digital economy. The basis of the digital economy is new innovative forms of information and communication technologies. Moreover, today the digital economy is one of the drivers of economic growth; the pace of its development is several times higher than the pace of the traditional economy. The digital economy is the most promising direction under modern conditions when the world economy is influenced by the global financial and economic crisis and the recession that has followed it. The main advantages of the digital economy are the ability to significantly reduce costs of doing business, optimizing expenses, obtaining high financial results. Therefore, it is no coincidence that in many countries the development of the digital economy and its components is a priority. Huge amounts of money are being allocated to the digital transformation of the economy by both private business and state structures. In Russia, the implementation of the digital economy is also the priority nowadays; a state program was adopted aimed at the digital transformation of the Russian economy in 2017. The paper examines the perspectives for the digital economy development in the Russian Federation, studies the current situation of the digital economy in Russia, analyzes the conditions for the realization of the digital economy, assesses the investment climate in the Russian environment for the digital transformation of the economy, estimates the basic component of the industry 4.0 concept - robotics in modern Russian conditions and prospects for its development.

Yoon S.-C.,Servicization with skill premium in the digital economy,2018,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine an endogenous growth model, as a component of a broader study of servicization with skill premium and its policy implications in the evolving digital economy. Design/methodology/approach: This paper develops a two-sector endogenous growth model which allows for the observed characteristics of digitally empowered structural changes. Specifically, the driving force of economic growth is the expanding variety of intermediate services as a consequence of innovation in services. The introduction of new intermediate services specifically contributes to total factor productivity in the production of service sector, and thus an uneven growth path with skill premium toward a service economy generally exists. Findings: The principal finding of this paper is that the digitally empowered expanding variety of intermediate services due to innovation contributes significantly to total factor productivity in the production of service sector, and thus a servicization with skill premium generally exists along a steady-state path. In addition, this paper derives an optimal innovation policy to rule out the market failures due to innovation externality and market power in monopolistic competition conditions, and shows the Rybczynski effects of exogenous endowment changes in the evolving digital economy. Originality/value: The principal contribution of this paper is to determine how unbalanced endogenous growth along a steady-state path is linked with a service economy with skill premium in the evolving digital economy. In addition to this analysis, this paper provides policy implications – namely, that a positive but finite innovation subsidy can achieve the social optimum in the digital economy, and that an exogenous increase in high-skilled labor can speed up a digitally empowered economic growth. © 2018, Korea Trade and Research Association.",Digital economy; Evidence from Korea; Optimal innovation policy; Rybczynski effect; Servicization; Skill premium

In some studies, the digital economy is even interpreted as a new technological order and the fourth industrial revolution. At the same time, it is born and develops in the environment that is now commonly called the information society, being the basis for its life activity and experiencing, in its turn, the influence of the socio-cultural processes taking place in it. In this regard, we believe that if changes in the scale of the industrial revolution do occur, this will affect not only the economic situation, but also substantially rebuild the entire current social reality with its social institutions and regulatory complexes. This article shows at which levels such changes can occur. Initially, the existing and forecasted indicators of the digital economy in Russia and other countries are consistently considered in the article. Then the influence of digital technologies on the social stratification of society is shown.

"Dneprovskaya N., Urintsov A., Afanasev M.",Study of ƚśğ innovative environment of the digital economy,2018,"Emergence of digital economy indicates that good social and economic results are achieved due to synergistic effect of aggregate of information technologies and resources accumulated in the society, and their application by citizens and entrepreneurs for innovation activity. Modern technologies allow converting huge array of digital data into societally valuable knowledge. Which only happens, however, when these data are collected, stored and processed by businesses. Availability of digital advantages to economic subjects depends on the innovation environment and its conformity to the requirements of digital economy. The purpose of the study is to find how requirements for innovation environment are changed. Innovation environment is considered from three prospects: IT-infrastructure, information and knowledge resources, education. Development trends of the economy indicate its further globalization resulting in fast spread of innovations around the world. Thus, the study involved indicators that characterized the state of innovation environment in international cross-section. As official statistics estimates for innovation activity have not demonstrated any relationship between them, international patent data (inventions, utility models, industrial samples, trademarks) have been used as indicators of innovation activity results. Based on correlation analysis, those indicators have been selected that are most strongly related to innovation activity results. For IT infrastructure, the indicator of consumption of computer and communication technologies by countries has been considered. To characterize information and knowledge resources, international patent documents have been used. For estimation of impact of a higher education system, a number of top higher education institutions represented in the international ranking of 1000 universities have been considered. Obtained results show that innovation environment of digital economy is a distributed information network with multiple communication channels and digital data collection points. For its successful operations, sufficient computing capacity and high-speed data transmission channels need to be provided. As a result of development of global information society, a small group of countries have managed to create intellectual assets needed for its development (software, digital platforms), and these countries act as providers of the intellectual component of IT in the world arena. At the same time, the other countries have become consumers of these technologies. For the information and technology space being established to be used for creation of global innovations inside the country, development of intellectual assets and training of specialists need to be provided. Otherwise, opportunities of digitization of economy inside the country will be used by foreign companies. It is the higher education system that ensures that application of IT infrastructure creates innovations and accumulates intellectual capacity. © 2018 Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

It is revolutionizing the way we do business, and it has important implications for foreign direct investment (FDI). However, little systematic analysis has been done to investigate the investment patterns of digital multinational enterprises (MNEs). This study, conducted in the context of UNCTAD's World Investment Report 2017 (WIR17), is an attempt to fill some of the gap in knowledge and to provide an impetus for future research. It proposes a new interpretative framework for the digital economy, builds an extensive sample of digital and ICT MNEs, and profiles their international operations. Its main findings are that MNEs in highly digitalized industries have a “lighter” FDI footprint than traditional MNEs; they tend to concentrate their operations in a few highly developed countries and their investment patterns are shaped by fiscal and financial motives more than those of traditional MNEs. As digital technologies and business models tend to disseminate across the broader economy, this may suggest the onset of a new era of international production and MNE internationalization paths. This paper sheds light on the methodology underpinning the analysis in WIR17 to ensure full replicability and to prepare the ground for further work in the area.

This process is caused by the development of information infrastructure. The further growth of self-employed people can be expected because countries have entered a new type of digital economy which is based on Internet technologies and high levels of people's skills and competences. At the same time, the Russian economy is characterized by a rather large informal sector, that demands to take measures to legalize the activity of self-employed people and to bring them out of the shade.

"Reischauer G., Mair J.",Platform organizing in the new digital economy: Revisiting online communities and strategic responses,2018,"We are currently witnessing a new wave of the digital economy. A prime example is the sharing economy where an organization operates a platform for its online community, the sum of individuals who interact to exchange goods and services. The sharing economy blurs several boundaries of economic life - a fact that extant theory on platform organizing has yet paid little attention. We argue to consider two aspects of the sharing economy and revisit related theory to address this lacuna. First, we revive the concept of hybrid community to denote a variant of an online community that mirrors the boundary-blurring nature of the sharing economy. In a hybrid community, individuals interact both online and offline (instead of only online) and consume as well as produce. Second, we revisit the range of strategic responses suggested by extant literature to minimize the dependence of a platform organization on its hybrid community and show that the sharing economy requires management research to adapt and potentially recast existing claims. © 2018 by Emerald Publishing Limited.",Boundaries; Digital economy; Hybrid community; Online community; Platform organization; Resource dependence; Sharing economy; Strategy
"Bolwijn R., Casella B., Zhan J.",International production and the digital economy,2018,"Digitalisation has become a central theme in the current economic and policy debate. Large digital and tech multinational enterprises (MNEs) are gaining an outsized role in the global economy. Also, the adoption of advanced digital technologies across all industries is fundamentally changing production processes. Both these (interrelated) phenomena have profound implications for economic structures, employment, inequality and development and industrialisation opportunities. This chapter analyses the international production and investment (i.e., foreign direct investment [FDI]) implications of the digital economy. First, it empirically documents significant differences in internationalisation patterns between the largest digital MNEs and traditional MNEs; particularly, the tendency of digital MNEs to exhibit an asset-light international footprint. Second, it argues that the powerful transformational forces related to digital adoption and the new industrial revolution have the potential to change international production more broadly, favouring a shift towards internationalisation models characterised by decentralised production, accelerated servicification and extended disintermediation.

Conceptual basis for the new institutional environment can be represented by the theory of free culture, practical implementation of which provides the transition from agreement-based monopolistic rhetoric towards free utilization of the results of intellectual activity in the cyber environment. We conclude the need to define the legal regime for intellectual property, dependent on its intended use into commercial and non-commercial. We propose to free the sphere of noncommercial from as many legislative barriers as possible. We also propose to widen the use of simplified registration procedures with the participation of commercial organizations, as well as intellectual property (IP) data bases. The preservation of copyright in this sphere is sensible. The principles of equity, fairness should be fundamental institutions for the free utilization of IP. Authors propose the most open and vast rules of communication within the digital environment, which have evolved naturally. Separate standards exists in the form of concepts requiring practical implementation, others have been legally enforced, such as the priority of market mechanisms over government regulation of Internet, principle of balance of right-holders and users.

Rudskaia I.,"Transformation of manpower resources within the ""Digital economy"" program",2018,"In the conditions of the ""Digital Economy"" Program, changes in the labor market are an illustrative example of how digital technology affects our life. Human labor is replaced by new digital production facilities. They can already cope with record keeping, recruiting, and document management. Machines are self-learning and very efficient. It is obvious, that in the prospect of just 15-20 years those jobs that we attribute to the category of ""white collars"", i.e. jobs involving document circulation, introduction and primary processing of information will be no longer in demand: accountants, HR managers, lawyers specializing in claims and agreements will be a thing of the past. At the same time demand for programmers, database creation specialists, and system architects will grow. Another growth sector includes engineers designing automated devices that are traditionally called robots. The third direction is business engineering. We refer not to just business analysts, who study business systems, but specialist able to design, build and readjust business systems in a form of platforms. New specialists, able of taking decisions, especially in unusual situations, will be valued.

Particular attention is paid to the reorganization of the existing business models, strengthening the globalization of the financial system and the consumer market, the division of labor and the expansion of industry boundaries fraught with forced social restructuring of society, threatening the aggravation of social contradictions in the process of digitalization. It is shown that by means of the development of a new method of studying the structural stability of the social system to the influence of self-replicating factors of direct and indirect impact, based on the methods of simulation, supported by the logistics approach, it is possible to study the depth and consequences of the structures of changes in the existing social system.

The purpose of the article is a systems analysis of the structure of the cause and effect relationships between the informational efficiency of exchange prices, which affect the desired rate of return for investors; characteristics of the digital economy, methods used by entrepreneurs to evaluate specific assets. The analysis of the informational efficiency of markets based on the Fama-Samuelson criterion and conducted with the use of likelihood functions showed the down trend in the informativeness of exchange prices. According to the authors, this is due to a significant discrepancy in the price of transactions with real goods and futures operations, which are based on a variety of rational and irrational expectations. At the same time, the disproportionate growth of the derivative capital strengthens the influence of irrational expectations and contributes to the growth of the number of speculative transactions while the uncertainty of the external business environment is growing. Under these conditions, it is proposed to use the real options theory to evaluate specific tangible assets of entrepreneurial projects. Furthermore, the authors outlined the main characteristics of the digital economy in terms of entrepreneurship; carried out an analysis of market-based business opportunities resulting from the characteristics of the digital economy. On this basis, two causal chains are specified.

"Brown P.J., Beruvides M.G.","The perversion of certainty: Choice architecture, digital paternalism and virtual validation in the attention economy",2018,"The Attention Economy applies the principle of scarcity to attention as a commodity, which represents the limits inherent in the “neurophysiology of perception” and the social asset of available time. Within this new economy, human decision-making is being engineered through choice architecture algorithms and digital paternalism, which provide abridged subsets of information narrowing focus and reducing objectivity. Personal risk assessment is based largely on attitude certainty – the strength with which someone holds a belief. Technologically driven generations are immersed within the attention economy, which artificially enhances the sense of certainty through user-legitimized, virtual validation. Attitude certainty is now being developed through online manifestations of traditional mechanisms. This paper explores these online manifestations focusing on how and why they have become so influential. Beyond the awareness of the validation paradigm shift and the obvious technological deterministic implications, management impacts will be significant as online development of attitude certainty becomes pervasive and as a result, risk perception and subsequent risk behavior is less predictable. A brief analysis of the impact of these risks is presented to assist engineering managers and researchers in the on-going development of these issues. © Copyright© (2018) by American Society for Engineering Management (ASEM).

This paper considers some recent innovations in the digitalisation of the economy, which are intertwined with new forms of work and employment: Internet-based virtual work, on-demand work through online platforms, crowd working, and ‘prosumer’ work. Several dimensions of the employment relationship are called into question by these trends: concept of workplace (and its aspects related to working conditions); formation of wages; meaning and measurement of working time; blurring of reporting lines; representation of workers’ interests; and more generally the meaning of work and solidarity. © The Author(s) 2019.",
Micklitz H.-W.,Consumer law in the digital economy,2018,"Consumer law in the digital economy is oriented to social issues and not to a system of classification of whatever shape or form is predetermined by the respective legal system. The Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming the ostensible phenomenon in which consumer law and data protection law are increasingly intertwined. The legal questions which arise from this deterritorialized connectivity, concern the conclusion of contracts, contracting parties, problems around the legal classification of the actions of platforms, liability for defects, IT security, data protection and problems regarding the enforcement of rights in deterritorialized contexts. The paper takes German law as paradigmatic. If one looks into the making of the contract until the enforcement, from cradle to grave so to say, a whole set of laws come to the fore: unfair commercial practices prior to the conclusion of the contract, the rules of the German civil code on offer and acceptance and on the control of standard contracts, data protection law that affects the content of the contract, last but not least procedural rules on the enforcement of individual and collective rights, inside and outside courts. EU law is omnipresent in the law on unfair commercial practices, in the control of standard terms, in data protection, in the alternative dispute settlement and in collective redress through the action of injunction. German law, however, has three particularities which need to be highlighted: the key role of unfair terms and unfair commercial practices legislation in the monitoring of the digital economy, private enforcement through consumer associations and the evolution of consumer data protection law.

Pilishvili A.,The Impact of a digital platform on the financial corporation in modern Russia,2018,"The course taken by digital economy in the 21 century as is being presented by the government of the Russian Federation consists of informational technology capable of creating new markets as well as new opportunities in the financial sector. The successful growth in the digital economy is due to stronger financial positions in corporations, increase in the quantity and quality of financial tools utilized in the digital economy as well as growth in the interaction and preciseness of structures within financial institutions. A Financial corporation is defined as a legal entity in possession of organizations which function within the financial economic sector with a focus on credit, commercial banking, financial investment institutions, non-banking financial organizations, insurance companies, stock exchange and pension funds. The author discuses the digital economy in the context of Uralsib which addresses the decreasing of face to face contact between clients and front office representatives and the eventual shifting towards distance-based services. The practical application of digital economy with a focus on financial corporations can provide countries with better economic development, an increase in the number of successful startup businesses, digitalization of business processes, a stronger cybersecurity, better access of financial services for clients and more opportunities to educate the public on financial matters. The social impact that a move from corporations to a digital model can have by utilizing digitalization demonstrates how digital development can strengthen the economic state of a country in all its spheres. The most difficulty presented in the topic is found in the authors choice to delve deeper into digital models of financial corporations within Uralsib; a study that needs to be more integrated into business processes. The result of this study can challenge the digital economy of Russia to implement more practically based programmes within the financial sector. © 2018.",Digital economy; Digital model of financial corporation; Digitalization; Financial corporation; Uralsib

The novelty of the approach presented in this paper consists in the fact that the authors identify two classes of phenomena with regard to the category of ""sharing economy"". These phenomena are: 1) the shared use of similar or complementary resources for commercial purposes; and 2) the revival of communal economy traditions, i.e. the promoting ""reciprocity economy"". The article reveals characteristic features of the two components of the ""sharing economy"" concept, and presents their classification. In the framework of the first component two classes of relations are distinguished, namely strategic alliances without clearly defined central core, and concentric (focal) networks, where the platform plays the role of the central core. In the framework of the second component, the authors distinguish pooling of resources for shared use and mutual concession of rights on resources. The article places a priority on the reciprocity economy, which involves a radical change in the way of interaction between social agents, i.e. the transition from market to communal forms of relationships, as well as moving from the price method of coordination of activities to mutual agreement. The reciprocity economy is seen as an expected result of the transformation process of forms of ownership: the transition from the historically first communal property to private and public ownership eventually has led to the revival of community relationships, which have incorporated elements of the communal ownership and reciprocal exchange. Much attention is paid in the article to the consequences of the ""sharing economy"" development for the world economy. © 2018.",Communal property; Concentric network; Information technology; Reciprocal exchange; Reciprocity economy; Sharing economy; Strategic alliance

Jiménez A.M.,"BEPS, the Digital(ized) economy and the taxation of services and royalties",2018,"The BEPS project has left untouched very relevant opportunities for base erosion and profit shifting, mainly with payments for services and royalties, by MNE groups or even smaller enterprises. It is surprising that the debate about the digital or digitalized economy focuses so much on solutions (the concept of PE based on significant digital economic presence, withholding taxes for digital provision of services or goods or equalization levies) that do not contribute significantly to end up the base erosion and profit shifting opportunities that the BEPS project did not consider, is concentrating on solutions that will not be very helpful in fully aligning tax bases and economic activity and even abandons the BEPS already agreed standards to create a high degree of uncertainty and fragmentation. The article explains why the solutions proposed in the current debate on Action 1 BEPS are insufficient or disproportionate (they may be more political patches than effective remedies), and why more attention should be paid to a more evolutionary approach of the already BEPS agreed principles and standards or the traditional thresholds for taxing business profits, including the UN MC as it is evolving. A more robust international tax order will require to ponder more carefully if already known and agreed principles (including some BEPS outcomes within them), as they can evolve, will be better options to permit 'market states' to tax economic activity and will create less uncertainty than the revolutionary solutions proposed in the debates on Action 1 BEPS or unilaterally by the EU or some States. © 2018 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands.",
"Bianchini A., Pellegrini M., Rossi J., Saccani C.",A new productive model of circular economy enhanced by digital transformation in the Fourth Industrial Revolution - An integrated framework and real case studies,2018,"The socio-economic trends in the last decades (population growth, rapid industrialization and urbanization) have accelerated the transition from the old linear material flow to the more sustainable circular economy (CE). CE is recognized as a clear value creation opportunity, which can bring the lasting benefits of a more innovative, resilient and productive economy. Nevertheless, there is a huge gap between the big concept of CE and the practical actions. In particular, the research and the implementation of circular models to date have mainly focused on the product end-of-life, in order to reduce, reuse and recycle waste, but the lack of feedback information and performance indexes does not allow the measurement of how a product, a process or a company is really transiting from linear to circular models. This critical issue limits the further development of other circular activities. The impending digital transformation within the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution’ can support CE to provide these missing aspects. Starting from the consolidated CE model, the paper describes how the application of intelligent assets, Internet-of-Things and big data, could be the basis to create a more promising circular model, where CE principles are extended to the entire product life-cycle, from product design to product utilization, considering also production assets and business strategies. Some case studies, described in literature, are presented to demonstrate how smart assets can interact with circular economy to create a new and more productive model of CE, characterized by a complete and effective circular platform for materials, products, assets and processes, where information and indicators are collected to measure circular efficiency. © 2018 AIDI - Italian Association of Industrial Operations Professors.

This chapter examines the role of digital financial services (DFS) in the actualisation of the UN SDGs in Nigeria by presenting a series of illustrative cases of DFS-based public and private sector enterprises driving critical SDGs in Nigeria. These enterprises are not only driving economic growth, they are also enabling value chains addressing the broad-ranging needs of the poor. Tracing possibilities around impact is important here, a context in which over 60 per cent of the population lives below the poverty line. Statistics on poverty reflect not only lack of income but also the lack of access to essential services. Approximately 44 per cent of Nigeria’s adult population is financially excluded and could benefit from DFS in enabling an inclusive economy. © 2018 by Emerald Publishing Limited.

"Howell B.E., Potgieter P.H.",Bundles of trouble: Can competition law adapt to digital pricing innovation?,2018,"The burgeoning digital economy is characterized by bundled offers of goods and services, many with near-zero marginal cost, in highly concentrated markets often exhibiting competition ‘for the market’ and ‘winner-takes-all’ outcomes. Acceptable competitive behaviour in these markets likely differs substantially from that in markets for goods with standard economic characteristics. The suitability of current tools used to specify and enforce competition laws for governing commercial activity in a digital economy dominated by bundled offers is questionable. Classical market analysis focuses narrowly on individual product markets. In bundle product markets, quantitative econometric analysis becomes computationally intractable as the own- and cross-elasticities increase exponentially with the number of products in the bundle and providers in the market. Furthermore, classic econometric analysis cannot inform decisions in markets where bundles are yet to be offered. Simulation and numerical analysis of hypothetical scenarios under different consumer preferences and firm strategic choices offers another means of evaluating effects of intervention in specific circumstances. We illustrate using a model based on the (declined) proposed New Zealand merger between Sky Television and Vodafone and make recommendations for both theory and practice as to how simulation analysis can be used to complement more conventional competition analyses. © The Author(s) 2018.",Broadband; Bundling; Competition; Digital economy; Media content; Regulation

"Ustyuzhanina E., Evsukov S., Komarova I.",Network economy as a new economic system,2018,"This work deals with the study of new socio-economic relations, which are established due to the introduction of information and communication technologies. Associated problems are currently widely discussed in the scientific literature primarily from a technological point of view. Moreover, the attention is paid to ongoing and future changes in various markets, including the labor market. The article proposes to distinguish the concepts of digital revolution and digital economy. It is maintained that the digital revolution is not a technological revolution, but a social revolution that is comparable in importance to the Neolithic, Class and Industrial revolutions. It is grounded that the digital revolution results in the formation of a new economic system, which can be called the network economy. The research objective is to determine the key features of a new type of economy, namely, the forms of the division of labor peculiar to this system, the types of transactions, the ways of coordination of activities and the foundations of power. The scientific hypothesis of the work is the following one: The digital revolution leads not just to structural shifts in the economy and modification of the ways of market interaction, but to a fundamental change in the economic system. The research is based on the methodology of institutional theory. The result of the study is the substantiation of the statement about the change of the paradigm of economic development - the gradual replacement of the market economy by the network economy. © 2018 International Strategic Management Association.

This paper outlines the main barriers on the way of digitalization of economy and entrepreneurship in particular. As an example, dynamics of manufacturing industries in the Russian Federation for 2016-2018 was analyzed. Special attention is paid to the prospects of digital transformation of regional economic systems. The causes of interregional divergence are revealed. The main factors contributing to the convergent development of regions in the conditions of economic instability and new challenges of the external entrepreneurship environment are investigated. The use of the concept of convergent development of the regions aimed at overcoming territorial disintegration and regional inequality is substantiated. Long-term investments are regarded as a stimulating factor for application of innovative technologies in competitive economic market.

Turina A.,Which 'Source Taxation' for the digital economy?,2018,"This article is concerned with source-based approaches to the international tax challenges raised by the digitalization of the economy. It focuses, in particular, on what, in the current debate, is often referred to as a possible set of short-term or interim measures. After introducing the context from a broader socio-historical and business perspective, the article addresses the current complex tax policy agenda, aiming at outlining possible policy models to be derived from the OECD and EU ""platforms for proposals"", as well as from selected domestic experiences. In doing so, the article addresses a set of micro-research questions that appeared very relevant to the author in the current climate of uncertainty surrounding the taxation and digitalization agenda. First, the article is concerned with the need to conduct an exposition of terms by introducing some clarifying distinctions against the backdrop of the very blurred lines between the various policy options under consideration. In particular, it attempts to shed light on how a short-term or interim approach could actually be defined and in tracing some boundaries between equalization levies and a withholding tax-based approach. This exercise allows for some possible proposals to be set forth regarding how the concerned measures may be made more easily compliant with the pre-existing international legal framework and more attuned with their inherent policy objectives, also bearing in mind the need to minimize distortions as far as possible. This normative perspective is inherently tied to another set of 'micro-research questions' addressing how the policy and legal planes interact in this area and to what extent such initiatives might be pursued in accordance with a coherent set of policy goals in a way that would not prove disruptive for the existing legal framework of reference. In attempting to do so, however, the author realizes that there may be a clear trade-off between the above different sets of concerns, so that the undertaking of any action would need to implicitly express a fundamental option in that regard. Such findings are substantiated against the backdrop of some key unilateral experiences (including regional ones, as per the recent Directive proposal on the common system of a digital service tax) that have so far been enacted or ventilated, assessed in particular in the light of the recently released Interim Report on the Tax Challenges Arising from Digitalization. © 2018 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands.",

Robbins M.,"Internet, industry and international trade: Digital tradability in services",2018,"Rising use of digital technologies in the service sector is altering the rules of economic governance and of international trade. Theories of economic development and political economy, such as world-systems theory and Petty’s Law, are being contested by the digital revolution. As technological advances bypass old theory, the service sector is locating globally, with decreasing regard for geography and the assumptions of the old international economic order. This presents new challenges for a legal, commercial and international trade norms and system, which are designed to facilitate tangible cross-border commerce. Old theories of political economy must be revisited to account for the rise of digitally traded services and some, like Petty’s Law, may not survive emergent conditions. The services trade itself is inadequately considered in official government policy, and by international organizations seeking to promote trade, investment and greater cooperation. This work critically evaluates the policy initiatives of major players in trade in light of these trends in the digital economy. While economic institutions claim to advocate policies that are up to date with the new reality of trade, their approaches are still grounded in the superseded economic theories of the twentieth century. © 2018 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands.",

Quite often in developed economies, the role of IT has organically evolved over decades from a mere business support function to an efficiency driver and enabler, and finally (at least in some cases) to a driver of business innovation and digital transformation. Unlike developed countries, little is known about the role of IT in companies of countries with transitional economies, such as Russia. Historical, political, and geographical reasons have in many areas of life led to a “Russian way of doing things”. Does this also hold true for IT management?

This study proposes an industrial structure migration assessment model, and it finds that industrial structure in the study cities has radically and swiftly improved. A tendency towards inertia in structure adjustment, as well as cooperation tendencies in the course of transformation, are also confirmed in our results. These phenomena offer a favourable foundation for ‘Internet+’ economy diffusion in the study cities.

"Drewel M., Gausemeier J.",Digital B2B-platforms and how to find the right one,2018,"Digital platforms have been reshaping the structure of whole industries. While previous developments mainly have taken place within the B2C-or C2C-market, the B2B-market is at the edge of the so-called platform economy. Leading companies are stepping out of their core business and develop their own platforms. Additionally, agile start-ups begin to build platform solutions and services for digital platforms. For most of the SMEs in the machine building industry the development of digital platforms is not a suitable option as it exceeds their know-how and resources by far. These companies tend to participate in existing platforms instead of developing their own platform. The paper at hand presents a methodology that enables companies 1) to analyse which of their products and services are suitable for digital platforms 2) to find fitting digital platforms 3) to evaluate these platforms and 4) to develop an actual platform business model. The findings presented in the paper are the result of various projects with companies of the machine building industry and of over 40 interviews with management personalities within this segment. The results show that the intensity of the transaction and the individualization of products and services determine their suitability for digital platforms. We recognised distinct characteristics that can be used to evaluate platforms and we developed a role model which is the key to design a platform business model. The characteristics can be used within an identified softwaretool to search for suitable platforms. The findings will be of use for leading personalities within the machine building industry. Companies within this industry are put in a position to develop strategies for an advantageous positioning in the future platform economy. Furthermore the findings add a new approach to the well-established methodology toolbox of strategic planning. © 2018 Proceedings of the European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, ECIE.

Layton R.,Evidenced-based internet policy for emerging nations: Maximizing network investment and local content development,2018,"This article reviews the three components of evidence-based policy and the seven inputs to good regulation. It describes the challenges to conducting evidence-based policy, particularly with using data to make decisions as well as deploying measures to see how well a policy is working. Examples from net neutrality policy are provided to illustrate some of the challenges for telecom regulators. Some literature from the policy research field is presented to help explain why regulators have difficulty using evidence-based approaches. The paper concludes by reviewing the importance of evidence-based approached for regulators in emerging countries, particularly as net neutrality policy to date has limited documented success to stimulate local digital economies. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.",Broadband; Content development; Digital development; Digital divide; Digital economy; Emerging country; Evidence-based; Net neutrality; Regulation; Regulatory impact assessment; Telecom regulation; Zero rating
"Wu X., Gereffi G.","Amazon and Alibaba: Internet governance, business models, and internationalization strategies",2018,"In the digital economy, what are the strategies of multinationals from developed countries and emerging markets? How do regulations in the home country affect their growth? Recent digital multinationals in diverse national and institutional contexts raise questions that require new approaches in international business (IB) studies. This chapter examines two leading firms in the global e-commerce industry: Amazon and Alibaba. We compare their digital capabilities and physical asset-building strategies over the past two decades and we connect the Internet governance environment in the United States and China with their business models and internationalization patterns. We argue that despite the platform and global nature of Amazon’s and Alibaba’s activities, the recent moves of governments across the world to regulate Internet governance poses an important challenge for digital multinationals. This research features a comparative analysis of two prominent digital multinationals and identifies a promising area for future IB strategy studies. © 2019 by Emerald Publishing Limited All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.",Alibaba; Amazon; Business models; Digital economy; E-commerce; Internationalization strategies; Internet governance
Semyachkov K.,State management of Russian regions by means of digital technologies,2018,"In this paper, the tools for development of digital technologies in the public sector of Russia are considered. The main features and conditions for effective development of digital technologies are identified. The following elements are considered as the main components of digital development in the public sector: digital technologies; organizational structures and processes; institutional arrangements; socio-economic context. Based on the theoretical analysis, a model for development of the digital economy in the public sector is presented. The purpose of this study is to systematize the tools of digital development in the public administration. The study suggests an integrated indicator of informatization of the public sector in Russia, which includes the main indicators used in the international and Russian studies for analysis of development of ICTs. To analyze the use of digital technologies at the federal, regional and local levels, econometric models are constructed, the dynamics of ICT use in the public sector is shown. A model for assessing the quality of public administration in the ""involvement / satisfaction"" coordinates is proposed. This model was tested on the statistical data of Russian regions. Practical results have been obtained in the field of application of digital technologies at various levels of government. Based on the model for assessing the public administration in ""involvement / satisfaction"" coordinates, the patterns of digital technologies development in the regions of Russia were revealed. © 2018, Academic Conferences Limited.

"McAdam M., Crowley C., Harrison R.T.",Institutional voids and the emancipatory potential of digital entreprneurship: Evidence from Saudi Arabia,2018,"This paper examines the emergence of digital entrepreneurship in the context of emerging economies. Given that these economies generally lack a well-developed institutional framework, we draw on the concept of institutional voids as our theoretical lens. We argue that digital entrepreneurship facilitates the navigation and bridging of socio-cultural institutional voids but also provides opportunities for entrepreneurs to directly and indirectly alter the existing institutional context. We illustrate these arguments by drawing upon six biographical narrations of female digital entrepreneurs in Saudi Arabia. Accordingly, through our development of a multi-level model, we make explicit the two-way causative interaction between entrepreneurial action, institution altering behavior and the social and cultural context, thus providing a framework for future research. © 2018 Academy of Management.

de Wilde M.F.,Comparing tax policy responses for the digitalizing economy: Fold or all-in,2018,"This article elaborates on the tax policy responses in the area of direct taxation that are currently on the table at both the OECD and EU levels. The digital economy cannot be seen in isolation from the rest of the economy; it is the overall economy that is becoming increasingly digitalized. As any ring-fencing of the digital parts of the economy would seem infeasible, the fact that all the tax reform initiatives contemplated seem to be pursuing that exact objective is rather anomalous. Such a move would seem to bring little to the table other than market distortions, inequities, arbitrary taxation, tax cascading, legal uncertainties, and red tape. When it comes to fixing the broken international tax framework, there seems to be no such thing as a readily available 'quick fix'. So the real question on the table would seem to be whether we should instead consider breaking away from status quos in company taxation and proceeding to explore genuine and fundamental corporate tax reform. © 2018 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands.",

It is characterised by the pervasive implementation of convergent technologies, the shift in forms of ownership, fusion of cyber-physical and social realities, endowment of machines with elements of intellect and utilisation of social media in new communication alternatives. Such major social shifts will inevitably instigate a search for new methods of interaction between people and machines in all spheres, including economy, education, industry and everyday life. Gaining awareness of technological, economic and socio-Anthropological risks is the primary subject of this paper. The authors analyse various social transformation scenarios, which are fraught with tectonic shifts in the modern society: disappearance of the middle class and unqualified workers, decreasing migration of unskilled workers to Western countries and their self-isolation, and increasing potential migration of the middle class to developing countries. The paper conducts an Umwelt-Analysis of both man-machine system development prospects and the danger of the technological singularity, when machines endowed with artificial intelligence may create an economic and political situation that would threaten human strategic domineering and the very existence of humankind.

Cossu A.,Brands and productive publics in the event economy: The case of Milano Design Week,2018,"The economy of the event designates a production method (Bologna and Banfi, 2011) based on short-term events open to the public (festivals, exhibitions, fairs, etc.) and characterised by structural instability. In this context, successful events are pivotal in the global competition for a city to be perceived as truly creative (Florida, 2002). Success is measured by attendance (e.g. the number of visitors) and, increasingly, by the social media activity an event is capable of triggering. My contribution focuses on the role of publics as producers (Arvidsson, 2013) during Milano Design Week. A digital methods analysis (Rogers, 2013) is undertaken on a dataset of 10,000 Instagram photos along with a critical visual analysis (Rose, 2016). Through these methods I identify the communication patterns between the publics and the event’s main communication outlets, allowing me to assess the extent to which publics reproduce or resist the dominant aesthetics proposed by the Design Week brand.

The authors propose a theoretical research platform based on the theory of a new industrial society, substantiate a methodology, which comprises reproduction, institutional and synergetic approaches. The study showed that the transformation of the industrial complex, caused by any factors and implemented in any conditions, is always a discrete process of qualitative changes, resulting in significant structural changes and institutional transformations. The authors proposed a methodology to define the stages of industrial complex transformation in a digital economy. The authors' model of the digitization process consists of five stages - primary information and communication digitization; electronic data exchange with external partners; use of specialized software; electronic data exchange with external partners. Within this framework, an empirical analysis was carried out to determine the digitization level of the industrial complex of Russia that implies a sufficiently high degree of primary computerization, the involvement of the industrial enterprises in the ""digital"" communication with counterparties and the dynamic software development. The study shows that the process of digital transformation of the Russian industry is still in its formative stages. © Victoria Akberdina, Anna Kalinina, Andrey Vlasov, 2018.",Digitization stages; Industry 4.0; Industry transformation; New industrialization
Sinha S.,Gender digital divide in India: Impacting women’s participation in the labour market,2018,"Digital technology and globalization has brought in a sea change in the landscape of work with increasing access to work, information, newer production hubs, etc. In India, there had been significant strides in digital intervention through Digital India initiative, Aadhaar (unique identity number), JAM, ICT initiatives to enhance women’s economic autonomy, newer production structure, digital transactions, etc. In the labour market in India, however, most of the workers are informal workers. Women are either self-employed (mostly unpaid family workers) or casual workers, working mostly at the lower rung of the occupational ladder as agricultural labourers, petty traders, manufacturing outworkers, etc. In this context, the paper explores whether women can leverage the opportunities, be it trade or manufacturing or financial services, created by digital transformation. The study argues that differences in access along with factors like inequality in education and professional training, access to finance, asset holding, etc. lead to gender digital divide, restricting the transformational effects that digital technologies are creating. Women are typically employed at the last end of the value chains or occupational chain and bereft of any social security and in survivalist state, rather than growing. The paper suggests a set of policies so that women in India are a part of and benefit from the digital dividends. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.",Digital gender gap; Employment; ICT; Platform economy; Second digital divide
"Pȋnzaru F.M., Mitan A., Mihalcea A.D.",Reshaping Competition in the Age of Platforms: The Winners of the Sharing Economy,2018,"Since the beginning of industrialization, the pipeline business model has dominated world economies: products were created by a producer, be it a person or a company, then customers were informed that they could buy those products, and the cycle closed with the proper selling of those goods to customers. In recent years, this linear mode of doing business has started to be replaced by platforms. While platforms are not a new way of doing business—fairs are the classic platform prototype—the use of ITC in creating, managing, and accessing platforms stimulated the appearance of a different approach to this business model, providing benefits for all of the economic actors participating in the digital economy. This chapter presents some of the particularities of digital platform business models and argues in favor of their benefits by referring to a number of worldwide famous businesses, in fields from education to transportation and commerce, constructed according to these models. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.",

This study was conducted at the Faculty of tourism, located at Palma de Mallorca. It concerned undergraduate students from the third year in tourism and considered as future entrepreneurs. They represented 70.83% of the target population (120 students). Results pointed out that, the proposed model explained 47.8% of total variance in the intention to accept tourism. They also revealed that Anxiety and Perceived Ease of Use factors influenced significantly this intention. However, Attitude and Perceived Usefulness factors showed no significant impact on the future entrepreneurs’ intention.

"Burtch G., Carnahan S., Greenwood B.N.",Can you gig it? an empirical examination of the gig economy and entrepreneurial activity,2018,"We examine how the entry of gig-economy platforms influences local entrepreneurial activity. On the one hand, such platforms may reduce entrepreneurial activity by offering stable employment for the unemployed and underemployed. On the other hand, such platforms may enable entrepreneurial activity by offering work flexibility that allows the entrepreneur to redeploy resources strategically in order to pursue the nascent venture. To resolve this tension, we examine the entry of the ridesharing platform Uber X into local areas. We use two measures of entrepreneurial activity: crowdfunding campaign launches at Kickstarter, the world's largest reward-based crowdfunding platform, and levels of self-employment from the Current Population Survey. Results indicate a negative and significant relationship between platform entry and both measures of entrepreneurial activity. Importantly, the effect manifests primarily amongst unsuccessful Kickstarter campaigns and unincorporated entrepreneurial ventures, suggesting that gig-economy platforms predominantly reduce lower quality entrepreneurial activity, seemingly by offering viable employment for the unemployed and underemployed. These relationships are corroborated with a first-hand survey conducted with gig-economy service providers. © 2018 INFORMS.",Crowdfunding; Difference in difference; Digital platforms; Entrepreneurship; Gig economy; Necessity-based entrepreneurship
Premat C.,Can the French Republic Be Digital? lessons from the last participatory experience on the law-making process,2018,"A new law on the Digital Republic was voted in France at the end of 2016. It focused on the definition of digital rights, Net neutrality and the idea of a public service of data. The law was coproduced by the citizens as it was possible to amend the bill proposal on the Net. In fact, it was the first time in France that a bill was digitally amended by citizens. The chapter aims at analyzing the participatory method as a law-making option in France. The question is to understand whether or not this participatory method challenges the traditional way of governing in France. Is it the implementation of a citizen control of the law-making process or a single communicative tool? The first part of the chapter describes the relations between the European and the national contexts of this law. The second part of the chapter explains the participatory tool, introduces the actors and analyzes the impact of the method on the law-making process. The third part of the chapter studies the emergence of an open government data in France. This digital strategy is promoted in order to win the competition of digital nations (Premat, Smarter as the new Urban Agenda: a comprehensive view of the 21st century city, 207–224, 2015).

"Zhong S., Pearce J.M.",Tightening the loop on the circular economy: Coupled distributed recycling and manufacturing with recyclebot and RepRap 3-D printing,2018,"A promising method of enhancing the circular economy is distributed plastic recycling. In this study plastic waste is upcycled into 3-D printing filament with a recyclebot, which is an open source waste plastic extruder. The recyclebot is combined with an open source self-replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap) 3-D printer, to enable post-consumer ABS plastic filament from computer waste to be further upcycled into valuable consumer products pre-designed in the digital commons. The total electrical energy consumption for the combined process is monitored and an economic evaluation is completed. The coupled distributed recycling and manufacturing method for complex products reduces embodied energy by half, while reducing the cost of consumer products to pennies. This economic benefit provides an incentive for consumers to both home recycle and home manufacture, which tightens the loop on the circular economy by eliminating waste associated from transportation and retail. It is clear from the results that waste plastic can be significantly upcycled at the individual level using this commons-based approach. This tightening of the loop of the circular economy benefits the environment and sustainability as well as the economic stability of consumers/prosumers. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Circular economy; Distributed manufacturing; Distributed recycling; Energy conservation; Polymer recycling; Sustainable development

As a research methodology, the authors used their own approach, based on carrying out an interval analytical grouping on a multidimensional average. 17 indicators were selected to calculate the multidimensional average. The indicators characterise technical and economic conditions for digitalization. Using the correlation analysis, the authors developed a mechanism to emit «noise» factors, i.e. factors which do not impact the general tendencies. The results of the analysis show the absence of a clear relationship between the level of socio-economic development and readiness for digitalization in the lower groups of regions. There is no clearly defined geographical dependence. Meanwhile, the City of Moscow and Moscow region are considered to be the leading regions. In the group with an average integral indicator, there appeared regions, which were the first to start switching to digital content. The main problem of digitalization is the lack of financial resources. In this connection, it is determined that the most effective way to finance digitalization is a public-private partnership. © Institute of Society Transformation, 2018.",Correlation Analysis; Digital Economy; Digitalization; Interval Grouping; Multidimensional Average; Regions of the Russian Federation

This approach however is guided by policies that exhibit chronic disconnections among stakeholders in the culture and tourism sectors of the economy. Digital capital in the form of common website should be a point of convergence for policy makers, host communities and tourists (cultural) to increase the Tourism Consumption Expenditure (TCE). The research is informed by the desire to consider cultural tourism as a niche that does not call for deployments of huge financial resources. The objectives of the study were to establish stakeholders' views on the existence of partnerships, to ascertain the benefits of digital capital in sustainable cultural tourism and to find out the challenges that stakeholders encounter in forging partnerships as well as employing digital capital in sustainable cultural tourism. Qualitative research was used and 15 interviews were conducted with stakeholders in the culture and tourism sector. The findings indicated that the country stood to benefit from interactions between digital capital and partnerships. The benefits to be realised were way off the mark due to lack of a common purpose to sell effectively the country's cultural assets. The triad of digital capital, cultural capital and partnerships was applauded by all the respondents. The task to initiate the adoption of digital capital for the benefit of the country was given to the government. The study recommends tourism and culture stakeholders and ICT technical partners be brought together to develop a common digital platform whose purpose is to market the cultural capital that is available in Zimbabwe. It is also recommended that partnerships and digital capital adoption be enforced by the government as it is the overall guardian of the national resources. © 2018 AJHTL.",Culture; Digital capital; Partnerships; Tourism; Tourism stakeholders
Sapovadia V.,"Financial Inclusion, Digital Currency, and Mobile Technology",2018,"It is paradox that in globalized world more than one third of its population is excluded from formal financial system. The body of evidence suggests that appropriate financial services can help improve household welfare and promote small enterprises. The financial exclusion is attributed to various reasons. Conventional financial system has several inherent limitations which lead to unserved population. Digital currency and mobile technology can spur penetration of financial system partially in unserved population. The evidence shows that high cost for small ticket size financial transaction in conventional financial system makes the transactions unviable. Digital currency and mobile technology can cater the needs of small transaction at affordable cost. It can also help reducing time, more accurately and make faster transactions in bulk. Many emerging economies like India, Brazil, and Nigeria have embarked on mobile technology to overcome financial exclusion.

"Turi A.N., Domingo-Ferrer J., Sánchez D.",Problems in the undertakings of the collaborative economy: Co-utile solutions,2018,"In the current era of the digital economy, the collaborative economic system, being a successor of the capitalist system, has led to a greater wave of sharing of scarce resources and to the creation of interdependent networks of rational beings. In spite of its promising features of abundant liquidity and efficient utilization of the underutilized scarce economic resources, the system is still in its early stages of development and suffers from some serious problems that hamper its deployment. In order to unlock the potential of this economic system, there is a need for conciliating the individual freedom of economic agents and the common good of the information society encompassing it. In this chapter, we tackle this issue by relying on the recently minted concept of co-utility, which refers to a self-enforcing and mutually beneficial interaction among self-interested agents. By means of co-utility, we aim at mending some of the fractures underlying the collaborative economy due to key hindering factors for potential collaboration. Further, the potential collaborations within each of the use cases presented in this text (i.e., the crowd-based business models and the P2P online lending market) are fostered by co-utile solutions, arising either naturally or artificially through incentive schemes. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",
"Kumar S.N., Puttanna K.",Payments transition in India – Consumer preferences and policy shifts,2018,"Economic growth should be supplemented by an efficient payment and settlement system. Many attempts have been made to improve the efficiency of payment and settlement system in India. Especially the effort has been in terms of promoting digital economy. But the stickiness to payments through currency notes by the people has had a moderating effect on these efforts. The policy shift of Government of India towards demonetization of higher denomination currency notes has given thrust to digital payments. The study hypothesizes that post demonetization, the payment and settlement system indicators would show moderate to high deviation from the volume and value that can be forecasted using the historical data. Using Automatic ARIMA Forecasting in EViews, the forecasted values for the indicators for a period from November 2016 to March 2018 were estimated based on the historical data of the indicators from April 2011 to October 2016. The forecasted values of the indicators are then compared with the actual values of the indicators to see if they differ significantly by using paired t-test. The study finds evidence to suggest that the policy of demonetization and resultant reduced supply of currency notes has provided impetus to the Indian public to move towards digital platforms, and the increased supply of currency notes thereafter has not led to complete reversal of this shift in this change in consumer preference. This leads to the conclusion that through effective policy shifts, consumer preferences can be altered, and the Indian economy could become a less cash economy. © Subrahmanya Kumar N., Puttanna K., 2018.",Banking; Cashless economy; Demonetization; India; Less cash economy; Payment; Settlement system

"Bergeaud A., Cette G., Lecat R.",Long-term growth and productivity trends: Secular stagnation or temporary slowdown?,2018,"Economic growth in advanced countries has slowed in successive stages since the 1970s and, since the crisis, has fallen to a historical low compared with the 20th century. This slowdown is mainly attributable to weaker growth in total factor productivity. In emerging countries, the situation varies: in some countries, such as South Korea and Chile, GDP per capita have been converging for several decades; in others, such as Argentina, Brazil and Mexico, relative GDP per capita has stagnated or even declined. While weak long-term growth in these latter countries can be attributed to a lack of appropriate institutions, the widespread slowdown observed in advanced countries is more difficult to interpret. One possible explanation that we explore is the decline in real interest rates since the 1990s. A circular relationship appears to exist between interest rates and productivity: productivity determines long-term returns on capital and thereby interest rates; interest rates in turn determine the minimum productivity expected from investment projects. The decline in real interest rates, which is in part attributable to demographic factors, may have led to a slowdown in productivity by making an increasing number of unproductive companies and projects profitable. We illustrate this circular relationship using a cross-country panel regression. One way of breaking out of the circular relationship would be via a new technological revolution linked to the digital economy, or, in countries where there is still room for convergence, via structural reforms to improve the diffusion of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). © OFCE.

"van Gils B., Proper H.A.",Enterprise modelling in the age of digital transformation,2018,"The digital transformation forces enterprises to change. In addition, the notion of economic exchange, core to the economy, has shifted from following a goods-dominant logic to a service-dominant logic, putting the focus on continuous value co-creation between providers and consumers. These trends drive enterprises to transform continuously. During enterprise transformations, coordination among the stakeholders involved is key. Shared understanding, agreement, and commitment, is needed on topics such as: the overall strategy of the enterprise, the current affairs of the enterprise and its context, as well as the ideal future affairs.Models, and ultimately enterprise modelling languages and frameworks, are generally seen as an effective way to enable such (informed) coordination. To this end, different languages and frameworks have been developed, including ArchiMate. ArchiMate, which has evolved to become a widely accepted industry standard, was developed at a time where the digital transformation was not yet that noticeable. At that the time, the focus was more on consolidation and optimisation. As such, it is logical to expect that the existing ArchiMate language may require some “updates” to be ready for digital transformations. The objective of this paper is therefore threefold: (1) posit, based on practical experiences and insights, key challenges which the digital transformation puts on enterprise (architecture) modelling languages, (2) assess to what extent ArchiMate meets these challenges, and (3) provide suggestions on how to possibly improve ArchiMate to better meet these challenges. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2018.",ArchiMate; Digital transformation; Enterprise modelling

de Silva I.,Assessing online platform mergers: Taking up the new challenges faced by the French Competition Authority in the digital,2018,"The purpose of this article is to share the lessons learned by the French Competition Authority (""FCA"") following its first in-depth investigation of a merger case involving two major online platforms. The FCA believes that anti-competitive risks arising out of Internet platform mergers must be carefully assessed through a case-by-case analysis accompanied by a large body of evidence, in order to conduct a proper investigation. Examples of evidence used in this case include a focus on the typology of platforms, the type of services they provide, their sources of revenue, and the behavior of their users on each side of the market. Questions concerning potential competitive pressure, especially from super-platforms, in addition to potential barriers to expansion, were also at the core of the analysis. The competitive assessment focused on specific risks posed by this kind of merger, such as the impact of a change of scale and of data collection on the remaining effective competition in the market. The FCA has laid the first stone in developing an innovative approach that can be used in the future to assess mergers in the digital economy. © 2018 Institute of Competition Law.",Internet; Investigations/Inquiries; Market power; Mergers; Online platforms
Van Den Berg C.,21 st Century Learning: Changes to knowledge acquisition in a digital world,2018,"This paper reviews the skills required in a digital world by knowledge workers and the teaching and learning environment to enable 21st-century learning. The aim is to help alleviate the discrepancy of the competencies that are being developed in formal education versus what is required in a digital world. Digital transformation is being driven by a range of new technologies that are blurring the boundaries between people, the Internet and the physical world. This transformation causes disruption in economies and creates new challenges, but also opportunities for growth. New strategies, ideas, products and markets are required in order to transform the way we live, work and relate to one another. This furious pace of technological innovation is forcing organisations to be more flexible in adopting changes and making decisions. Organisations therefore need to become more responsive, agile, creative and innovative. This digital revolution requires businesses, governments and individuals to anticipate trends and prepare for future skills requirements. Organisations need to develop a flexible workforce with the ability to change and adapt within a complex global economic environment. This flexibility requires changes to knowledge acquisition to prepare students for an uncertain, complex and ambiguous world and further afford them the opportunity to practise these skills. Students need to move beyond the current horizons of knowledge and skills within a specific discipline and develop a sense of self in order to be adaptable, which requires a curriculum that is future proof. A framework to guide educators in the development of the necessary skills and competencies in order to equip future leaders with skills to facilitate business transformation is required. To address this, a design-based research study using a mixed-methods research design that applied three iterations was undertaken in 2016 and 2017. The outcome is design principles for a teaching and learning environment to facilitate 21st-century learning to develop competent knowledge workers. © 2018 Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

Inglese M.,The collaborative economy legal conundrum: A way forward through harmonization,2018,"The collaborative economy has recently arisen as a new phenomenon, disrupting some of the most consolidated acquisitions of the European Union's internal market. At the national level, tribunals, legislatures and municipalities have to cope with new regulatory challenges for which old patterns are no longer suitable. Consumers and economic operators, in turn, are exploiting the countless opportunities the collaborative economy brings. Against this background, this article will be structured as follows. First, it will identify the constitutive elements of the collaborative economy, linking them to the completion of the EU digital single market in light of the judgments involving Uber recently delivered by the Court of Justice of the European Union. Second, since the Italian Parliament has a legislative proposal in the pipeline aimed at boosting the collaborative economy and at regulating online platforms, this specific national experience will be taken as a model for a possible EU regulatory intervention. Third, taking stock of that element, this article will argue in favour of an EU legislative act in the form of a directive that would regulate at least the most controversial aspects of the collaborative economy. In conclusion, this article will forward the argument that such a directive would benefit both operators and consumers, enhancing transparency in online transactions as well as improving legal certainty. © 2018 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands",

Abdullahi R.B.,"Volunteerism in urban development the case of non-cash, non-digital crowdfunding growth in Nigeria",2018,"Crowdfunding is a digital-based tool for mobilizing cash for various projects contributing to urban development. This chapter argues that for societies with low digital penetration and less cash but with huge human resources and high physical interaction, crowdfunding should be used as tool for mobilizing human capital for urban development. In this sense, volunteering is a form of crowdfunding. This chapter explores the influence of volunteers in developing and maintaining their urban communities. As an activity aimed at promoting the welfare of other individuals or groups through services or cash transfers, volunteerism is a useful tool for emerging economies to fill the gap between their development resource demand and availability. Review of few relevant concepts and experiences reveal the potential contributions of paid and unpaid volunteers in Africa with a focus on the efforts to shift the Nigerian economy from an oil-based to an urban-based. © 2018 by IGI Global.",
Selloni D.,Co-design in a ‘social’ sharing economy. Understanding levels of citizen participation in collaborative services,2018,"The aim of this chapter is to discuss a ‘minor’ characteristic of the sharing economy, focused on local exchange trading systems that arise from creative communities and local social innovations. This is the ‘social side’ of the sharing economy, quite different from the well-known digital platforms that are actually multinational companies allowing commercial exchanges amongst a variety of actors. As service designers researching in the field of social innovation, we are interested in exploring the sharing economy under this particular perspective; more specifically, we wish to centre on the contribution of the user (or, better, of the community of citizens–users) in developing this new generation of collaborative services. To do so, we build upon a series of Italian case studies coming from the ‘Creative Citizens’ programme held within the POLIMI DESIS Laboratory of the Politecnico di Milano. Finally, we discuss the interconnection between the various levels of citizen participation in such collaborative services, starting from co-design and then focusing on co-production, co-management and co-ownership. More specifically, highlighting how co-design may be a powerful means to pre-define roles and responsibilities, from both a practical and a formal point of view. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.",
"Mapokgole J., Tengen T.",Ways on how digital technology can streamline supply chain management of today,2018,"Todays' world has resulted in extremely more complex traditional supply chains, where technological changes in the economy happen at a very fast pace. It is even made more complex due to emergence of digital technology, which is disrupting traditional operations which calls for all businesses to be digitally oriented. Traditional business cannot unlock full potential of digital without reinventing their supply chain strategy. Most companies understood the nature of these changes and are worked on introducing digital technology in their operations, however, an introduction of digital technology is not the answer for competitiveness advantage. We proposes an approach that overlooks at the fundamental differences between traditional supply chains that have been enhanced digitally and truly integrated, reinvented supply with fundamentally digital DNA. It is proved in the study that for businesses to realize benefits of digital technology, businesses need to reinvent their supply chain strategy, reimagine supply chain as a digital supply network that units talent, information and finance and not only physical flows which has been the case with traditional companies. This solution further encourages companies to remain more connected, scalable and rapid than traditional supply chain management. This network enables people and data, as well as material, products and supplies to travel together across the extended enterprise. © IEOM Society International.",
"Vaclavik M.C., Pithan L.H.",The agency search: The meaning of work for app drivers,2018,"Purpose: This study aims to investigate how app drivers are giving meaning to their work, taking as a theoretical assumption the model proposed by Rosso, Dekas, & Wrzesniewski (2010). Originality/value: Internationally, the volume of empirical research involving digital labor markets is considered to be low. Nationally, research in the context of Sharing Economy rarely focuses on the labor perspective. Despite being a growing phenomenon, no studies were found on the production of meanings and meaningfulness of work by app drivers. Design/methodology/approach: This qualitative and exploratory research was carried out with 37 app drivers between May and September 2017, in Porto Alegre (RS, Brazil). Randomly selected, respondents were called to a work route by the transport application. The interviews' content was categorized and analyzed according to the framework of Rosso et al. (2010). Findings: Elements that refer to all the model quadrants were found: “self-connection”, “individuation”, “contribution”, and “unification”. The predominant meaning, however, is desire, seeking and valuing by the agency, in the mechanisms of self-efficacy and self-management, especially in the financial, autonomy and flexibility perspectives. This research contributes to the intersection of the study of the labor world transformations and the construction of meanings and meaningfulness, using a framework little used in Brazilian research.

Piccinno G.,Between the digital and the physical: Reinventing the spaces to accommodate sharing services,2018,"The sharing economy is based on a mentality shift of the people that are everyday more lean to share their private life through the social networks with a resulting establishment of a collective consciousness and an increase of trust in each other through the act of sharing. Consequently, the physical spaces must also be considered today as new entities involved in the phenomena of sharing, supporting, together with their environmental, functional and aesthetic characteristics, the various sharing activities. Moreover, in the information society, we live simultaneously in different spaces and times and the digital access to services sometimes needs to be transformed into something more physical to permit the real exchange of experience and knowledge, to meet real people in a material arena. The boundary between virtual and physical space is getting everyday thinner and more invisible because, nowadays, digital devices are defining the landscape in the urban scenario, establishing interactions and links regardless of the materiality of a place itself. What happens is a sort of dematerialization of the physical space which supports a no-stop digital flow, filtered by the social system of relationships. People in fact assume the role of the interface between the two spaces, defining urban landscape and spatial relationships through digital systems. According to the principles of sharing economy, people may act as a physical link into the space in order not to lose the relationships that take place in the physical dimension, while the current social life is quickly shifting to a virtual scale. Sharing activities in the public space would transform the city scenario itself into a stage for people aggregation, where users generate an online/offline information’ landscape through physical–digital actions, defining and designing at the same time flow patterns in both physical and virtual spaces. In this context, the aim of this chapter is to analyse how the use of space changes in the different sharing services and how it should be redesigned to accommodate them to the best, according to experts of spatial design. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.",

"Tasca P., Hayes A., Liu S.",The evolution of the bitcoin economy: Extracting and analyzing the network of payment relationships,2018,"Purpose: This paper aims to gather together the minimum units of users’ identity in the Bitcoin network (i.e. the individual Bitcoin addresses) and group them into representations of business entities, what we call “super clusters”. While these clusters can remain largely anonymous, the authors are able to ascribe many of them to particular business categories by analyzing some of their specific transaction patterns (TPs), as observed during the period from 2009 to 2015. The authors are then able to extract and create a map of the network of payment relationships among them, and analyze transaction behavior found in each business category. They conclude by identifying three marked regimes that have evolved as the Bitcoin economy has grown and matured: from an early prototype stage; to a second growth stage populated in large part with “sin” enterprise (i.e. gambling, black markets); to a third stage marked by a sharp progression away from “sin” and toward legitimate enterprises. Design/methodology/approach: Data mining. Findings: Four primary business categories are identified in the Bitcoin economy: miners, gambling services, black markets and exchanges. Common patterns of transaction behavior between the business categories and their users are a “one-day” holding period for bitcoin transactions is somewhat typical. That is, a one-day effect where traders, gamblers, black market participants and miners tend to cash out on a daily basis. There seems to be a strong preference to do business within the bitcoin economy in round lot amounts, whether it is more typical of traders exchanging for fiat money, gamblers placing bets or black market goods being bought and sold. Distinct patterns of transaction behavior among the business categories and their users are flows between traders and exchanges average just around 20 BTC, and traders buy or sell on average every 11 days. Meanwhile, gamblers wager just 0.5 BTC on average, but re-bet often within the same day. Three marked regimes have evolved, as the Bitcoin economy has grown and matured: from an early prototype stage, to a second growth stage populated in large part with “sin” enterprises (i.e. gambling, black markets), to a third stage marked by a sharp progression away from “sin” and toward legitimate enterprises. This evolution of the Bitcoin economy suggests a trend toward legitimate commerce. Originality/value: The authors propose a new theoretical framework that allows investigating and exploring the network of payment relationships in the Bitcoin economy. This study starts by gathering together the minimum units of Bitcoin identities (the individual addresses), and it goes forward in grouping them into approximations of business entities, what is called “super clusters”, by using tested techniques from the literature. A super cluster can be thought of as an approximation of a business entity in that it describes a number of individual addresses that are owned or controlled collectively by the same beneficial owner for some special economic purposes. The majority of these important clusters are initially unknown and uncategorized. The novelty of this study is given by the pure user group and the TP analyses, by means of which the authors are able to ascribe the super clusters into specific business categories and outline a map of the network of payment relationships among them. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Bitcoin; Blockchain; Business analysis; Digital currencies; Network theory; Payment traceability
Aloisi A.,The role of european institutions in promoting decent work in the “collaborative economy”,2018,"This chapter aims at discussing the European approach to regulating the so-called “collaborative economy”, by looking at the main legislative initiatives regarding this set of fast-growing digital companies. Despite the potential efficiencies and benefits for customers, more recently, a counter-narrative has started revealing the “broken promise” of managing a contingent workforce mobilised on a “just in time” and “just in case” basis. The second section briefly describes the “collaborative economy” landscape and the dissemination of the heterogeneous category of “non-standard forms of employment” in the European scenario. The third section discusses the Uber case, the most visible symptom of a consolidated tendency towards fragmentation of the once solid relationship between the worker and the employing entity. In this respect, a recent ruling by the European Court of Justice on the nature of the service provided by the “transport platform” is analysed in depth. The fourth section investigates the European communications and resolutions which adapt the current legal framework and provide guidelines for regulating work in the collaborative economy, namely the Communication on the European agenda for the collaborative economy, the European Pillar of Social Rights, and other Parliamentary initiatives. The study is based on a theoretical and descriptive methodology. This chapter concludes by recommending a cautious regulatory approach. It has been highlighted that many online platforms are still in their business “infancy”, and experts genuinely do not know how they will develop. Consequently, legislative headlong rushes may end up crystallising the present state of the art, thus hindering “peripheral” entrepreneurial initiatives and blocking innovation. Surgical regulatory interventions shall help platform companies to adjust and improve their business model, in order to enter a new phase of “shared social responsibility”. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.",
Bratianu C.,The Crazy New World of the Sharing Economy,2018,"The purpose of this chapter is to explore the new ideas promoted by the sharing economy and to explain the novel business models operating in today’s turbulent economic environment. Sharing economy departs from the existing economic structures and focuses on ownership, by promoting flexible networking architectures and free access to sharing resources and activities. Considering Uber as a symbol of the new business dynamics, the chapter reveals some of the emerging changes and their role in shaping the new business environment. Uber comes with a new business model which is based on ownership outsourcing and the transformation of its drivers from employees into microentrepreneurs. The whole business operation is done through a powerful digital platform which provides fast connections between the managers, drivers and people using transportation services. Also, Uber introduces a price dynamics mechanism which computes the transportation costs as a function of demand and supply in that particular context and time. This system constitutes and effective core competence for achieving competitive advantage. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.",

A recent study showed that some female platform workers receive lower pay than their male counterparts. As some online platforms use algorithms to determine pay levels, the key question addressed here is to the extent to which current EU gender equality law, and the principle of equal pay for women and men in particular, is adequate for protecting platform workers in a situation where work-related decisions are not taken by a human being but by an algorithm that is the potential source of discrimination. To understand how regulation should be 'calibrated' in cases where algorithms result in discrimination, the theory of classification bias can be helpful. It is assumed that the reason for providing protection based on the equal pay principle to a specific group of employees is not compelling enough to exclude platform workers who are classified as self-employed. This article starts with a brief examination of the challenges of working in the digital economy and then goes on to analyse the role of algorithms and their potential to discriminate based on gender. It is argued that the theory of classification bias could be used to address discriminatory algorithmic decision-making. The theory is then applied to the EU's principle of equal pay for women and men, suggesting some improvements in relation to platform work. © 2018 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands.",

El método para lograr este objetivo consiste en comprobar que el objetivo de los delitos contra la propiedad en el entorno de la economía de mercado y el desarrollo de la sociedad de la información es el bien económico más importante que tiene valor real. Esta lógica se realiza igualmente por la criminalidad; recientemente ha habido una creciente frecuencia de delitos dirigidos a la incautación ilegal de esta propiedad inmaterial y causando así un daño significativo a la economía. Por lo tanto, es necesario mejorar la protección legal de la información de computadora en la propiedad con el uso de recursos penales, reconociéndola como el objetivo de los delitos contra la propiedad, los robos.

The method for achieving this goal con-sists in substantiation of the fact that the target of crimes against property in the environment of market-based economy and development of the information socie-ty is the most important economic good which has real value. This logic is equally realized by the criminality; there has recently been an increasing frequency of crimes aimed at unlawful seizure of this immaterial property and thus causing sig-nificant damage to the economy. Therefore, it is necessary to enhance the legal protection of computer information on property with the use of criminal remedies, recognizing it as the target of crimes against ownership, thefts.

"Oklander M., Oklander T., Yashkina O., Pedko I., Chaikovska M.",Analysis of technological innovations in digital marketing,2018,"The main technological innovations in digital marketing as a specific form of marketing under conditions of the informatization of society have been examined. It has been substantiated that the principal direction of digital marketing is the personalized attitude to users. It has been proven that the personalized relationship with a potential customer becomes the essence of marketing, the core of its effectiveness. It is shown that digital methods for processing and using information becoming the main source for improving marketing efficiency. The need for a comparative analysis of the technological innovations of digital marketing is predetermined by the fact that the scientific and technical development stimulates the emergence of a significant number of methods that have an influence on the consumer. Studying these methods makes it possible to identify their strengths when devising the marketing strategy and tactics of enterprises. The study highlighted a system of classical tools of digital marketing - search engine optimization, contextual advertising, social media marketing, technology of Big Data, retargeting, emailing. The essence, content, purpose, and scope of application of digital marketing tools were defined, which have emerged as a result of the latest technological innovations - native content, artificial intelligence, integration of marketing technologies, virtual and augmented reality, the Internet of Things, voice bots, voice, video and mobile marketing, affiliate marketing. Five strategies for the monetization of applications in mobile marketing have been identified. We have performed analysis of CPI-networks with a focus on mobile and non­motivated user traffic. We constructed a model of interaction between counterparties and the principles of an integrated approach to affiliate marketing projects, in particular, the need to find a reasonable, substantiated compromise plan has been shown. In this case, the task on choosing the optimal variant of a project is stated as a multicriteria optimization problem. We have analyzed methods for solving this problem and provide appropriate recommendations related to the choice of the most efficient method. The significance of the results obtained is predetermined by the fact that they could form a theoretical base for improving the effectiveness of marketing activity under conditions of the informatization of society through the use of appropriate strategies for monetization, better interaction between counterparties in affiliate marketing, identification of conditions for using the advantages and disadvantages of technological innovations of digital marketing.

"Joseph J., Sriram K.V., Rodrigues L.L.R., Mathew A.O., Gana K.C.",An empirical study on customer adoption of mobile payment application in India,2018,"Digital economy is becoming a reality. Business all over the world is moving towards digital platform and so is the payment option. Mobile application is becoming one of the easiest and fastest options for making payments and is predicted to have a very large potential in the days to come. This study focuses on the customer adoption of mobile payment application. The study reveals that the factors like usefulness, pervasiveness, ease of use, offers and cash back and service assume a vital role in encouraging adoption of mobile payment applications. Results show customers have greater preference towards mobile payment applications over the mobile web browsers, which is a clear sign of awareness among the customers. The study also showed that teenagers are more aggressive in embracing mobile payment application than the older age groups. Compared to other modes of payments, mobile payment with 14.5% preference among customers is low and there is a need for aggressive promotions and marketing campaigns. The study throws light into the customer adoption factors which can act as guidelines for improving customer adoption and awareness of mobile payment applications.

"Breytenbach J., Grové W.",Managing co-created design knowledge through ideation artefacts,2018,"With a Senian understanding of intellectual capital as being a function of agent capability and contextual resource constraints, the requirement for knowledge in the digital economy to be co-created by a network of agents is obvious. From network agents co-creating knowledge for the digital economy as a foundational point of departure, we problematize the management of this co-created knowledge. As network power shifts, so does the foundational capabilities and contexts. The problems caused by shifts in network power and agent capabilities become apparent in co-creative systems design processes such as Living Labs and popular Design Science frameworks. As the disruptive power of digital change creates shifts in the foundational design network's agency, knowledge is lost. We postulate that it is typically highly technical design knowledge - created at a high cost during co-creation - that is lost first. We present examples of technical design knowledge flowing out of the network from a local Smart Community design case. Towards the prevention of co-created design knowledge loss as a result of changes in the foundational network, we suggest the use of physical ideation artefacts for the storage, management, and continued dissemination of the knowledge within the network. We present a case study where local, co-created, technical, Smart Community design knowledge was stored explicitly as ideation artefacts called ""tech cards"" and retained over time within the network after highly disruptive shifts in the capability set of the foundational agent network responsible for the original knowledge creation. The co-creation of physical, knowledge-rich ideation artefacts as part of system design processes such as Living Labs shows promise as a Knowledge Management tool amidst fast paced digital change in the knowledge economy. © 2018 Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

Requena J.Á.G.,Tax treaty characterization of income derived from cloud computing and 3D printing and the Spanish approach,2018,"The digitalization of the economy is giving rise to several tax issues. Although some problems are typical and have been highlighted by tax experts for many years, with the tremendous growth of the digital economy they have only been exacerbated. Nevertheless, there are specific issues that have arisen due to the digitalization of the economy, such as the nexus issue for permanent establishments, the tax treatment of data collected through the Internet and the appropriate characterization of income derived from new business models. This article analyses the tax treatment of two of these models that are widespread, namely cloud-based services and 3D printing services. After noting the relevant characteristics of the tax issues, the article studies the treatment under tax treaties, taking into account the OECD Model Convention and the Commentary thereon, as well as the position of the Spanish tax administration. This study uses the tax treatment of software and digital products, as addressed in the Commentary on Article 12 of the OECD Model, and the Spanish Observation to that Commentary, in order to build a framework of the potential tax treatment among business profits, royalties and capital gains. Finally, the author defends the characterization of both cloud computing and 3D printing payments as a tool to align tax with the place of value creation through a new interpretation of the concept of royalties in the Commentary on the OECD Model following the approach of the Spanish tax administration. © 2018 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands.",

The paper identifies disruptive challenges for financial institutions need to adapt. The research investigates the value and the investment flows structure as most obvious indicators of FinTech and describes types of payments relationships there. The paper considers relationships between enterprises, financial institutions and individuals, which are formed in digital payments. To understand the difference between regular cross-border money transfers and P2P crossborder money transfers with TransferWise, both mechanisms were researched and the benefits underlined. For Ukraine, the improvement of existing cross-border payments system with FinTech is a crucial challenge. That is why it is important to focus on providing knowledge for people, supporting start-ups in the sector and learning the best implementation practices. A great example of cross-border payments of FinTech in Ukraine is TransferWise. The difference between regular cross-border money transfers and peer-to-peer (P2P) money transfers appears in its benefits, such as lower and more expectable transfer fee, mid-market exchange rate, less transaction period. By transforming existing cost structures and mitigating market imperfections, they provide innovative services that meet the users' needs for speed, trust, low cost, usability, security and transparency. The results show high potential of FinTech for cross-border payment processing. © Yuriy Petrushenko.",Digital economy; Financial innovations; Financial services; Financial sphere; Financial technologies; Payment methods; Start-up; Venture
"Gravili G., Benvenuto M., Avram A., Viola C.",The influence of the Digital Divide on Big Data generation within supply chain management,2018,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the influence of the Digital Divide (DD) and digital alphabetization (DA) on the Big Data (BD) generation process, to gain insight into how BD could become a useful tool in the decision-making process of supply chain management (SCM). Similarly, the paper aims to recognize and understand, from a value-creation perspective, the correlation between DD and BD generation and between DD and SCM. Design/methodology/approach: The approach utilized in the present study consists of two steps: first, a systematic literature review was conducted aiming at finding out to determine the existing relationship between “Big Data Analytics” (BDA), “SCM” and the “DD”. A total of 595 articles were considered, and analysis showed a clear relationship among BDA, SCM, and DD. Next, the Vector autoregressive (VAR) approach was applied in a case study to prove the correlation between DD (as part of internet usage) and internet acquisitions, and in general terms the relationship between DD and Trade. Internet usage and internet acquisition in imports and exports at the European level were considered as variables in an empirical study of European trade. The novelty of this two-tiered approach consists in its application of a systematic literature review, the first of its kind, to generate inputs for the longitudinal case study of imports and exports at the EU level. In turn, the case study tested the accuracy of the theorized relationship among the main variables. Findings: By analyzing the connection between DD and internet acquisitions, a positive and long-lasting impulse response function was revealed, followed by an ascending trend. This suggests that a self-multiplying effect is being generated, and it is reasonable to assume that the more individuals use the internet, the more electronic acquisitions occur. We can thus reasonably conclude that the improvement of the BD and SCM process is strongly dependent on the quality of the human factor. Tackling DA is the new reading key in the decision-making process: quantifying the added value of the human factor in SCM is challenging and is an ongoing process, based on the opportunity cost between automation in decision-making or relying on the complexity of human factors. Research limitations/implications: One of the biggest limits in our research is the lack of the time series available on consumer orientations and preferences. Data on the typology of customer preferences, and how they are shaped, modified, or altered, were non-accessible, though big companies may have access to this data. The present longitudinal study on European trade helps clarify how and to what extent BDA, SCM, and DD are inter-related. The modeling of the theoretical framework likewise highlights several identifiable benefits for companies of adopting BDA in their business processes. Practical implications: Understanding the obstacles to DD in trade companies and states, and identifying their influence on firm performance, serves to orient the decision-making process in SCM toward reducing DD to generate important economic benefits. Enhancing internet usage may accelerate longer-term investments in human resources, offering developing countries unprecedented opportunities to enhance their educational systems and to improve their economic policies, widening the range of opportunities for businesses and poor states. Social implications: BD generation will undeniably influence microeconomic decisions: they will become evaluation tools of more efficient economic progress in small and/or large economies. However, an economically efficient society will be achievable only in those countries in which qualified human resources can generate and manage BD, to unlock its potential. This twofold effect will surely affect the socio-economic and geopolitical situation. The economic progress of conventional countries may vacillate if it is not adequately flanked by qualified human resources able to progress the information and communication technology (ICT) prevalent in contemporary economies. Consequently, the social impact of investments in ICT capacity building will necessarily affect future socio-economic scenarios. New indicators will become necessary to measure the conventional progress, and one of them will surely be DD. Originality/value: The novelty of the present study is twofold: first, it is the first meticulous meta-analysis developed using a very wide analysis of the published literature to highlight a previously hidden relationship among DD, BD, and SCM. This comparative approach made it possible to build a theoretical framework for the real evaluation of the impact of BDA on different organizational elements, including SCM. Second, the research emphasizes the need to reform and reshape the studies on BDA, convincing companies that it is necessary to understand that the obstacles (DD and DA, i.e. internet usage) must be addressed with conscious decision-making processes, strategically and resolutely, to transform points of weakness into opportunities. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Buyer-supplier relationships; Case study; Europe; Management research; Performance measurements; Strategic management; Supply chain competences; Supply chain innovation

Rassadnev E.S.,Leading trends in development of higher education under globalization,2018,"The article is concerned with defining of leading trends in development of higher education under globalization and their influence on competitiveness of educational services. The theoretical and methodological basis of the research are the leading foreign scientists' works on formation of the educational services market under globalization of the world economy. The three leading trends in the development of education are singled out under globalization. Internationalization of higher education is a sign of the quality of service provision in the global market, which provides international mobility of students, teachers and researchers. Massification of higher education is a sign of the degree of availability of specific educational services in the global market to a wide range of potential consumers without any additional restrictions on ethnic, religious, social, gender and economic characteristics. Informatization of higher education becomes apparent in three definitions: as a qualitative characteristic of knowledge transfer from a subject to an object of a service through the use of IT-technologies; as a process of service transfer via global information space that provides speed, availability of services in space and time; as a systematic transformation in the industry of higher education based on new educational technologies built upon the tools of digital economy and developing under the impact of the global information society. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

"Kirton J.J., Warren B.",G20 governance of digitalization [Повестка дня «Группы двадцати» в области цифровизации],2018,"В рамках данной статьи проводится системный анализ деятельности «Группы двадцати» в сфере цифровизации по основным измерениям институциональной эффективности и делаются выводы относительно причин опре- деленных тенденций, складывающихся в этой связи [Kirton, 2013]. Авторы утверждают, что «двадцатка» по- степенно повышала свою эффективность в осуществлении функций глобального управления в цифровой сфере. С самого начала деятельности института в 2008 г. повестка дня в данной области постоянно расширялась, достигнув пика в 2016-2017 гг. Лидеры «Группы двадцати» впервые обратили внимание на вопросы цифровиза- ции вследствие глобального финансово-экономического кризиса 2008 г. На саммите в Вашингтоне была признана роль электронной торговли как важного инструмента борьбы с кризисом. Впоследствии стали обсуждаться и проблемы неравенства, лежащие в основе идеологии антиглобализма. Таким образом, был осуществлен переход от борьбы с последствиями кризиса к принятию превентивных мер. Тенденции расширения круга обсуждаемых вопросов и резкий рост их числа фиксируются по функциям определения направления действий, принятия реше- ний и институционального развития глобального управления, однако не отражаются на функциях реализации принятых решений. Данный тренд обусловлен шокирующим ростом популистских настроений, вызванным про- явлениями неравенства в Великобритании и США в 2015 и 2016 гг., а также провалом традиционных междуна- родных институтов, глобальным коллективным превосходством членов «двадцатки» и конвергенцией их отно- сительных возможностей в цифровой сфере и, наконец, консенсусом о приоритетном характере экономического роста и открытости. Важнейшим фактором, однако, стали интересы Китая, принимавшего форум в 2016 г., и Германии, председательствовавшей в 2017 г. Лидеры этих стран, заручившись политической поддержкой на национальном уровне, стремились сформировать цифровую повестку дня, обеспечивающую справедливое распре- деление благ цифровизации в противовес нарастающим популистским и протекционистским тенденциям. © OECD.This study systematically assesses the Group of 20 (G20) summit's performance on digitalization across the key dimensions and suggests what has caused its particular pattern of performance thus far [Kirton, 2013]. It argues that the G20 summit's digitalization governance has been increasingly successful. Its digitalization agenda steadily expanded since the beginning, with a major surge in 2016-17. G20 summits first addressed digitalization in response to the American-turned-global financial crisis of 2008. Then, G20 leaders acknowledged e-commerce as an important tool to manage the crisis. They then gradually expanded their agenda to finally focus on inequality, a root cause of antiglobalization. They thus moved from a crisis-response to a crisis-prevention approach. This spread and spike is seen in the G20's direction-setting, decision-making and institutional development of global governance, but not in its delivery of its decisions. This overall performance was driven partly by the shocking surge in populism bred by inequality in the UK and U.S. in 2015 and 2016, by the failure of the established multilateral organizations in response, by the global predominance and equalizing capabilities of G20 members in specialized digital capabilities and their convergence on the economic growth through openness that digitalization brought. Yet this performance flowed primarily from the hosting of economically reforming China in 2016 and export-oriented Germany in 2017, whose politically secure leaders sought to shape digitalization for the benefit of all in response to the rise of populism and protectionism in the UK and the United States. © OECD.",Antiglobalization; Causes of performance; Digital economy; Digitalization; Dimensions of performance; G20; Inequality; «Группа двадцати»; Антиглобализм; Неравенство; Факторы глобального управления; Факторы эффективности; Цифровая экономика; цифровизация
"Spiekermann M., Tebernum D., Wenzel S., Otto B.",A metadata model for data goods,2018,"Digital transformation implies the development of data-driven business models and thus the management of data goods. While marketplaces for data are being established and platforms for the exchange of data are being created, companies have to adapt their data management to the increasing requirements. One central question can be deduced: How can data goods be described in a standardized way? This paper describes the development of the metadata model for data goods M4DG. The M4DG, based on an analysis of existing data marketplaces and metadata models of related topics, makes it possible to describe data sources with defined properties. This creates a unified understanding of the properties of data goods to facilitate selection and trading. We are convinced that the M4DG will contribute to the practical design of data management. © 2018 Leuphana Universitat Luneburg.

Tassi P.,Introduction – The contributions of big data,2018,"The revolution, which is quite recent, brought about by digital convergence and connected objects, has enabled a homogenisation of data types which would historically have been considered as different, for example: digital data, texts, sound, still images, and moving images. This has encouraged the Big Data phenomenon, the volume of which includes two related parameters: quantity and frequency of acquisition; quantity can extend as far as exhaustivity and frequency can be up to and including real time. This Special Issue features a series of articles that examine its uses and implications, as well as the challenges faced by statistical production in general, and especially that of official statistics. Just like any innovation, Big Data offer advantages and raise questions. The obvious benefits include “added” knowledge – a better statistical description of the economy and the society. They are also a driver for development in computer science in the broadest sense, and in applied mathematics. However, we cannot do without some degree of vigilance, since data and how they are used can affect individuals, their freedoms and the preservation of their privacy. © 2018, Institut National de la Statistique et des Etudes Economiques.

Research of the main trends of innovative development of distributed generation demonstrated that they are characterized by high spending both on installation of innovative power equipment and on its creation. Our research of financing in the Russian distributed energy and power engineering demonstrated that the bulk of capital investment is done from companies’ own funds, which points to the unaffordability of other funding instruments, credit included. Consequently, the process of creating and using innovations in distributed energy is accompanied by significant investment risks. This scientific research offers an approach to innovations in distributed energy based on coordination of economic interests of innovation process subjects with the aim of optimizing the task of looking for a threshold price through defining and comparing the effectiveness of a novelty for its creators, consumers and the state with the help of an internal rate of return. The use of a business approach to the introduction of innovations in the distributed energy will coordinate the interests of the producer of innovative equipment and the energy company. Such an approach will ensure co-financing of innovation research and development of all subjects of the relations. © 2018, Econjournals.

"Rančák J., Strachota S.",Logistics challenges in industrial companies in the Czech Republic,2018,"Globalization, electronic trading, ever shortening life cycle of products, integrating customers into company processes, leaps in evolution of information and communication technology all cause changes in the economy. Companies need to follow these trends, if they want to maintain or expand their competitiveness. What contributes markedly to coping with the challenges resulting from these trends is logistics. The main trend in current logistics is the onset of digitization. Companies in the Czech Republic use digital form rather than paper much more frequently when managing their warehouse, inventory, cart and vehicle fleets, stocktaking, ordering freight, etc. This study discusses the position of logistics departments, and particularly the analysis of current as well as past challenges that these departments are or have been facing. For this purpose, a qualitative research in industrial companies was carried out and four hypotheses were subsequently formed.

Mandrescu D.,Applying (EU) competition law to online platforms: Reflections on the definition of the relevant market(s),2018,"Abuse of dominance cases under Article 102 TFEU concerning online platforms will require revisiting the process of the market definition in light of the complexities that are likely to arise due to the two- or multi-sided nature of such platforms. This distinctive nature will firstly require determining the number of relevant markets that need to be defined in each case before the scope of such markets can be accurately delineated. Unfortunately, however, the current approaches to this first, new step, of the market definition process are incompatible with business reality. Therefore this article provides an alternative approach to this complexity, which is better suited to guarantee the trueness of the market definition findings. Accordingly, this article indicates that the number of relevant markets in each case should be determined based on the typology of the interactions facilitated by the online platform and the degree of substitutability of such online platform with other non-platform undertakings from the perspective of its customers groups. This approach allows reaching findings of market power in a manner that adequately reflects the business reality of such platforms in the digital economy and the degree of competitive pressure they may experience in practice. © 2018 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands.",
Cousins B.,Design thinking: Organizational learning in VUCA environments,2018,"Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity and Ambiguity (VUCA) now defines the competitive environment of the digital economy in which organizations must adapt structures to match rapidly changing and more complex landscapes. Prior VUCA research identified frequent and rapid knowledge acquisition, pattern and trend recognition and cause and effect analysis as organizational learning imperatives which must be strategically considered. In response to increased disruption of VUCA environments, design thinking has gained popularity and widespread acceptance as a method to facilitate speed and frequency of organizational learning. This study approached design thinking from an absorptive capacity perspective to describe and document the perspectives of subject matter experts on how design thinking promotes organizational learning in VUCA environments. The present findings reveal design thinking learning structures increase the speed and efficiency of absorptive capacity and organizational learning. In return, this increased speed and efficiency results in faster decision making and innovation to pre-empt disruptive VUCA environments. As such, this study advocates for a re-conceptualization of design thinking from a problem solving and innovation construct into an organizational learning construct. This re-conceptualization will aide in removing vague definition and ambiguity from the concept while allowing for richer theory building and broader application of design thinking in a variety of contexts. © 2018, Allied Academies.",Absorptive capacity; Ambiguous; Complex; Disruption; Organizational learning; Uncertain; Volatile
"Salampasis D., Mention A.-L.",FinTech: Harnessing Innovation for Financial Inclusion,2018,"The landscape of financial inclusion has for long been considered as the soft side of financial services, having received scarce attention from a financial, regulatory, and policy point of view, despite its central role within the global economic empowerment. Part of the disadvantaged and low-income segments of global population is left without (i.e. financially excluded) or very limited access (i.e. financially underserved) to basic financial services, creating a highly critical equality deficit in different parts of the world. In this frame of reference, financial exclusion still remains a highly critical problem that hinders developing regions around the world from eradicating poverty leading to large-scale starvation and civil unrest. Moreover, financial exclusion is interwoven with social dependency making financially excluded/underserved populations strongly dependable on their social networks. The emergence of FinTech, the new breed between financial innovation and financial technology, which has been challenging the prevailing position of incumbent financial institutions, is providing a promising vehicle of tackling this phenomenon by closing the gap between unbanked, under-banked and developed societies, opening the door to the global digital economy, bringing a long-term societal transformational change for the financially excluded/underserved, while leading to inclusive economic growth helping move towards a more just and equitable society. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

"Bressanelli G., Perona M., Saccani N.",Towards the circular supply chain: A literature review of challenges,2018,"The notion of Circular Economy (CE) has been arisen as a promising approach to promote sustainability without compromising economic growth. However, companies who are going to redesign their supply chain to adopt the CE paradigm face several challenges. Despite their relevance in such an early stage of CE practices adoption by companies, literature still lacks a systemic and holistic identification of this set of challenges. In fact, previous research either focused on a particular industrial sector, on a geographical context, on a specific firm category or by limiting the analysis to only some CE aspect. Therefore, this paper carries out a literature review to identify the main challenges that companies have to face when they want to redesign their supply chain according to CE principles, i.e. to implement a circular supply chain. As much as 24 challenges have been identified and classified in accordance with the life cycle phase(s) affected and the CE lever(s) touched as recognized in literature, i.e. product redesign, servitised business models, reverse logistics and system enablers (e.g. legislation or digital 4.0 technologies). Findings highlight the multidisciplinary character of CE, and show that the challenges are quite distributed among the different life cycle phases, implying that companies who desire to implement a circular supply chain should be prepared to face challenges related to both the direct and the reverse flows of materials, despite the common thinking that CE is only related to reverse logistics. Moreover, findings show that a non-negligible number of challenges arises within each CE lever, thus confirming the need for a systemic and holistic approach. Managers may use the set of challenges to prevent likely barriers that arise in the transition towards CE. © 2018 AIDI - Italian Association of Industrial Operations Professors.

Currently the predominant role belongs to the first one, but in the conditions of the digital economy development it is the mathematical one. It should be noted that the importance of commercial secrets prevent the transition to the information flows transparency while significant decrease of the legal accounting aspect can lead to certain quality deterioration of the accounting information. The main idea of this article is not only to discover the negative aspects connected with the weakening of legal accounting aspects, but also to show possible options of modern legal issues and implementations into the accounting practice. One of the main theoretical and methodological problems in this area is the intensive expansion of the multivariate accounting, based on professional judgment, which decreases the accounting procedures’ regulatory role. The authors consider necessary to propose a harmonious and balanced system of informational enrichment of public institutions’ activity of all the ties between the taxation process and its accounting support. As a result of this research, the authors came to the conclusion to structure formal and informal institutions that could influence the organization of accounting at a particular economic level moving from the advisory options of the accounting policy to the elements of discrete financial and business law based on the development of internal standards of economic entities. © 2018 International Strategic Management Association.

"Shulin Z., Chienliang K.",How social media are changing nonprofit advocacy: Evidence from the crowdfunding platform in Taiwan,2018,"How nonprofit organizations (NPO) utilize social media to engage in advocacy work is regarded as one of the most important challenges in the digital economy era. However, although current studies pay their attention to how NPO react to the prevalence of social media, less focus is paid on how social media help to shape NPO's practices on advocacy work. To help close the gap between theory and practice, this research explores whether the alignment between NPO's advocacy practices and features of social media determine the NPO's usage on social media. In particular, how the crowdfunding platform, an emerging and powerful form of social media, is used by NPO is investigated. Those crowdfunding projects initiated by NPO in FlyingV, the most well-known crowdfunding platform in Taiwan, are taken as the data source for analysis in this paper. The findings reveal that crowdfunding platforms are beneficial to NPO in turns of gaining resources and attracting participants, which then fostering the realization of advocacy activities. As well, the efficiency of crowdfunded projects (or advocacy proposals) is mainly determined by the number of participants (or sponsors). However, based on the findings, it is argued that NPO so far have not realized the power of crowdfunding platforms, thus not yet regarding crowdfunding platforms as key social media or strategic weapons in strengthening their impact or contribution on advocacy work relevant to their missions. © koninklijke brill nv, leiden, 2018.",Crowdfunding; Nonprofit organization; Policy advocacy; Social media

One of the most critical challenges faced by SMEs today is Talent Management. The term Talent Management entails Acquisition, Retention and Motivation of the employees, implicating that the first real challenge for SMEs today is acquiring a human asset; upon acquisition, keep them there is another challenge, and if both these states are met, SMEs are unable to motivate the human asset. This paper develops a proposition of using social media as a means of talent management. Generally, social media is associated with marketing only, while this paper produces the concept of utilizing social media for talent management practices. Research has been conducted using a blend of Primary Research (in-depth interviews) and Secondary Research (review of the existing literature). The outcomes are interesting; amongst the traditional and modern thoughts about digital media in Asia, the organizations that are using social media for enhancing the efficiency of their talent management function are finding it exceptionally useful and effective. Their practices can be implicated at a wider scale and can be effectively utilized by other SMEs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Butnaru I.,Profit shifting: Evidence from the Romanian IT sector,2018,"The purpose of this article is to investigate the profit shifting. Thus, the author choose to investigate the behavior of the companies involved in the provision of IT services that are member of a Group. In the age of digitalization, when many companies need IT assistance, it is very unlikely that companies involved in provision of such services to incur recurrent losses, mainly when such companies works only for other Group entities. Thus, as a first step, the author identified the companies located in Romania members of a multinational Group, that activate in the IT sector and that incur recurrent losses. Further, the author compared the profit margin obtained by thus companies with the profit margin obtained by comparable independent companies, as defined by the Romanian legislation. In addition, the author estimated the level of the revenues that should have been obtained by companies' member of a Group in case the transfer pricing principles were observed. The result of this analysis, reveals good news, more specifically, during the period 2011 -2016 the deviation of the revenues derived by multinational companies that activate in the IT sector from the market level is decreasing, which may indicate that the multinational companies are more prudent when setting the intercompany prices. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The theoretical interpretation of the process of cryptocurrencies occurrence in the context of definitions of electronic funds and virtual payment services is carried out. Cryptocurrencies show impressive dynamics of growth, but this is due to the rapidly growing public interest, which provokes demand in the market and limits supply. The study clarifies the growth factors of the cryptocurrency, gives an assessment of the prospects and forecasts various scenarios for the cryptocurrency system development. In the course of the correlationregression analysis of the Bitcoin price dynamics, it is determined that the observations approximations best correspond to the polynomial model of the third degree and the exponential model. For both of them, the determination coefficient is close to the boundaries of the confidence interval. Based on the analysis of the Bitcoin market price dynamics, it is concluded that the demand for cryptocurrency has been formed not by its intrinsic value, but by market expectations, as well as by the level of interest and involvement of participants in this virtual network (via network effect). Based on the example of the financial market, it is shown that the possibilities of blockchain technology are versatile.

Talvard F.,Can urban “miracles” be engineered in laboratories?: Turning medellín into a model city for the Global South,2018,"“How did the ‘Medellín miracle’ happen? And what can it teach other cities?"", a 2014 article from The Economist began by asking. 1 Mayors, planners and consultants around the world are preoccupied by these two questions (“how did other cities solve certain issues and what can be learnt from it?"") and they have learned to seek the benefits of a “model city” status. Medellín did not become an example by accident, nor through the long historic sedimentation that made other cities paragons of urban governance or innovation: positioning Medellín as an international exemplar is an ongoing, experimental project that fits into a “smart” city agenda. This chapter seeks to make sense of growing discourses about urban exemplars and the best practices of “smart” urbanism, specifically in the context of so-called developing countries. The literature on “smart” cities tends to be polarized between superlative discourses anticipating a technologically optimized democratic panacea and critical research that sometimes assumes cities have little agency, falling prey to the corporate interests of the digital economy (Hollands 2015). The goal of this chapter is to enrich our collective critical understanding of smart urbanism by analysing a case that requires rethinking those critical poles. As cities all over the world appropriate the discourses and practices of “smart” urban innovation, questions arise such as: How do smart urbanism projects fit into development narratives and adjust to places in the Global South? Does it mean standardization or diversity? How is the tension between universalist smart programmes and local idiosyncrasies managed in order to position Medellín as an “urban laboratory for the Global South”. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Claudio Coletta, Leighton Evans, Liam Heaphy and Rob Kitchin.",
"Witoszek N., Midttun A.",Sustainable modernity: The nordic model and beyond,2018,"In the 21st century, Norway, Denmark and Sweden remain the icons of fair societies, with high economic productivity and quality of life. But they are also an enigma in a cultural-evolutionary sense: though by no means following the same socio-economic formula, they are all cases of a “non-hubristic”, socially sustainable modernity that puzzles outside observers. Using Nordic welfare states as its laboratory, Sustainable Modernity combines evolutionary and socio-cultural perspectives to illuminate the mainsprings of what the authors call the “well-being society”. The main contention is that Nordic uniqueness is not merely the outcome of one particular set of historical institutional or political arrangements, or sheer historical luck; rather, the high welfare creation inherent in the Nordic model has been predicated on a long and durable tradition of social cooperation, which has interacted with global competitive forces. Hence the socially sustainable Nordic modernity should be approached as an integrated and tightly orchestrated ecosystem based on a complex interplay of cooperative and competitive strategies within and across several domains: normative-cultural, socio-political and redistributive. The key question is: Can the Nordic countries uphold the balance of competition and cooperation and reproduce their resilience in the age of globalization, cultural collisions, the digital economy, the fragmentation of the work/life division and often intrusive EU regulation? With contributors providing insights from the humanities, the social sciences and evolutionary science, this book will be of great interest to students and scholars of political science, sociology, history, institutional economics, Nordic studies and human evolution studies. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Nina Witoszek and Atle Midttun.",
Islam I.,Automation and the future of employment: Implications for India,2018,"This article reviews the international evidence on the impact of automation on employment and interprets the Indian experience in light of such evidence. It argues that the apocalyptic notion that one faces large-scale technological unemployment either in India or globally is exaggerated. On the other hand, the romantic notion that new technology-especially in the form of on-line work- will create a new era of prosperity in India driven by digitally-enabled microentrepreneurs is unlikely to materialize. This does not mean that new employment opportunities created by digital platforms should be shunned. They should be carefully nurtured by novel regulatory frameworks that seek to improve wages and working conditions for the growing community of online workers in India. This should be complemented by adequate investments in digital infrastructure. © 2018 Sage Publications India Private Limited.",Automation; Digitalization; India; Self-employment; Sharing economy; Technological unemployment
"Unnikrishnan A., Nagappan M.",Virtual permanent establishments: Indian law and practice,2018,"The virtual permanent establishment (virtual PE) was first proposed to tackle growing concerns that multinationals could artificially avoid PE status by rendering cross border supplies of goods and services through electronic means. The virtual PE concept therefore sought to link taxation with value creation: in most cases, this involved the application of source taxation to non-resident entities that had no physical presence in the source state. With increasing digitalization, the virtual PE concept has become crucial to addressing tax avoidance and base erosion, particularly by multinational enterprises and cross border suppliers of goods and services. This article1 traces the evolution and treatment of the virtual PE concept under Indian law against the background of the broad framework prescribed under international and comparative tax law. Based on an analysis of Indian judicial precedents on the topic, the authors believe that Indian courts have progressively watered down the requirements necessary to trigger the existence of a PE. Although the lowering of thresholds is in the context of digital businesses where the courts have sought to tax income in India through any tangible or physical nexus, the lower thresholds could arguably be applied in other situations. Furthermore recent reservations by India to the revised OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital (OECD Model) and changes in the domestic tax laws introduced in the 2018 Budget also indicate an intent to lower the threshold for the creation of nexus, for both digital and other businesses operating in the Indian market. This potentially raises the level of uncertainty with regard to many transactions which, in the past, were not questioned as being undertaken by a PE and which may, in certain instances, lead to absurd results. Additionally, the struggle between adopting a multilateral solution such as the virtual PE appears to be slowly giving way to uncoordinated and unilateral levies, such as India's recent equalization levy. Several European countries are now considering similar unilateral measures. This would lead to double taxation, have a chilling effect on cross border trade, and undercut the foundation of the international tax order by bypassing a stable and clear treaty network. Therefore, there is a need to address the complexity of the concept of a virtual PE and achieve consensus before the world crosses a tipping point, after which unilateral solutions may become the norm. From an Indian perspective as well, this is crucial if India is to achieve its publicly stated goal of a USD 1 trillion digital economy in the next four years.2. © 2018 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands.",
Goos M.,The impact of technological progress on labour markets: Policy challenges,2018,"This paper gives an overview of current thinking by economists about the consequences of ongoing technological progress for labour markets, and discusses policy implications. In economics, the impact of technological progress on labour markets is understood by the following two channels: (i) the nature of interactions between differently skilled workers and new technologies affecting labour demand and (ii) the equilibrium effects of technological progress through consequent changes in labour supply and product markets. The paper explains how the ongoing Digital Revolution is characterized by a complex interplay between worker skills and digital capital in the workplace, and consequent changes in job mobility for workers and in output prices affecting consumer demand for goods and services. In particular, it explains how current worker-technology interactions and the equilibrium effects they entail combine to create economy-wide job polarization with winners and losers from ongoing technological progress. The paper therefore concludes by discussing a set of policy interventions to ensure that the benefits of the Digital Revolution are broadly shared. © The Author 2018.",Occupational choice; Policy; Technological progress
"Nesterova L., Sukhikh E., Kuzmin M., Sazonova M.",Evaluation of the implementation effectiveness of the company strategic initiatives on the example of product portfolio planning optimization,2018,"In the era of the digital economy, the successful implementation of the company's strategic initiatives is increasingly influenced by a wise investment in the organization's own personnel, in the human capital that it has accumulated. The presence of this component, which is the main component of any business process, contributes to the implementation of the company's business ideas. The problem field in this case is the ability of the company's top management, on the one hand, to correctly evaluate the efficiency of the company's divisions, and competently motivate and stimulate its staff to implement the proposed mechanism for assessing the projected risks and market growth in sales by commodity groups, on the other. The purpose of the study is to develop a methodology for calculating the return on investment in human capital and assessing the effectiveness of its activities based on the created mathematical model for calculating the statistical indicators of profit accounting for the formation of the company's product portfolio. Using the company's value management concept based on the EVA indicator for making management decisions, we proposed to use the coefficients of Intellectual Return and Human Capacity, which allow us to estimate the return on investment in the company's human capital. In order to assess the effectiveness of the use of human capital and the adoption of management decisions in this area, we have developed a methodical approach to assessing the effectiveness of management decisions in the formation, use, and development of human capital. Analytical value of this technique is that it allows identifying the emergence of risks that can reduce all activities in the field of human capital management to naught.

"Hänninen M., Smedlund A., Mitronen L.",Digitalization in retailing: multi-sided platforms as drivers of industry transformation,2018,"Purpose: Digitalization has transformed several industries during the past two decades. In this paper the authors focus on the retail sector, where new business models help retailers and suppliers meet the ever changing and demanding needs of retail shoppers. One example of this business model innovation is multi-sided digital platforms, which have become popular as they connect consumers with suppliers from around the world with a large ecosystem to support the retail platform. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of how multi-sided digital platforms are transforming the retail exchange logic and assess the implications and impact of these platform-based businesses on the retail sector, especially for business managers and consumers. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the authors employ literature review, conceptual analysis and qualitative case study methodology. The authors provide an overview of how the platform economy is affecting the retail sector through the illustration of four digital multi-sided platforms: Alibaba Group, Amazon.com, eBay and Rakuten Group, and what differentiates them from incumbent business models in retailing. Findings: The findings suggest that platforms transform the transaction logic of retailing as they simply intermediate transactions between buyers and suppliers rather than handling the entire supply and logistics chain themselves. The authors highlight the role of consumer understanding and Big Data as one example of how multi-sided digital platforms differentiate from their non-platform competitors. Practical implications: The paper highlights how incumbent retailers can compete against new forms of business, such as digital platforms, and the authors demonstrate some of the managerial capabilities needed to remain relevant amidst this new digital competition. Originality/value: Very little empirical studies in marketing and retail literature have focused on multi-sided digital platforms and their business models. The present study fills this gap with an overview of how multi-sided digital platforms transform the retail sector. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Business model; Business strategy; Industry transformation; Multi-sided platforms; Platforms; Retailing
"Hotchkiss G., Lee Kuo Chuen D.",From the Ground Up: The Financial Inclusion Frontier,2018,"Recent innovations in fintech and blockchain technology have captured the imaginations of people around the world, and the attention of the banking world. As everyone prepares for a new era in Digital Banking and Internet Finance, now is a uniquely opportune moment to harness the power of innovation for an undisputed good: Financial Inclusion. Starting with M-PESA in Kenya, innovations in financial inclusion have been instrumental in bringing financial services to those that need it the most. At this moment, fintech innovation and financial inclusion are meeting in an unlikely place: Myanmar. After emerging from decades of isolation and economic mismanagement under military rule, Myanmar now has the fastest growing economy in Southeast Asia, and, uniquely, the 52 million people that live in the country are gaining access to the latest technology for the first time. At this exciting point in Myanmar's history, there is an opportunity for true digital leapfrogging for financial inclusion.

"Buyst E., Goos M., Salomons A.",Job polarization: An historical perspective,2018,"This paper uses historical labour market data for Belgium for the period 1846-2011 to illustrate how the employment impacts of the ongoing Digital Revolution after 1980 compare to those of the Second Industrial Revolution before 1980. Our analyses show that the period 1846-1947 was characterized by economy-wide skill-upgrading due to an increase in the demand for skilled relative to unskilled workers because of skill-biased technological change (SBTC). The period 1947-81 is characterized by particularly high labour market turbulence, in part due to a gradual switch from economywide skill-upgrading to job polarization. Consequently, the impact of the ongoing Digital Revolution on labour markets after 1980 is not uniquely characterized by exceptionally high labour market turbulence but by the nature of changes in the composition of jobs, namely a process of job polarization. To explain job polarization, the paper discusses the hypothesis of Routine-Biased Technological Change (RBTC) that has recently emerged in the academic literature. © The Author 2018.",Historical census data; Job polarization; Technological change

Rachidi L.,The availability of injunctive relief under EU and US law for FRANDencumbered patents,2018,"Although seeking an injunction might be a legitimate tool, threatening a willing licensee with an injunction to extract excessive royalties can be abusive under competition law. In these cases, patentees abuse their market power by using injunctive remedies to avoid their FRAND commitment. Even where an injunction might not be anti-competitive, proportionality considerations might still make the injunction inappropriate. Therefore, it is important for courts in Europe to consider the principles of proportionality and equity, and as underlined by the recent Communication from the European Commission, the impact injunctions can have on businesses, consumers and on the public interest. In the coming digital economy, it will become even more important that courts consider the relative relevance of the disputed technology for the application in question and the potential spillover effects of an injunction on third parties before granting injunctive relief. © 2018 Institute of Competition Law.Bien que le recours à une injonction puisse être légitime, une telle pratique peut être abusive au regard du droit de la concurrence lorsqu'elle a pour fin d'imposer des conditions injustifiées à un preneur de licence potentiel disposé à conclure une licence à des conditions équitables, raisonnables et non discriminatoires (Fair, Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory - FRAND). Dans ce cas, la demande d'injonction constitue un abus de position dominante contraire à l'engagement FRAND du titulaire du brevet essentiel à une norme. Même lorsque le recours à une injonction ne nuit pas à la concurrence, des considérations de proportionnalité peuvent rendre l'outil inapproprié. Par conséquent, il est essentiel que les tribunaux européens tiennent compte des principes de proportionnalité et d'équité et, comme le souligne une récente communication de la Commission européenne, de l'impact que les injonctions peuvent avoir sur les entreprises, les consommateurs et l'intérêt général.

"Veress J., Bagirova A.",Parental labour: Labour market acceptance driven by civil activism,2018,"There are global demographic tensions generated by ageing and increasingly shrinking population in developed economies, and rapid population growth (especially in young cohorts) in developing countries. Although these challenging trends would require enhanced social support for parents and parenting increasingly robust and sophisticated austerity policies roll back existing social services, decompose the very idea of the welfare state. As social activism, including feminist and gender movements argue the parental labour must be reflected in statistics and incorporated into economy and Economics together with household activities and other traditionally neglected forms of (often primarily social) value creation. In developed and transition countries there is growing interest toward and recognition of the parental work as the analysis of empirical data collected in Russia indicate. 1) The parenting is work upon majority of responding students and young adults as surveys and case studies point out. These institutional changes are in line with broader tendencies appearing among volunteers participating in civil society organizations carrying out multi-coloured activities. 2) The parental labour is characterized by similar, often contradictory effects and trends as any other (type of) work in developed countries. Parents have to mobilize increasingly sophisticated and expensive skilled work, involve more and more experts in order to ensure their children's sound physical, intellectual, moral, artistic development. The interplay between stagnation of the labour income, ageing and decline of the population drives growing participation of women in salaried jobs by decreasing their time and energy available for parental work. 3) The analysis of the parental labour requires combining multi-disciplinary and process approach with methodological pluralism. The exploration of the parental work and its potential labour market acceptance requires considering broader tendencies, including (potential impacts of) the activism of civil society providing its capacity of social agency. The younger generations perceive parenting as labour and important mechanism of value creation. They are aware of the focal aspects of civil activism, including the significance of gender issues, the importance to overcome and prevent further growth of inequality in context of digitalization, and to facilitate cooperative, sharing, and genuinely sustainable trends during the emergence of a knowledge driven-society. © The Authors, 2018.

Focardi S.M.,"Money: What it is, how it’s created, who gets it, and why it matters",2018,"By enabling the storage and transfer of purchasing power, money facilitates economic transactions and coordinates economic activity. But what is money? How is it generated? Distributed? How does money acquire value and that value change? How does money impact the economy, society? This book explores money as a system of ""tokens"" that represent the purchasing power of individual agents. It looks at how money developed from debt/credit relationships, barter and coins into a system of gold-backed currencies and bank credit and on to the present system of fiat money, bank credit, near-money and, more recently, digital currencies. The author successively examines how the money circuit has changed over the last 50 years, a period of stagnant wages, increased household borrowing and growing economic complexity, and argues for a new theory of economies as complex systems, coordinated by a banking and financial system. Money: What It Is, How It’s Created, Who Gets It and Why It Matters will be of interest to students of economics and finance theory and anyone wanting a more complete understanding of monetary theory, economics, money and banking. © 2018 Sergio M.

Midttun A.,Challenges to the nordic work model in the age of globalized digitalization,2018,"This chapter reviews some of the major challenges to the Nordic model as the global economy has evolved from industrial mass production towards information technology based on flexible specialization. It also discusses how the Nordic countries can meet these challenges while reinventing the Nordic model for the globalized age. The chapter focuses especially on the transition from an industrial to a service-based economy; the demanding confrontation with digital sharing and robotization; the pressure exerted by liberalization and Europeanization; and the challenges posed by new forms of industrial organization. The discussion is presented in the form of a scenario analysis, with three alternative trajectories: “Dualization”, “Resilience” and “Transformation”. Dualization represents a shift of the Nordic model toward a neoliberal direction with more “unfiltered” international market pressure, which increases inequalities, while the Nordic social contract and welfare arrangements weaken. Resilience represents a continuation of the Nordic model through the development of new alternatives to old working arrangements that have been overrun by liberalization, and combining them with the elements of the “classic model” that still work. Transformation goes beyond the dualism and resilience scenarios in factoring in the Nordic model’s exposure to radical technological innovation. This scenario explores the model’s assets and capabilities to meet new challenges and dilemmas. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Nina Witoszek and Atle Midttun.",
"Karachalios K., McCabe K.",Dual Use of Standardization Strategies: Promoting Regional Integration and/or Global Markets,2018,"This chapter discusses how the instruments of standards and standardization, international trade agreements, and government or public policy could collectively help foster economic growth, enhance prosperity through productivity increase, and drive innovation, without raising new protectionist barriers. These instruments should be used in an effective way to empower innovation across borders for an ecologically and socially sustainable prosperity, as - in the same time - the technological, social, and economic landscapes are undergoing tectonic shifts through: the rapid rate of technological development and convergence, particularly in the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector; increased competition and blurring of boundaries in the digital economy, driven by extensive global connectivity as well as the emergence of global innovation networks and new innovation hubs; national and regional policies having moved to coordinated broader digital approaches aiming at integrating social and economic priorities; and growing challenges affecting cross-border goods and information flow and their impact on individuals' rights to a minimal respect of their private sphere in a world of data-driven innovation. This chapter will illustrate a potential path for improvement, taking into consideration the current state-of-play of standards regimes, international and megaregional trade agreements, and government policies paradigms. One example that this chapter will discuss is that open technology platforms, such as standards developed in a globally open and inclusive, collaborative, and consensus manner, that could be voluntarily adopted and be thus applicable globally, should be explicitly considered in megaregional agreements. Temptations to use megaregional dynamics to promote ""regional standards"" and ""export"" them globally or use them as a tool to seal the regional market from competition, would create counterforces and could eventually lead to the end of the current globalization era. So, while megaregionals could pose a threat for the openness of future ICT platforms, including open compatibility, and interoperability standards, they offer also an opportunity for the above-mentioned types of standards and processes to be recognized. They could foster an evolution in the definition of what constitutes an ""international standard"" and ""international standards body."" The current definitions stem from an era where only a nation-centric standardization model existed, perpetuating thus a concept that predates and is not adequate for the Internet era, and which may lead to national or regional industrial policies with new forms of structural discrimination and protectionism. The chapter will discuss how international and megaregional trade agreements could be used to promote globally open standardization processes and their outcomes, as well as supportive regulations, as means to increase economic activity and social inclusiveness in several regions by enhancing cross-border innovation and trade without - at least formal - discriminations across regions. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Co.

Ibeh K.I.N.,Why do African multinationals invest outside their home region? Should they?,2018,"This study draws on preliminary case evidence to explore the motivations and advisability of engagement by African multinational enterprises (MNEs) in outward foreign direct investment (FDI) activities outside their home region. It complements recent research on MNEs from emerging markets, focused on the BRICS (Brazil, the Russian Federation, India, China, and South Africa) economies, with virtually no attention to potentially important players from rising Africa. The MNEs explored in this study are active in the energy, manufacturing, construction, chemicals, agribusiness, extractive/mining, and financial services sectors, and they have investment footprints both in countries in the North and the South. Their investment decisions are motivated by the search for market opportunities, strategic assets/resources and performance-boosting relationships, though more advanced economies appear to attract more strategic asset-seeking FDI from African MNEs. The paper argues that intra-regional investments by African MNEs should continue to be prioritized, but selective and strategic extra-regional FDI, undertaken with an eye on furthering global competitiveness, also requires appropriate policy support. This seems even more sensible given that the acceleration of borderless digital internationalization and the increasingly blurred nationality of MNE affiliates are lessening the relevance of regional distinctions.",Africa; Extra-regional FDI footprints; Foreign direct investment; Multinational enterprises

The programme has important aspect of information security and implementation of IT policy which supports e-Governance in a focused approach of Mission Mode. In this context, there is a need to assess situation of the programme which covers a study of initiatives and actions taken by various actor involved and processes which are responsible for overall e-Governance. Therefore, the purpose of this case study is to develop a Situation-Actor-Process (SAP), Learning-Action-Performance (LAP) based inquiry model to synthesize situation of information security governance, IT policy and overall e-Governance. Design/methodology/approach: In this case study both systematic inquiry and matrices based SAP-LAP models are developed. Actors are classified who are found responsible and engaged in IT policy framing, infrastructure development and also in e-Governance implementation. Based on a synthesis of SAP components, various LAP elements were then synthesized then which further led to learning from the case study. Suitable actions and performance have also been highlighted, followed by a statement of the impact of the efficacy i.e. transformation of information security, policy and e-Governance on the Digital India programme. Findings: On developing the SAP-LAP framework, it was found that actors like the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology of the Govt. of India secures a higher rank in implementing various initiatives and central sector schemes to accelerate the agenda of e-Governance. Actions of other preferred actors include more investments in IT infrastructure, policy development and a mechanism to address cyber security threats for effective implementation of e-Governance. It was found that actors should be pro-active on enhancing technical skills, capacity building and imparting education related to ICT applications and e-Governance. Decision making should be based on the sustainable management practices of e-Governance projects implementation to manage change, policy making and the governmental process of the Indian administration and also to achieve Sustainable Development Goals by the Indian economy. Research limitations/implications: The SAP-LAP synthesis is used to develop the case study. However, few other qualitative and quantitative multi criteria decision making approaches could also be explored for the development of IT security based e-Governance framework in the Indian context. Practical implications: The synthesis of SAP leads to LAP components which can bridge the gaps between information security, IT policy governance and e-Governance process. Based on the learning from the Situation, it is said that the case study can provide decision making support and has impact on the e-Governance process i.e. may enhance awareness about e-services available to the general public. Such work is required to assess the transparency and accountability on the Government. Social implications: Learning based on the SAP-LAP framework could provide decision making support to the administrators, policy makers and IT sector stakeholders. Thus, the case study would further help in addressing the research gaps, accelerating e-Governance initiatives and in capturing cyber threats. Originality/value: The SAP-LAP model is found as an intuitive approach to analyze the present status of information security governance, IT policy and e-Governance in India in a single unitary model. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Digital India; e-Governance; ICT Applications; Information security; IT policy; Sap-Lap

The necessary conditions for the creation and successful development of information technology centers have been identified; those conditions include the availability of free resources for electricity generation, a developed research and educational center and the human resources potential of the territory in the field of ICT (Information and Communication Technologies). Partially identified imbalances are associated with the multistructural nature of the Russian economy and with territorial expanse; they are objective in nature and are subject to adjustment. The expediency of creation of interregional system involving cooperation ties with the purpose to develop information technology centers in different regions of Russia is shown. © 2018 Academic Research Publishing Group.",Digital technologies; Economic choice; Information systems; Regional development; Regions; Sustainable development
Gareev T.R.,Platform markets: Their place in the theory of mesoeconomic system: Development and a challenge to spatial studies,2018,"Over the past three decades, researchers across different disciplines have paid close attention to the development of platform markets - an emergent longterm trend in economic policy. I consider platform markets as institutional and technological systems. Platforms create systems of rules and mechanisms that stimulate agents to adopt, maintain, and improve standards disseminated by the most successful platforms. Similarly to economic zones and clusters, platform markets are two-factor mesoeconomic systems. In this article, I consider the differences between two-factor systems and traditional one-factor groupings (agglomerations, industries, and conglomerates). I present a general theoretical framework for studying two-factor mesoeconomic systems, which is employed in a comparative analysis. A specific feature of platforms is the contribution of digital technology to the formalisation of relevant external effects and institutions, whereas economic zones are characterised by the external effects of agglomeration and clusters - by locally specific effects. Platforms are replacing economic zoning and clustering on the research agenda. © Gareev T.

Sinnig J.,The reflection of data-driven value creation in the 2018 OECD and EU proposals,2018,"Is the current corporate tax system fit for the digitalized economy? The 2018 interim report of the OECD and the proposals of the European Commission on the introduction of significant digital presence and a digital services tax give new insights into policymakers' perception of 'value creation' and income generation in digitalized business models. Although the right way to tax digitalized business models seems disputed with regard to the diverging outcomes of the OECD's and European Commission's work so far, it seems to be of common understanding that user data are susceptible of establishing a taxable nexus. In a first step, this article aims at analysing how the collection and processing of user data may create such genuine link between an income generating activity and a state territory enabling this state to exercise its taxing right. In that respect, the concept of value creation, a driving concept in the discussion on how to tax digitalized businesses, is critically reviewed and an attempt to understand its real meaning is presented. In a second step, the article analyses to which extent the long- and short-term proposals of the European Commission reflect such data-driven (taxable) value creation, critically highlighting their main characteristics and flaws. © 2018 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands.",

"Kennedy D., Rogers D., Huston M.",Maybe things really are different this time,2018,"Peter Drucker maintained there is a tendency for people to believe their situation is unique and a new world is dawning. He cautioned against this view and to look back to similar situations for guidance to analyze the present. Proven management tools and the underlying basic principles will continue to hold true. Drucker’s stance was demonstrated when the claim of a new economy in 1929 fell flat and again when the dotcom bubble burst after 2000. Both events saw a return to the realities of sound managerial principles. However, in 2018 there seems to be a case for things really being different this time. A review of cornerstones of engineering management practice reveals that their relevance may be decreasing due to fundamental changes in the organizational world. The current engineering management body of knowledge might be left behind in a rapidly changing business environment. Evidence through literature reviews, case studies and tours of modern businesses supports the view that the old standards are losing their importance. Subjects of much EM research highlighted in this paper are productivity, motivation, team work, continuous improvement, learning curves and organizational knowledge. Also, is there a potential for bitcoin or other digital currencies to disrupt the bases of engineering economy? Will even the world of engineering management education be disrupted by online courses reducing the need for teaching faculty? The engineering management world may soon find itself scrambling to regain lost relevance and credibility. © Copyright© (2018) by American Society for Engineering Management (ASEM).

Derevianko O.,Stakeholder engagement to replace traditional activities in reputation management system: Insights from Ukrainian food processing companies,2018,"Engaging stakeholders in reputation management processes in the digital economy, including through the use of their activity on the Internet and social networks, is a way to reduce the irrational reputation-support activity of the company's management and staff. Given the empirical research data (sociological survey) on the Ukrainian food processing companies, the article analyzes stakeholder engagement to replace traditional activities of the company's management and personnel in the reputation management system. As a result, the author's hypothesis was proved that the natural development (increasing the maturity level) of the Reputation Management System (RMS) takes place towards a gradual transfer of reputation management functions from managers to enterprise stakeholders, that is, the traditional reputation activity of the company's management and personnel is being replaced by stakeholder engagement. It is also proved that the level of development of the reputation management organizational system (organizational preconditions) should be high, but aimed not so much at ensuring the activity of the enterprise management and personnel to maintain its reputation, but rather at the involving stakeholders' delegated to manage the company reputation. It was found that the prioritizing stakeholder engagement over traditional reputation management activities at the Ukrainian food processing companies is in its infancy. The target state of the reputation management system, where stakeholder engagement is a priority over management activities, was found only in two enterprises out of 18 studied; in 11 of them, these two parameters are balanced, and in remaining five, traditional activity outwalks engagement. The results of the study of the organizational prerequisites for reputation management among enterprises preferring stakeholder engagement show that they have the following seven elements: 1) internal experts in filling and supporting the corporate website and the enterprise pages and brands on social networks; 2) corporate media editorial/text writers among enterprise staff members; 3) a specialized PR unit (reputation management department); 4) the reputation management business process is regulated; 5) the functional responsibilities of the reputation management participants are integrated with the job descriptions of the relevant employees; 6) a documented formalized PR strategy and operational plans for PR work in various time horizons; 7) a documented formalized plan of anti-crisis PR activities. The above elements make it possible to provide recommendations on the reputation management planning for enterprises seeking to take stakeholder engagement advantages in reputation management. © 2007 - 2018 Frontiers Media S.A.

Weaver C.K.,On Marx: Capitalism and public relations,2018,"Karl Marx’s theory of capitalism inspired the development of critical social inquiry in a multitude of social science disciplines (Carroll, 2004). In the communication field his political economy analysis has underpinned extensive theorising of the media, communication and culture industries, their products and use, ownership and social influences (e.g., Fuchs, 2016; Hardt, 1992; Herman & Chomsky, 2008; Jhally, 1990; Wasko, Murdock, & Sousa, 2011; Wilkie, 2011). Yet, how Marx’s work can be used to theorise public relations, its practices and processes, remains surprisingly under-explored. This may be because public relations has been popularly regarded by many media and communication scholars as a tangential, less interesting, less legitimate and less worthy part of the media infrastructure. Yet, public relations’ role in shaping social, political and economic culture cannot be ignored; while traditional media outlets and organisations are struggling to survive in 21st century digital contexts, public relations is now described as “the most powerful engine in the great media communications complex” (Kaminer & Bonazzo, 2015). © 2018 Taylor & Francis.",
"Tyschenko V., Kolodiziev O., Ostapenko V., Kolodizieva T.",Assessment of the development level of information and communication infrastructure in the regions of Ukraine,2018,"The influence of information is the main productive force and the subject of production for the economic systems development. Information services contribute to the competitive economy, to the provision of optimal conditions for human development, and the implementation of effective democratic procedures. The results of the socioeconomic development of Ukraine testify to the growing lag of the parameters of its competitiveness from many countries of the world and to the strengthening of differentiation in the regional development. Since the regional environment today largely determines the competitiveness of the entire national economy, it becomes important to discuss the appropriate methodological tools for assessing the development level of information and communication infrastructure (ICI) in the regions of Ukraine. Given the necessity of solving a specific problem, a methodological approach to assessing the development level of ICI is proposed, which is based on the calculations of integral indicators by the entropy method and aimed at the implementation of a group of economic regions in accordance with its defined parameters. The improved methodical toolkit takes into account consistent stages of the system for estimating indicators, which allows to analyze and evaluate the levels of ICI regions development and to obtain the value of specific digital divisions between individual regions. The implementation of the proposed scientific and methodological approach allowed to obtain the results of the assessment of the ICI development level, to allocate regional clusters depending on the ICI development levels, to identify factors that restrain the ICI development in the regions and to propose recommendations for their elimination. © The author(s) 2018.",Clusterization; Communication service; Information service; Infrastructure; Integral assessment; Region
"van Deventer M., de Klerk N., Bevan-Dye A.",Influence of perceived ease of use and perceived relative advantage on Generation Y students' attitudes towards and usage behaviour of mobile banking in South Africa,2018,"Mobile banking offers several advantages to both retail banks and their customers. However, in emerging economies such as South Africa, low mobile banking penetration remains a managerial dilemma that requires urgent attention. As a generational cohort, Generation Y is an important current and future customer segment for retail banks and their digital banking channels. The cost implications of servicing individuals in this cohort are largely dependent on their acceptance of these digital channels, including the mobile banking channel. As such, this article reports on a study undertaken to propose and empirically test a technology acceptance model (TAM) that considers the influence of perceived ease of use and perceived relative advantage on Generation Y university students' attitudes towards and usage of mobile banking in South Africa. A self-administered questionnaire was used to survey a non-probability convenience sample of 334 students registered at three public South African university campuses. Descriptive statistics, reliability measures, correlation analysis and structural equation modelling were used to analyse the collected data. The findings infer that South African Generation Y students' perceived ease of use and perceived relative advantage of mobile banking have a significant positive influence on their attitudes towards mobile banking, which, in turn, has a significant positive influence on their mobile banking usage behaviour. Understanding the factors that positively influence the Generation Y cohort's attitudes towards and usage behaviour of mobile banking will help retail banks in their efforts to influence mobile banking consumer behaviour and promote greater acceptance of their mobile channels amongst this important market segment. © The Social Sciences Research Society.",Ease of use; Generation Y university students; Mobile banking attitude; Mobile banking behaviour; Relative advantage; South Africa
"Kitchin R., Coletta C., Evans L., Heaphy L.",Creating smart cities,2018,"Many cities around the world are presently pursuing a smart cities agenda in which networked ICTs are positioned and utilized to try to solve urban issues, drive local and regional economies, and foster civic initiatives. Regardless of whether cities have formulated and are implementing smart city visions, missions and policies, all cities of scale utilize a number of smart city technologies (e.g., intelligent transport systems, urban control rooms, smart grids, sensor networks, building management systems, urban informatics) to manage city services and infrastructures and to govern urban life (see Table 1.1). In this sense, we are already living in the smart city age, with assemblages of networked technologies being used to mediate many aspects of everyday life (e.g., work, consumption, communication, travel, service provision, domestic living), with the trend moving towards ever more computation being embedded into the urban fabric, previously dumb objects and processes becoming ‘smart’ in some fashion, and services being shaped by or delivered in conjunction with digital platforms (Kitchin and Dodge 2011). Smart city agendas corral the development and use of these technologies into a rhetoric and agenda in which digital technologies are championed as commonsensical, pragmatic solutions to all the ills of city life.

An American startup that promised to deliver entrepreneurship for the masses through its technology, Uber instead built a new template for employment using algorithms and Internet platforms. Upending our understanding of work in the digital age, Uberland paints a future where any of us might be managed by a faceless boss. The neutral language of technology masks the powerful influence algorithms have across the New Economy. Uberland chronicles the stories of drivers in more than twenty-five cities in the United States and Canada over four years, shedding light on their working conditions and providing a window into how they feel behind the wheel. The book also explores Uber’s outsized influence around the world: the billion-dollar company is now influencing everything from debates about sexual harassment and transportation regulations to racial equality campaigns and labor rights initiatives. Based on award-winning technology ethnographer Alex Rosenblat’s firsthand experience of riding over 5,000 miles with Uber drivers, daily visits to online forums, and face-to-face discussions with senior Uber employees, Uberland goes beyond the headlines to reveal the complicated politics of popular technologies that are manipulating both workers and consumers. © 2018 by Alex Rosenblat.",

New financial technologies have already attracted many investors and form millions of budgets. Changing the traditional financial services concept, FinTech companies formed a new niche within the financial services market, the dynamic development of which determines the relevance of the development and implementation of an effective regulatory and oversight system. The purpose of the article is to develop an economic and mathematical model for forecasting the development of the FinTech market on the example of Ukraine. In order to study the development of the FinTech industry, a multiple regression model was presented. The model describes the dependence of the total investment value of FinTech from venture investments in financial technology, venture investments in other technologies and venture investments in online lending. Based on this model, the effect of attracting investments with new FinTech projects on the total volume of investments in the industry was clarified. According to the model, with a change in investments in FinTech by 1%, the total rate of venture investments decreases by 0.03, funds in new projects of other companies grow by 0.05, and venture investments in online lending increase by 0.89. According to the analysis of regulatory legislation in the foreign countries of the FinTech services sphere, it was found that the regulation of most of the risks associated with the development of FinTech services falls within the competence of different supervisory authorities, requiring cross-sectoral cooperation between public institutions. © Limited Liability Company",Digital finance; Financial services market; Financial supervision; Financial technologies; FinTech; InsurTech; Investment
"Turulja L., Bajgoric N.","Information technology, knowledge management and human resource management: Investigating mutual interactions towards better organizational performance",2018,"Purpose: Drawing on dynamic capability view, this study aims to offer a conceptual framework to clarify the nature of the effects of firm’s information technology (IT) capability, knowledge management (KM) capability and human resource management (HRM) capability on organizational business performance. IT is the driver that changes all aspects of doing business in the digital era, while both knowledge and human resources (HR) are being increasingly regarded as key levers of competitive advantage in today’s global, dynamic and complex business environment. Design/methodology/approach: The survey methodology was used to collect data. To clarify the relationships between IT capability, KM capability and organizational business performance, the qualitative literature review has been conducted. This review has revealed the three structural models presenting possible interactions between observed constructs. Confirmatory factor analysis has been used for the evaluation of proposed measurement models while structural equation modeling has been used for structural models’ assessments and hypotheses testing. Findings: IT capability enhances HRM capability which enhances KM capability. As a result, KM capability together with IT capability enhances organizational business performance. In addition, there is an interaction effect of KM capability and HRM capability on business performance. Research limitations/implications: First, the sample is based on the emerging economy firms. Second, the use of a self-rating performance measure may be a limitation of the study. Third, the data are not completely normally distributed. Fourth, specificities of different industries were not the subject of analysis in this paper. This should be considered in the interpretation and understanding of the results. Practical implications: From managerial point of view, the paper indicates what managers can do to master their dynamic capabilities, especially those relevant to the business in the digital era. Firms are urged to develop and improve their capabilities to face dynamic environment and intense competition, as well as business globalization. However, to improve certain capability, firms should develop others as well because of their interconnectedness. Originality/value: The main academic contribution of this study is reflected through the development of the integrative model which is aimed at identifying the interrelationships among IT, KM, HRM and business performance. The results indicate the importance of observing interconnections between the firms’ various capabilities to verify the premise of the dynamic capability view. This paper identified relationships between most prominent firm’s resources for the digital era: knowledge, HR and IT.

Textile industry is capable of making yarn to garment products. In Pakistan, the fabric manufacturing sector mainly divided into two main categories: one is weaving and the second is knitting goods. During September 2016 the 9 selected commodities of textile manufactures contributed 59.55% of total exports in which the shares of knitwear, bed-wear, cotton fabrics, articles of apparel & clothing accessories (excl. knitwear), cotton yarn, and towels were 11.95%, 11.27%, 10.96%, 10.56% and 5.71% respectively. These values indicate that knitwear industry in flourishing day by day and putting its major role in export performance. Major type of knitted goods accounted as t-shirts, socks, and other apparel goods. For such industry which accounted important role in economy of economy needs more improvement and attention in terms of product development and also needed to be produced more fashion and design goods. Weft knitting technique is dominant in Pakistani textile industry over warp knitting technique, various small to large companies are operating in this sector. But mostly focused on export orders, very few companies are developing their own product and attracting European, American and other customers in the world. In the technique of weft knitting by using hand flatbed machine which is easy to operate and has ability to develop fabrics from 2 to 14 gauge fabrics with also many easy possibilities in product development. Various small to medium size factories of Pakistan can produce such products by consuming less cost in terms of technology investment. One of technique that can be used is tubular knit fabric on hand flatbed machine. Through developing tubular knit fabrics and by adding or stuffing digital print deigns in it can give aesthetically good product which is cost effective as well. This paper will explain various possibilities of tubular knit fabric in design development which will be suitable for coarser to finer fabric of various end uses such as tops, lowers, knitted jackets, etc. By producing such value added products, Pakistani Textile Industry, specifically areas relevant to knitted goods can increase overall competitiveness in terms of design developments. © 2018 Pakistan Textile Journal.

Nevertheless, there is still scant evidence on electronic marketing orientation (EMO) within the Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SMEs) context. This paper aims to shed light on the key factors that affect the degree of e-marketing adoption among SMEs from an organizational orientation perspective. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a cross-sectional survey of just over 135 European SMEs. The constructs are measured using multi-item indicators to capture the underlying theoretical domains. Findings: The results show that EMO in SMEs is a high order construct that consists of three main components, principally: management beliefs, initiation and implementation activities. The degree of EMO is primarily affected by perceived relative advantage and customer pressure. Research limitations/implications: The study focuses on for-profit SMEs in developed economies. Future researchers may replicate this study using qualitative methods in different contexts (i.e. developing countries) across several technologies and platforms (i.e. websites, internet of things, mobile applications and social media networks). Originality/value: This study further extends the literature on EMO and provides answers to the questions related to the variation in SMEs’ e-marketing adoption.

Coetzee J.,Strategic implications of fintech on South African retail banks,2018,"Background: Since the global financial crisis, banks have been exposed to new opportunities and threats unprecedented in history driven fundamentally by technology. So-called ‘Fintech disruptors’ are aggressively tapping into their service delivery chain to offer clients a better (cheaper, more convenient or efficient) value proposition. As banks have subsequently been forced to think more strategically about how to conduct themselves due to the imminent use of, for example, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, biometrics and big data, regulators have simultaneously had to ensure that the pervasiveness of technological disruption does not threaten the soundness of banks and the stability of economies. Aim: To identify the strategic implications of Fintech on South African retail banks. Setting: The study is conducted in the South African retail banking industry. Methods: A post-positivist paradigm approach that is qualitative in nature. Results: There are several main findings: firstly, technology-based skills are becoming mandatory for staff and regulators alike; secondly, interaction policy is migrating clients towards a remote-based distribution strategy; thirdly, the bank of the future will not rely as heavily on brick-and-mortar branches as it has in the past; fourthly, new competitors are entering the fray and offer competitive digital-only solutions; finally, given the innovation and growth shown by these disruptors, financial sector regulators will have to find ways to hold them accountable. Conclusion: By adapting to the Fintech revolution, South African retail banks are hoping to become strategically pre-emptive rather than merely proactive. This will allow them not only to identify opportunities first, but also to offer solutions before competitors are able to do either of these. © 2018. The Authors.",

World Economic Forum, The Global Competitiveness Report, 2016–2017, Geneva, 2016, ISBN-13: 978-1-944835-04-0.) of competitiveness (2015–2016), taking into account recent economic developments in Iran (up until 2017) especially as a result of the lifting up of the sanctions against Iran, including legal reforms to facilitate foreign investment, creating businesses, a digital platform and an organization for import and export procedures, structural changes to improve and development of private sector, and great amendments to taxation legislation for foreign investment. In this paper we will illuminate some basic facts and features of the Iran’s economy and opportunities which have been ignored by some reports. We will discover that foreign investors in Iran enjoy the same supports and privileges that are offered to the Iranian investors. In this connection, the Direct Taxation Law rules that no discrimination must be applied in terms of taxation as regards foreign and domestic investors. In this regard, similar to Iranian investors foreign investors pay the equal amount of taxes. In the same way, tax exemptions and discounts have, further, been established equally for both foreign and domestic investors. Also we ascertain that there are four basic freedoms including assets and many other privileges and methods to invest in Iran especially in social media. By means of giving some examples of recent developments we show that the situation is very perfect, especially in terms of market size, to invest in social media in Iran. However, it should be kept in mind that, similar to many countries, a variety of legal arrangements govern different business activities in Iran, some of them are specifically related to media and some of the are general, and indirectly are concerned with this area of activity. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.",Competitiveness; Investment; Iran; Laws; Legal challenges; Media market; Restrictions
"Kumar R., Sachan A., Mukherjee A.",Direct vs indirect e-government adoption: an exploratory study,2018,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the factors that influence direct and indirect adoption of e-government services in India. Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual model has been proposed by integrating the factors influencing adoption of e-government services from extant literature. A quantitative technique is used for the purpose of the study. Findings: The study classifies e-government adoption in two types: direct adoption and indirect adoption. The study has found that there is some difference between the factors influencing direct and indirect e-government adoption. Perceived awareness, perceived usefulness, trust in internet, trust in government and social influence are found to be positively correlated to direct and indirect e-government adoption. Availability of resources, computer self-efficacy, perceived ease-of-use, perceived compatibility, multilingual option and voluntariness are positively correlated to direct e-government adoption and negatively correlated to indirect e-government adoption. Perceived image is found to be significant for direct e-government adoption but non-significant for indirect adoption. Trust in intermediary is found to be significant only for indirect e-government adoption. Research limitations/implications: The sample size of 382 may not be a proper representation of a country like India, which has huge diversity and is densely populated. The study has been conducted in India, which is a developing country. The result might not be significant for developed countries. Practical implications: The findings of this study provide useful insights into the decision-making process of e-government users in India and similar emerging economies. These findings can be important for government officials tasked with providing e-governance services. Originality/value: Despite the digital divide, how the government is expecting its citizens to access e-government services and derive benefits and how the needy will be able to cope with the mandatory e-government services is an interesting topic to study. This leads to a new concept of indirect adoption. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Adoption; Direct adoption; E-government; India; Indirect adoption; Intermediary
"Pokrovskaia N., Khansuvarova T., Khansuvarov R.",Network decentralized regulation with the fog-edge computing and blockchain for business development,2018,"The changings in the world economic system are characterized by the growing decentralization of regulative mechanisms. The technical decentralization of streaming big data treatment is fulfilled with the fog and edge computing, the social regulation is transformed with the transactions through blockchain and sharing economy. The cryptocurrencies and smart contracts are the examples of the distributed regulation among participants, built on the basis of blockchain technologies and within the space of individuals' deals. The public regulation is transforming from the State apparatus toward technical equipment and software including decentralized systems in the contrast to the previously developed heavy sluggish systems, which are constantly showing institutional traps and errors, causing the data loss and having a low level of usability. In this paper, we interpret the networking as the process of the inclusion of every concerned actor into local or global group with close communicative ties taking part in a socioeconomic activity. The networks are perceived as, both, social communities and technical communications. In Russia, Masterchain project is an example of the attempt to introduce the technical instrument of the confident relationship in the banking sector and private property deals, especially, in real-estate sector, which met the social and institutional resistance. The research purpose is to find the essential features of the networking as a process of fostering the new social organization, on the basis of individual choices instead of a centralized officially approved system, through the digital democracy and smart economic environment including the new level of the security attained, cybersecurity and personal safety, as the outcome. The conceptual research reflects the analysis of the evolution of regulative mechanisms of society organization due to the implementation of technical regulative approaches, devices and software. The study of the spread of fog computing and blockchain use is carried out with the survey of students and of enterprises' managers. The analysis of the obstacles that interfere into the process of the fog computing and blockchain implementation is based on the examining the Masterchain project and its late and difficult introduction since 2016, and the revealed ignorance of the fog computing use. The research outcome is the understanding of new ethical and economic regulative mechanisms to be built. © The Authors, 2018.

This is necessary because today there is a rapid growth of technological capabilities and of rate indicators of implementation of various information services and applications, required by community. One of the main issues of the safe use of these services is to ensure information security, which requires the use of effective high­rate information protection systems and high­performance generation of random data sequences. In the course of conducting research with the aim of enhancing productivity, the features of conversion of actual noise processes, taking into consideration their non­stationarity and deviations from the probability distribution were analyzed. We proposed the ways to improve the methods of analog­to­digital conversion with the optimization of the scale dynamic range quantization and the pitch of discretization of a noise process over time. With a view to aligning statistical characteristics, the possibility of using the processing methods that enhance its statistical quality with economy of high­rate losses was explored. These are the method of sampling equally probable combinations (von Neumann - Elias -Ryabko - Matchikina) and the method of code processing (Santha - Vazirani) that provide an increased effectiveness due to code extension and involve conversion of the sequence: in the first method, with the use of equally probable combinations with rejection of unnecessary data; in the second method, without their rejection with the possibility of linear conversion. In order to optimize the conversion parameters at both stages of generation and to adapt these parameters to the peculiarities and changeability of characteristics of converted random processes, it was proposed to use feedbacks of converters' outputs with previous conversion elements. The adjustment of the specified parameters can be made during the generation based on the results of statistical analysis of the outputs of conversion stages. The obtained results are quite important, since their implementation in modern information protection systems will enable guaranteeing information security and safe usage of applications of the modern information service and the introduction of new applications. © V.

"Zalan T., Toufaily E.",The promise of fintech in emerging markets: Not as disruptive,2017,"Fintech innovations-innovations by financial services providers based on digital technology-are widely believed to have a disruptive effect on the financial services industry. The purpose of the paper is to investigate how financial services industry participants perceive the effect of digital disruption as well as to explore what strategies are being adopted by incumbents in the face of potential disruption from fintech challengers. Based on an exploratory study with stakeholders from the financial ecosystem in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), the findings show that the fintech sector is still nascent, but is likely to be disruptive in selected product and customer segments. Multiple regulatory, structural, and cultural obstacles stand in the way of fintech adoption. Incumbents’ preferred strategy to face the future disruption is the bank-fintech collaboration, which will create new value for ecosystem partners and speed up innovation. Our study adds useful insights to the body of knowledge related to disruptive innovations in general and fintech in emerging markets in particular. Specifically, the collaborative response is inconsistent with the strategies usually recommended for incumbents in disruptive innovation theory. We hypothesize that our participants’ preference for partnering can be explained in the light of the distinctive characteristics of the digital economy. We propose a framework for creating a financial services platform embedded in a broader ecosystem to facilitate the bank-fintech collaboration. © 2017, University of Finance and Management in Warsaw.

The availability of digital technologies has significantly increased in the last decade, shifting the focus of policy-makers from on the diffusion of these technologies to their usage by governments, companies and also individuals. Actually, digital technologies and internet became the main forces for transforming the modern world and its economy. Activating within a turbulent environment, Romania faced many challenges in the last three years, but it managed to perform better from period to period. Relative to the past performance, Romania registers a higher rate of digitalization, benefiting from coverage of rapid broadband connections, mostly in urban areas. This made Romania having the second highest share of subscriptions within the EU in 2016. Romania has developed increasingly fast over the last years and reached a position closer to the EU average, which translates into a positive evolution. While positive, the obtained results are not enough to compensate the country's digital skills deficit.",DESI index; Digital Competitiveness; Digital Economy; Romania

There are four factors that allow the integration and sharing of values through online and offline interactions: organizational culture, digital technology, implementation of creative methodologies and digital transformation. In this respect, the interactions specific to systems based on open governance were analyzed. Interactions between online and offline are also very important in the educational process. For this reason, we introduced a new concept, called TOTO (»Teaching Online, Transfer Offline» »Transfer Offline, Teaching Online»). This slogan is meant to promote the acquisition and transfer of knowledge in the future. Particular importance was given to studying the effects of the interactions between Personal Online Learning Networks and Offline Learning Teams. Since social media is a common tool for most socio-economic activities, it has been considered necessary to carry out a case study on the interactions specific to this environment.",creativity; education; engineering; knowledge

Le Roux G.,"TTIP negotiations, policy convergence, and the transatlantic digital economy",2017,"The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) has the potential to be a landmark treaty on many grounds. According to European and American officials, one of the main features that should differentiate the TTIP from other bilateral free trade agreements is, beyond its unprecedented scale, the ambition of its regulatory dimension. On both sides of the Atlantic there is a strong incentive to mitigate the impacts of behind-The-border obstacles that mostly stem from existing divergences between laws and regulations applied in Europe and in the United States. To do this, trade negotiators, together with policymakers and regulators, attempt, when possible and desirable, to facilitate the convergence of the policies that frame the European and the American markets. This paper analyzes how convergence may be reached with regards to the regulation of the digital economy, a relatively new area of interest in the field of trade law and policy studies, that seems to deserve a specific attention considering the growing importance it has taken at the domestic level and in the context of trade negotiations. © V.K.

Lundqvist B.,Standardization for the digital economy: The issue of interoperability and access under competition law,2017,"This article discusses several aspects of the Digital Economy. First, the data industry and the business conduct of the approaching Internet of Things are presented. Second, the current standardization efforts promoted by the European Commission are discussed, for example, what the challenges are, how much should be standardized, and how prestandard consortia should be judged. Third, current and future competition law issues for the Digital Economy, in reference to standardization, are identified. The article states joint technology consortia for upper-layer standards, i.e. in the ecosystems, should benefit from heightened scrunity under Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), while system leaders’ business conduct in the Digital Economy may be judged in reference to Article 102 TFEU. The article concludes that the main issue under general competition law in the Data Economy, at its current stage of development, is to create a level playing field by trying to facilitate the implementation of the Internet of Things. Thus, competition authorities should be cautious about the current ecosystem consortia driven standard-setting movement in the Digital Economy, while also facilitating the application of Article 102 TFEU when system leaders possibly abuse their dominance by not giving access to their respective ecosystems. © The Author(s) 2017.",Antitrust; Big data; Competition law; Data protection; Ecosystem; Industrial internet; Intellectual property law; Internet of Things; Open data; Platforms; Privacy; Psi; SEP; Standardization

We introduce peer-to-peer file sharing as a distinct distribution channel enabled by the Internet that provides access to all media products at a low cost. We report two main findings. First, the Internet renders legacy cultural policy inefficient, and the elimination of import barriers and the reduction of subsidized production can be desirable even when governments exhibit paternalistic preferences favoring the consumption of domestic content. And second, even though the Internet increases cultural diversity within countries, it can also reduce diversity across them. © 2017",Cultural diversity; Cultural policy; Digital distribution; Media industry

Huber A.S.,The digital enterprise takes shape,2017,"When I wrote my chapter in the first book about Industrie 4.0 about three years ago, the entire situation in this area was characterized by vagueness as to the definition of Industrie 4.0. You could feel a great sense of anxiety and the impression that we were talking about something very significant, perhaps affecting the very existence of some companies, of branches of industry, and even entire national economies, such as in Germany, with a value creation structure characterized by small and midsize enterprises and oriented toward production. In the meanwhile, the fog has lifted a bit, and we think we can make out some sharper outlines. This chapter will attempt to further clarify these outlines here and there, as well as share some impressions I have collected in the area of digitalization in global business. At the 2016 Hanover Trade Fair, it was easy to get the impression that the general anxiety on this topic had diminished considerably. Yet, there were hardly any signs that great progress had been made in defining content. There was, however, to some extent, a conspicuously flexible use of the term 'Industrie 4.0,' overheard when some suppliers described their automation products and systems. If one wanted to make an interim summary about Industrie 4.0 at this point, one would have to admit that, even though not much useful content has been defined, awareness of the quickly progressing digitalization in industry and the resulting expected changes and necessary reactive measures have increased substantially. That fact alone may justify the efforts previously taken. For pragmatic reasons, because a sufficient definition for Industrie 4.0 had been lacking, in my first chapter of the first book on Industrie 4.0, I concentrated on our own digitalization strategy, which we at Siemens summarize using the term 'digital enterprise,' and established its proximity to Industrie 4.0. However, our digitalization strategy began as early as in 2001, with the acquisition of Orsi, a small Italian enterprise which at the time had been focused on the development of MES systems, among other things. digitalization accelerated significantly starting in 2007 with the acquisition of UGS. In this chapter, I will report on the progress we have made in the meantime in the implementation of our digitalization strategy. I will let readers decide what falls under the category of Industrie 4.0 and what does not. I will also relate the observations and developments regarding significant production procedures that particularly rely on digitalization and data consistency. © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany 2018.

Rückert T.,The IoT paves the way for a networked economy,2017,"In the past two decades, the internet has connected billions of people, significantly more than half of humanity, with one another, placing their communication on a completely new foundation. Now, ""things"" are being added. They are being equipped with capabilities allowing them to hear, see, feel and ""think,"" which is described in words as ""intelligent"" and ""smart."" And they are being networked. According to the estimates of Gartner and McKinsey, by the year 2020, 20 to 25 million devices will be online via their own internet addresses. And, following communication between people, this will also fundamentally change value creation. Manufacturers can equip their products with sensors, actuators, miniature cameras and other digital components at ever decreasing costs. Software embedded in the products then allows data to be generated, collected and analyzed while those devices are in use. The Internet of Things will make sure that not only an individual product becomes a data supplier in this way, but that products will be able to communicate with each other and with people using their data in a virtually limitless manner. © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany 2018.

Lechman E.,Technological substitution in Asia,2017,"Over last few decades, the world has witnessed, the process of rapid diffusion of new information and communication technologies (ICT) that enforced remarkable changes and structural shifts going far beyond economic sphere of life. ICT become fast available widespread and rapidly growing access to and use of ICT, additionally enhances the process of technological substitution, which consists in switching from the 'old' to 'new' technological solutions. The on-going digital revolution, undeniably, pervasively impacts and reshapes societies and economies, hence deserves special attention and interest. This book provides extensive evidence on information and communication technologies development diffusion patterns, unveils specific 'network effects' that enhance rapid spread of ICT, and detect major macroeconomic determinants of this process, across 36 Asian economies over the period 1980-2015. Moreover, this research traces country-specific patterns of the unique process. We consider two types of technological substitution, namely: 'fixed-to-mobile' type technological substitution process encompasses switching from fixed telephony ('old technology') to mobile telephony ('new technology'); while the 'fixed-to-wireless' type technological substitution - switching from fixed (narrowband and/or broadband) fixed Internet networks ('old technologies') to wireless (mainly broadband) Internet networks ('new technologies'). Moreover, this study empirically identifies the potential effect of selected macroeconomic factors, which may potentially enhance dynamic spread of ICT. © 2018 Ewa Lechman. All rights reserved.",
Yeh C.-C.,Using a hybrid model to evaluate development strategies for digital content,2017,"Digital content (DC) is one of the most important areas of growth within the global creative and knowledge-based economy. The paper aims to propose a systematic approach to evaluating strategies to develop DC industry and how it should be effectively implemented. Our analysis employs a hybrid multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) approach by using the interpretive structural modelling (ISM) method to deal with the interrelationship among criteria, and the analytic network process (ANP) method is employed to determine the relative weights of each criterion. Finally, in order to choose the alternative for the ideal solution of this problem, a technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) is used. To demonstrate the validity of this method, the Taiwan's DC industry is used as an illustrative case. The study generates results that can serve as a reference for decision-makers in the formulation of their development strategies for DC. Moreover, the evaluation model constructed in this study goes beyond existing measures and may serve as a reference for a decision-maker. © 2017 Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press.",analytic net-work process; development strategies; digital content; interpretive structural modelling; multiple criteria decision making; Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution
"Watanabe C., Naveed K., Neittaanmäki P.",ICT-driven disruptive innovation nurtures un-captured GDP – Harnessing women's potential as untapped resources,2017,"The harnessing of untapped resources has become essential for inclusive growth in digital economies particularly as developed economies continue to age demographically. The harnessing of women's potential is an urgent subject in this context, and successive initiatives have been flourishing in many countries. However, given the institutional complexity of the issue, as well as considerable variety across nations, uniformed non-systematic approaches are hardly satisfactory in achieving a timely solution. Against this back drop, this paper analyzed a new information communication technology (ICT)-driven disruptive innovation that may nurture un-captured GDP by harnessing untapped resources such as women's economic potential. Using a unique dataset representing the state of gender balance improvement, an empirical numerical analysis of 44 countries was attempted. These countries were classified as emerging, industrialized, and with a specific culture based particularly on the traditions of a male-dominated society. It was found that while industrialized countries, typically Finland, have achieved high performance in co-evolution between “econo-cultural development,” ICT advancement, and gender balance improvement, emerging countries have been constrained by low ICT advancement. In addition, notwithstanding their high economic level, countries with a specific culture have been constrained by a traditional male-dominated culture, Japan being a typical case. Based on these findings, lessons from industrialized countries for both emerging countries and countries with a specific culture were analyzed. It was suggested that ICT should be strategically advanced depending on the state of what we are calling “econo-cultural development” for constructing co-evolution of gender balance improvement along with techno-economic development. A new practical approach for harnessing untapped resources for sustainable growth was thus explored. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Cultural dimensions; Gender balance; Trilateral co-evolution; Untapped resources; Women board members
"Latha K.F.M., Uthayakumar R.",A two-echelon supply chain coordination with quantity discount incentive for fixed lifetime product in a fuzzy environment,2017,"Efficient and effective management of a supply chain is of great importance for the success of the digital economy. Coordination among the members of a supply chain play a vital role for its effective management. The members of the supply chain may agree to cooperate initially, but owing to the competition prevailing in business environments, they may be tempted to maximize their profits and deviate from any agreement. So, effective mechanism is essential to enforce coordination among the members in a supply chain. In today’s competitive environment, the inventory managers are also interested in simple and easy procedures to apply them in their organizations. This paper investigates a single-manufacturer and a single-buyer two echelon supply chain model for a fixed lifetime product in a fuzzy cost environment with a quantity discount strategy as a coordination mechanism. Crisp models are developed under different scenarios (1) without coordination (2) with coordination and (3) system optimization. Fuzzy models are also formulated by representing the ordering cost and the holding cost of the manufacturer by trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. Signed distance method is adopted for defuzzification. Numerical results highlighting the sensitivity of various parameters are also elucidated. © 2017, The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden.",Fixed lifetime product; Fuzzy numbers; Inventory; Quantity discount; Signed distance method; Supply chain coordination

"Hamalainen M., Karjalainen J.",Social manufacturing: When the maker movement meets interfirm production networks,2017,"New business models harnessing the power of individuals have already revolutionized service industries and digital content production. In this study, we investigate whether a similar phenomenon is taking place in manufacturing industries. We start by conceptually defining two distinct forms of firm-individual collaboration in manufacturing industries: (1) social cloud manufacturing, in which firms outsource manufacturing to individuals, and (2) social platform manufacturing, in which firms provide manufacturing services to individuals. We then empirically investigate the nature of firm-individual collaboration within these forms, focusing on the role of individuals. We find that the individuals are often makers who view their participation primarily as a hobby and are driven mainly by nonmonetary benefits, that the design process often involves both parties, and that the two forms of collaboration exploit different enabling technologies. Our findings suggest that firms working with individuals can potentially reap multiple benefits, including fresh ideas, broader design support, and quick delivery times. This article contributes to an improved understanding of how firms can build potentially disruptive business models in manufacturing industries by leveraging individuals, thereby adding to the emerging stream of literature on social manufacturing. © 2017 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University",3-D printing; Cloud manufacturing; Maker movement; Sharing economy; Social manufacturing
Larios-Hernández G.J.,Blockchain entrepreneurship opportunity in the practices of the unbanked,2017,"Two billion people in developing economies have limited or no access to formal financial services, creating cause for substantial research interest in financial inclusion as a complex multidimensional phenomenon. Digital finance technologies, including blockchain, have empowered a type of crescive entrepreneurship that seeks opportunities in relation to financially excluded individuals. This article hypothesizes that nonmonetary causal factors and informal financial practices play a major role in habits of the financially excluded, which would favor blockchain's disintermediation features over the incumbent approach. After applying fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) to determine the conditions related to financial practice and motivations that explain the absence of a formal bank account, I prescribe five sensitivities that blockchain entrepreneurs need to consider when targeting this segment. The value of this article's approach extends well beyond traditional unisystemic views for financial inclusion, as blockchain-based entrepreneurial opportunities emerge to reveal alternative forms of disintermediated financial services, which we exemplify in startups modeling informal practices. Blockchain entrepreneurship can generate semi-formal financial services that bring financial aspirations closer to people. My perspective is relevant to blockchain entrepreneurs who aim to understand the practices of the unbanked as source information for the development of innovative solutions. © 2017 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University",Blockchain; Financial entrepreneurship; Financial inclusion; Fintech; fsQCA; Informal finance
"Gupta S., Gupta S.",Modeling economic system using fuzzy cognitive maps,2017,"Macro-economic planning and policy decisions on various economic parameters do drive national economic activities leading to economic and social growth. These undergo dynamic changes on account of their mutual inter-relations and interactions and also due to factors internal and external to the economy. The objective of this work is to attempt and model major chosen economic variables using fuzzy cognitive map to decipher the development paradigm of the national economic system with respect to their mutual influences. Using the data of the Indian state, the study concluded that policy makers in developing nations must take steps to increase government spending, strengthen the local currency, reduce liabilities, increase fiscal deficit (within acceptable limits) and boost tax revenue in decreasing order of priority for early achievement of the desired objectives of higher GDP growth rate and social development. Moreover, the developed model inferred the possibility of GDP growth rate being influenced by under-reporting of services output in earlier years as compared to the later part of the study period.

"Pilik M., Juřičkova E., Kwarteng M.A.",On-line shopping behaviour in the Czech Republic under the digital transformation of economy,2017,"The paper presents selected aspects of shopping behaviour with a focus on the main reasons for on-line shopping. Basing on the results of extensive research, we determined that the main reasons for on-line shopping are the cost, followed by comfort and convenience, while shopping on-line. It holds true for all age groups observed. Age increase pushes shoppers to pay more attention to convenience of shopping, and therefore it can be considered an essential factor for making an on-line purchase. Further statistical analysis confirmed the fact that the Czech Republic has caught up with rest of Europe and the world in the area of Internet use and on-line shopping, and the commercial power of the Internet will continue to grow. The paper focuses on consumer behaviour within digital economy on e-commerce markets in the Czech Republic, and examines customers’ purchases and their motives for on-line shopping. The survey was divided into two parts. Qualitative part of the research was based on structured interviews in 2015-2016 with companies in the Czech Republic. These interviews were important for the definition of the research questions and further quantitative research, focused on customers of the e-shops and Internet users. Quantitative research consisted of 41 questions, and was conducted among the e-shoppers who filled out the questionnaire. 2,432 respondents participated in the research, and 1,601 of them completed all the questions in the questionnaire. The results we obtained show that the price of merchandise is the main reason for the shopping on the Internet in the Czech Republic. This fact rejected hypothesis about a dominant role of convenience for shopping and expected preferences of the customers. Convenience and price have impact on the behaviour of those Czech customers, who prefer brick-and-mortar stores, and still shop on-line irregularly. © Institute of Society Transformation, 2017.",Customer; Digital Transformation; E-Commerce; E-Shop; On-line Shopping Behaviour

Enterprises should find new ways to attract and retain the attention of users. The purpose of the article is to develop recommendations for managing consumer behaviour in the economy of impressions, or the experience economy based on personalisation. The following research methods are used: analysis and synthesis, logical generalisation, abstract logic and the hypothetic-deductive method. The article formulates a hypothesis based on the phenomenon of the dependence of a person’s emotional response on the phase of his/her biological rhythm already in use in the practice of communication management and psychology. To partially confirm the hypothesis, a pilot experiment was prepared and conducted on the basis of the social network Facebook in 2017. The respondents were presented with an advertising multimedia product with a subsequent assessment of the emotional state. The received statistical results confirm the accepted hypothesis. Based on the hypothetic-deductive method, recommendations for managing consumer behaviour in the economy of impressions have been developed. The essence of recommendations is reduced to how to take into account the phases of human biological rhythms, as well as the choice of intellectual and emotional filling of the multimedia advertising product. Taking into account the personalisation processes, the models of users’ perception of advertising are modified. The process of users’ perception of the content, its impressions and emotions lie in interrelation with its biological rhythms. If the developer knows the data about the activity of the emotional and intellectual biorhythms of the user, it becomes possible to control impressions, passing the relevant content in the most favourable periods for perception. Practical application of the proposed recommendations will be useful for companies that carry out advertising activities in social networks that implement contextual advertising and direct marketing. © Institute of Society Transformation, 2017.",Economy of impressions; Emotional; Experience; Experience economy; Impressions; Intellectual content; Management; Personalisation; Theory of human biological cycles
"Burhan M., Singh A.K., Jain S.K.",Patents as proxy for measuring innovations: A case of changing patent filing behavior in Indian public funded research organizations,2017,"The process of innovation is crucial and essential part of economic growth. Public funded research organizations (PFROs) are believed to be an integral part of National Innovation Systems (NIS) and therefore form an important part of research focused on developing and enhancing national innovation capacities. PFROs have witnessed substantial changes in terms of increased patent filing over the years. Patenting rates and patent propensity have long been used as a well-grounded proxy for measuring technological innovations in the literature. Variant patent filing motives of researchers may reflect a fundamental weakness in use of patents for measuring innovations. Transition economies like India, with characteristics which may differ from those of heavily studied advanced western economies, are the focus of this study. Data were collected from 43 PFROs in India during the period 2005–2010. This study examined the patent filing behavior in PFROs by analyzing various motives that drive the patent filing of its researchers. Negative Binomial Regression Models were constructed to explain whether these patent filing motives impact patent portfolios in PFROs. We observed that only few of them strengthen the patent portfolios. The results connote the significance of taking granted patents, rather than filed patents, as a proxy for measure innovations in PFROs. Based on our results we also derive some policy and decision-making implications for public research particularly in the context of transition economies. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Emerging economies; Innovations; Intellectual property rights; National Innovation Capability; National Innovation System; Patent filing behavior; Patents; Public funded research organizations; R&D
Hooton C.A.,"America's online 'jobs': Conceptualizations, measurements, and influencing factors",2017,"The paper examines the size and distribution of online income positions (OIPs) from internet platforms in the United States. While researchers have developed traditional internet sector employment estimates (e.g., engineers), this secondary OIP market remains largely unmeasured due to shortcomings in industrial codes, conceptualizations, and methods. The estimates that do exist vary greatly. The paper addresses these shortcomings through original survey data collected directly from internet sector companies, allowing it to develop the first comprehensive look at the market for online income opportunities. The paper provides national and state-level estimates, finding approximately 23.9 million OIPs exist currently in 2017. The paper finds that these OIPs are present across all 50 states and the District of Columbia and that their distribution is less tied to population levels than traditional employment. The paper also develops a model for OIP levels with a surprisingly strong fit, which demonstrates that OIPs are driven by relative cost to income factors, exposure to the 'tech' sector, and internet access, but not by unemployment. To the extent of the paper's knowledge, this is the only research that has drawn on actual internet firm data to estimate the size of the OIP market. © 2017 National Association for Business Economics.",Digital economy; Internet; Internet sector; Labor markets; Sharing economy

Beltrán F.,Build it and it will disrupt: A national broadband platform to fuel New Zealand's digital economy,2017,"The fibre-to-the-home, high-speed broadband network in New Zealand known as the Ultra-Fast Broadband (UFB) network is already changing the landscape of the telecommunications market in the country. The future New Zealand broadband ecosystem is being shaped by decisions that impact both the structure of the market and the supplyside of the ecosystem. UFB embodies the infrastructure of New Zealand's digital platform. It is not only a high-speed broadband network; it is also conceived as an openaccess platform whereby any service provider can and will provide services. Opting for an open-access, high speed broadband platform New Zealand is effectively instigating major changes in the structure of the market, which in turn are expected to deliver profound changes in the range of services and the way they are delivered to consumers. This chapter presents the New Zealand case as an example of the scope and impact of digital disruption with major changes in infrastructure ownership and market structure and competition encouraged by UFB's open-access architecture and regulation. The main argument is that both the technical characteristics of the broadband network and major policy and regulatory decisions must necessarily shape the potential for digital markets creation, transformation, and growth. © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany 2018.",
Schallbruch M.,The european network and information security directive - A cornerstone of the digital single market,2017,"Digital markets strongly depend on a sufficient level of network and information security. As the digitization of all business processes leads to a complex landscape of digital networks, systems, and services, overarching security standards become crucial for the economic development. Thus, state actors worldwide aim to build regulatory frameworks to somehow guarantee network and information security. Right now, with regard to the digital economy, Europe is not at the forefront of the global economic regions. By passing a new regulation on network and information security, the Union aims to present a modern regulatory approach to a key issue of the digital economy. The EU directive, set into force in August 2016, is a major step to a stable regulatory environment, that might be a raw model for regulators worldwide. However, from a technology perspective, the legislation will predominantly lead to compliance efforts of market operators, not to technological innovations. To some extent, this can be bridged by the development of market standards under the regulation. Nevertheless, further regulatory action is suggested. Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany 2018.",

"Krahn B., Rietz C.",Consumers' digital self-determination: Everything under control?,2017,"The analysis and use of steadily growing sets of data from business processes and consumer interactions and the intelligent linking of data provide tremendous development potential for the digital economy, but also involve risks that are widely discussed in association with data privacy. At the same time, of course, consumers also benefit from innovative and new products and services which are only made possible by intelligent data analysis. But when digital data becomes the raw material for value added on the one hand and appealing products for connected life and work on the other hand it appears that these principles alone do not suffice any longer. Not least because due to technical reasons alone the cross-linking of economy and society generates large amounts of new data that are often not even acknowledged by consumers and the creation of which they cannot prevent. Up until now, there has only been insufficient systematic assessment of the consumers' experience associated with their data sovereignty, digital self-determination respectively. However, the exercise of digital self-determination by the consumers themselves and a corresponding rise of awareness is a key prerequisite for acting confidently in the digital world of the Internet of Things and in digital business processes. The following study provides answers to the following questions related to consumers' digital self-determination: What is a coherent, plausible concept of 'digital self-determination'? How can we measure (dimensions of) 'digital self-determination'? What degree/amount of 'digital self-determination' do customers/users of digital media want? Based on the empirical results the concept of ""digital self-determination"" is described and accentuated. On the one hand, it can thus be a foundation for a consumer-centered adaptation of manufacturing or business processes. On the other hand, it can also provide implications for policy-steering considerations. © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany 2018.",

In slightly more than a decade, the World Wide Web has gone from the idea of an obscure English scientist to a consumer-oriented technology system with an expected one billion users by 2005. The technologies that enable this to happen are advancing rapidly, which is leading to both an unprecedented number of start-up companies and a host of innovative new alliances between companies. The growth has been so rapid and unexpected that little research and analysis has yet been done on what impact this transformation has had or will have on the ability of companies to meet the global sustainability challenge. As environmental strategy has traditionally been portrayed in terms of risk cutting and resource efficiency, there is a danger that critical business issues such as information technology, R&D and e-commerce development are examined in isolation from the wider sustainable business perspective. An important objective of the book is to explore, document and raise awareness of sustainability concerns arising from the emerging global information economy. The information economy is defined in the broadest sense possible, including software, hardware, telecommunication - traditional and wireless - and advanced communication technologies. Some of the key issues and questions that are examined include:Case studies on how and to what degree sustainability concerns are being integrated into the business model of electronic, telecommunication and dot.com firms. The relationship between the diffusion of information and communication technologies and the energy and resource intensity of companies. The role of information and communication technologies in the shaping of policies for sustainability, its impacts on sustainable or unsustainable lifestyles and its implications for the interaction between companies and other actors.

In this article, however, we argue that the digital commons cannot by themselves constitute genuine forms of resistance for they are vulnerable to what we call ‘the illusion of the digital commons’, which leads to a form of ‘false consciousness’ that Sloterdijk designates as deep-rooted cynicism. This cynicism, we argue, ties in with the contemporary discontent with practices in the ‘sharing economy’, in which we pay particular attention to the practice of hospitality exchange on platforms such as BeWelcome, Couchsurfing, and Airbnb. We utilize Georg Simmel’s theory of money to explicate how exchange relations are mediated by technologically enabled explicit and implicit price mechanisms. Accordingly, we argue that the technologically mediated practice of digital commoning can constitute the ‘illusion of the commons’, an apparent form of commoning through digital exchanges that is inherently vulnerable to foster non-emancipatory practices. We argue that this results in a form of cynicism: of commoners that are disillusioned by ‘the power of things’. Only a ‘politics of the digital commons’, a democratic governance that keeps a check on the vulnerability of digital exchanges, and a free relation to technologies can help in avoiding the illusion of the digital commons. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",Alternative economies; capitalism; cynicism; digital commons; false consciousness; post-capitalism
"Park H., Armstrong C.M.J.",Collaborative apparel consumption in the digital sharing economy: An agenda for academic inquiry,2017,"While apparel businesses leveraging the sharing economy have begun to emerge in recent years, academic research on “sharing” consumption for apparel is extremely limited. To fill this research gap, the researchers analyze current literature to present a conceptual framework that offers a durable theoretical foundation about the concept of collaborative consumption for apparel. Using a metatheory approach, the researchers develop a framework that explores how two major Internet-supported collaborative consumption modes (utility-based nonownership and redistributed ownership) manifest in an apparel context. Next, the researchers explore the implications of each consumption mode to understand the consumer's relationship with the product, peers, and businesses involved in these sharing schemes. A series of research propositions are also developed to stimulate discussion and future research about collaborative apparel consumption. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",apparel consumption; collaborative consumption; sharing; sharing economy
Minter K.,Negotiating labour standards in the gig economy: Airtasker and Unions New South Wales,2017,"The 'gig economy' uses digital platforms to bypass many of the regular responsibilities and costs of employment. Ambiguity as to whether gig-economy workers are independent contractors, dependent contractors or employees allows the undermining of traditional labour standards governing minimum wages and other legislated employment conditions. Labour law and institutions need to catch up to the new reality of this form of work and develop new tools to protect and enhance minimum standards for workers in digital platform businesses. Unions, business and government all have a role to play in the long term. Meanwhile, direct engagement between these new firms and workers' advocates can also help to mitigate the risks posed to labour standards by digital business models, by addressing regulatory gaps. This article is a case study of innovative negotiations between one platform business (Airtasker) and Unions New South Wales, a peak trade unions body in New South Wales, Australia, in order to establish agreed minimum standards for engagements negotiated through this platform. © The Author(s) 2017.",'gig' economy; 'sharing economy'; Digital platform work; independent contractors; industrial relations; labour standards
"Richter C., Kraus S., Brem A., Durst S., Giselbrecht C.",Digital entrepreneurship: Innovative business models for the sharing economy,2017,"What's mine is yours. An increasing number of people are participating in sharing and exchanging information, knowledge, data and goods. As research addressing the so-called ‘sharing economy’ is still in its infancy, this article aims to shed light on it. To do this, a qualitative research approach comprising guided interviews with 14 companies from Germany, Austria and Switzerland provides detailed insights into different aspects of the sharing economy phenomenon. Our results make a direct contribution to sharing economy research, especially regarding the new business models of start-ups. Here, we find a clear difference between the relevance of economic and social orientation. The latter appears to be in higher demand among customers than entrepreneurs. The increasingly digitalized environment has led to a changed living situation characterized by urbanity, openness to new solutions, changed working situations and new mindsets. All of these aspects drive the sharing economy. The results of this paper are summarized in a framework highlighting the requirements, drivers and goals of the sharing economy. Considering the limited research in this field, the developed framework is a strong basis for discussion, critique and/or support of future research. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",
Flanagan F.,Symposium on work in the 'gig' economy: Introduction,2017,"This introduction overviews four approaches to theoretical and empirical research on the 'gig' economy, framing them within the concept of the 'fissuring of the workplace'. It outlines arguments that 'gig' or digital work is not a new phenomenon but a resurgence of older, unregulated labour extraction methods and outlines the need for a more nuanced way of measuring the dimensions of job insecurity and their corrosive effects. In foreshadowing potential policy approaches to addressing the regulatory deficit surrounding gig economy work, it argues for an eclectic approach to using and strengthening legislation designed to safeguard the rights of consumers and providers of services, including contractors, and regardless of employment status. Finally, it foreshadows a study of how a successful union movement respond to the gig economy - negotiation with a digital platform to bring advertised hourly pay rates into line with the minima set within the industrial relations system for employment in the relevant industries. © The Author(s) 2017.",'gig' economy; Fissured workplace; standard employment relationship (SER)

"Stewart A., Stanford J.",Regulating work in the gig economy: What are the options?,2017,"Paid work associated with digital platform businesses (in taxi, delivery, maintenance and other functions) embodies features which complicate the application of traditional labour regulations and employment standards. This article reviews the extent of this type of work in Australia, and its main characteristics. It then considers the applicability of existing employment regulations to these 'gig' jobs, citing both Australian and international legislation and case law. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the scope of traditional regulations, minimum standards and remedies in the realm of irregular digitally mediated work. Regulators and policymakers should consider how to strengthen and expand the regulatory framework governing gig work. The article notes five major options in this regard: enforcement of existing laws; clarifying or expanding definitions of 'employment'; creating a new category of 'independent worker'; creating rights for 'workers', not employees; and reconsidering the concept of an 'employer'. We review the pros and cons of these approaches and urge regulators to be creative and ambitious in better protecting the minimum standards and conditions of workers in these situations. © The Author(s) 2017.",Digital work; gig jobs; labour regulation; precarity; risk
"Zeng J., Simpson C., Dang B.-L.",A Process Model of Dynamic Capability Development: Evidence from the Chinese Manufacturing Sector,2017,"Based on longitudinal case studies of manufacturing strategy and implementation at two Chinese manufacturing firms, this paper investigates how these firms develop, manage, and deploy dynamic capabilities to renew their resource bases in order to respond to the operational challenges associated with radical technological development. Our analysis suggests that dynamic capability development is not simply about renewing one specific type of capability, but rather, it is a meta-capability to learn how to repeatedly renew the firm's overall capability set as a fully integrated package. We further highlight the importance of looking beyond the property of the firm to understand the network level of capability development, including the capabilities of the firm's partners. This is particularly salient in the context of smart manufacturing where a high level of connectivity among a broader network of partners is required to reap the benefits generated by new technological advances. Our findings provide an important contribution to our knowledge of dynamic capability development in emerging economies in the era of digitalized manufacturing. © Copyright The International Association for Chinese Management Research 2017.",China; digital manufacturing; dynamic capability development; emerging economies
"Tanoue Y., Yamashita S.",When banks venture beyond home turf: Consequences for loan performance,2017,"Depopulation in provincial areas has recently caused a decline in regional economies in Japan. Japanese regional banks have thus been advancing into areas outside their original operational bases, especially into major cities and urban regions. Since lending to areas outside the original operational base is inherently more uncertain (and increasing), such lending behavior is expected to significantly affect the credit risk of regional banks’ lending portfolios. In this paper, we analyze the extent to which the lending area (the local region, outside the local region or Tokyo) affects the credit risk of regional banks. By using credit data on five regional banks, we develop credit risk estimation models to analyze the effect of the characteristics of lending area. These analyses indicate that the lending area variables affect credit risk; default is less likely to occur outside the local region and in Tokyo; and the loss given default is smaller in the local region than elsewhere. © 2017 Infopro Digital Risk (IP) Limited.",Bank loan; Credit risk; Lending area; Loss given default; Probability of default
Welfens P.J.J.,An accidental Brexit: New EU and transatlantic economic perspectives,2017,"This book analyzes how the EU referendum in the United Kingdom came to pass and what the foreseeable consequences are for the UK, Europe, US and world economy. The Brexit decision represents a momentous event for Europe, which weakens the EU and shifts the global balance of power. Welfens argues the EU has lost its appeal and is not in keeping with the twenty-first century, which is being shaped by Asia and digital innovations. The subject of immigration from EU countries played a key role in the Brexit decision, with an anti-EU campaign that was profoundly biased. The estimated impact of the referendum was deeply distorted by the broadly inadequate information produced by the Cameron government, which omitted the expected 10 percent loss in income caused by leaving the EU. With this this information, there could have been a clear pro-EU majority. In the absence of a second referendum, one cannot know what the British electorate really wants. Both the Brexit decision and new President of the United States Donald Trump's approach to European disintegration dynamics also raise serious questions about the future of transatlantic relations. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2017.",

Pulkka V.-V.,A free lunch with robots – can a basic income stabilise the digital economy?,2017,"The discussion on the possible implications of the digital economy for labour continues unabated. An essential dimension of the discussion is the widely shared view that a basic income could guarantee sufficient purchasing power for unemployed, underemployed and precarious workers should technological unemployment and labour market insecurity increase. A budget-neutral basic income has serious limitations as an economic stabilisation grant, but if financing proposals are revised, these limitations can be tackled. Even though guaranteeing sufficient purchasing power for unemployed, underemployed and precarious workers does not necessarily require an unconditional universal benefit, it seems clear that traditional activation based on strict means-testing and obligations will not be a strategy flexible enough to guarantee sufficient consumer demand in fluctuating labour markets. An economically sustainable solution might be to reduce means-testing gradually and to study carefully the effects. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",Automation; basic income; digital economy; employment; negative income tax; precarious jobs; technological unemployment; underemployment

However, such predictions ignore the fact that the growth crisis of contemporary capitalism is mainly a result of weak private demand. I argue that digitalisation represents a macro-strategy for economic transformation explicitly tackling this aspect. However, while several strategies aimed at rationalising consumption can be observed in leading digital economy companies, instead of solving the consumption problem by increasing demand, they tend to exacerbate the structural weakness of consumption. I coin the term ‘consumption dilemma’ to mark this phenomenon and briefly stress its implications for union policies. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",Amazon; capitalism; consumption; Digitalisation; Google; political economy; rationalisation

"Keister R., Lewandowski P.",A routine transition in the digital era? The rise of routine work in Central and Eastern Europe,2017,"In this article, we study the shift from manual to cognitive work in 10 Central and Eastern European economies. While highlighting the growth in the non-routine cognitive component of jobs, we pay particular attention to the increase in routine cognitive tasks, a trend distinguishing Central and Eastern European economies from the most advanced economies. We find that in all countries routine cognitive tasks were most common in the middle of wage distribution, but increasingly rare among the top earners. We identify two groups of workers whose jobs depend most on performing routine cognitive tasks: medium-skilled men in the manufacturing sectors and medium-skilled women in the service sectors, who jointly represent 33 per cent of Central and Eastern European workers. Should technological progress reduce demand for routine work in Central and Eastern Europe, a large proportion of workers would be affected and wage inequality would rise. We conclude with the policy implications of our findings. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",Central and Eastern Europe; routinisation; Task content of jobs
Ilsøe A.,"The digitalisation of service work – social partner responses in Denmark, Sweden and Germany",2017,"The discussion on the digitalisation of work has intensified in recent years. The literature points to two main trends accelerated by digitalisation – work automation that eliminates or changes job functions, and the creation of work without jobs via digital platforms. This article addresses the question as to how social partners define digitalisation of work and their perception of its consequences, while also looking at their recent responses to it. Drawing on interviews with unions and employers' organisations in Denmark, Sweden and Germany, it examines social partner initiatives in the unilateral, tripartite and bipartite arenas on various forms of neo-corporatist labour market regulation. The focus is on service work in the private sector, an area of the economy currently under pressure from both automation and the trend towards work without jobs. Whereas the social partners seem to be very active in the unilateral arena in all three countries, responses differ in the tripartite and bipartite arenas. The article concludes by discussing the strengths and weaknesses of the responses in the face of current digitalisation trends and existing models of labour market regulation. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",Denmark; Digitalisation; Germany; private sector; service work; social dialogue; Sweden

This paper addresses how the Australian construction industry has kept up with the pace of digitization compared with other industries in Australia. The data is drawn mainly from the national accounts hosted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, within the time period of 1995–2015. Construction has developed into one of the most important industries in Australia. Together with mining and the financial and insurance sector, it has contributed to a significant gross added value (GVA) in the economy. The construction industry has invested around 1% or less in information and communication technologies (ICT) as their share of GVA; however, it has invested about 15% in ICT of their total investments (gross fixed capital formation). Among the selected industries, construction's labour productivity measured by GVA per hour was the third highest, despite low level of investments in digitization. The observed correlation between ICT investments and productivity is weak when using industry level data from the national accounts. Any big leap towards digitization is not recognised for the construction industry; rather there appears to be steady acceptance of the technology. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Australia; Construction; Digitization; Productivity

"Davies A.R., Donald B., Gray M., Knox-Hayes J.",Sharing economies: Moving beyond binaries in a digital age,2017,"In periods of turbulence, the tendency to simplify messages and polarise debates is nothing new. In our hyper-mediated world of online technologies, where it seems that even national policy can be forged in the 140 characters of Twitter, it is more important than ever to retain spaces for in-depth debate of emergent phenomena that have disruptive and transformative potential. In this article, we follow this logic and argue that to fully understand the diverse range of practices and potential consequences of activities uncomfortably corralled under the ambiguous term 'the sharing economy' requires not a simplification of arguments, but an opening out of horizons to explore the many ways in which these phenomena have emerged and are evolving. It is argued that this will require attention to multiple terrains, from diverse intellectual traditions across many disciplines to the thus far largely reactive responses of government and regulation, and from the world of techno-innovation start-ups to the optics of media (including social media) reporting on what it means to 'share' in the 21st century. Building on this, we make the case for viewing 'the sharing economy' as a matrix of diverse economies with clear links to past practices. We propose that to build a grammar for understanding these diverse sharing economies requires further attention to: (1) The etymology of sharing and sharing economies; (2) The differentiated geographies to which sharing economies contribute; (3) What it means to labour, work and be employed in sharing economies; (4) The role of the state and others in governing, regulating and shaping the organisation and practice of sharing economies; and (5) the impacts of sharing economies. In conclusion, we suggest that while media interest may fade as their presence in everyday lives becomes less novel, understanding sharing economies remains an urgent activity if we are to ensure that the new ways of living and labouring, to which sharing economies are contributing, work to promote sustainable and inclusive development in this world that ultimately we all share. © The Author 2017.

Moral sentiments-and especially what Adam Smith called the sense of propriety, the sense of merit and the sense of justice-play a productive role in organizing the extraction of economic value. Conversely, relative valuations in the economy (prices, for instance) can be thought of as moral engines that reward or sanction certain behaviors, and are presumed to index underlying moral differences. Economic value is produced both when individuals are morally aligned with the rational goals of capitalism, and when they perform unhinged deviations from the moral standard. I show how modern digital capitalism organizes profit extraction through these twin processes of alignment and unhingement, building new economic moralities in the process-moral sentiments that are the result of people's interactions with opaque but powerful forms of behavioral fine-tuning, surveillance and manipulation. © The Author 2016.

The emergence of mobile phone media solves the deficiencies of the traditional marketing mode in the aspects of creativity, interactivity, accuracy, service and marketing network and becomes a new marketing mode for medical devices. Mobile phone media based marketing improves the popularity of medical device enterprises, help establish good corporate image, enhances the sales volume of medical device products, and increase profits, which attributes to its advantages that is distinguished it with traditional media.

This challenges us to think beyond these traditional binaries and to conceptualise a more blurred, less analytically clean and more circular approach to studying consumption. © The Author(s) 2015.",digital consumption; ethical consumption; practices; prosumption; recycling; Sustainable consumption

The understanding of risks and challenges is relevant for the design of effective and balanced European public policies for innovation and competitiveness in an ever-more intangible and creative economy. This work seeks to give a preliminary approach to a decisive lack of knowledge on the mechanisms of creative/cultural regional innovation policies. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

"García-Muñiz A.S., Vicente M.R.",Assessing the economic potential of big data industries,2017,"Information and communication technologies have made possible that data can be collected and processed at rates previously unseen. It is the big data phenomenon, which holds potential to boost innovation and improve productivity growth. This chapter attempts to provide some evidence of the strengths and challenges faced by big data industries. Attention is focused on the position that these industries hold within the economic network in terms of their access to information and knowledge. To achieve this aim, network analysis is used over input-output table information. Given the absence of appropriate statistical data for developing countries, attention is paid to two developed countries, Slovenia and Slovakia, which show some common features in their patterns of digital development with some developing countries. Results show that while the levels of efficiency of these industries are high, they are missing some key economic links with other sectors of the economy. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

Gregory M.A.,A time for renewal editorial,2017,"The Telecommunications Association has commenced the second phase of the renewal process that started in 2013. As part of the first phase of this renewal process a key decision was to relaunch the Telecommunications Journal of Australia as the Australian Journal of Telecommunications and the Digital Economy. In addition to the Journal, the Telecommunications Association holds the Henry Sutton and Charles Todd Orations each year in Melbourne and Sydney respectively. As the second phase progresses, the Telecommunications Association will launch a new brand, update the Association's website and host the first of what should become an annual two-day telecommunications forum. The first event is to be held in Melbourne in November. For the Journal, key milestones have now been achieved, including being added to the SCOPUS list of indexed Journals and the Australian Research Council's Excellence in Research for Australia, which is the national research evaluation framework.

"Den Hartog F., De Nijs J.",The role of regulation in preventing Wi-Fi over-congestion in densely populated areas,2017,"Given the ever increasing number of Wi-Fi devices in use by the public, the progressing urbanisation, and the current attempts by the industry to improve Wi-Fi system performance, we here analyse the case of apartment blocks with residents increasingly suffering from Wi-Fi over-congestion. Here, individuals use private Wi-Fi networks in an ""in house"" environment to achieve cordless connectivity to the Internet. We show that Wi-Fi in apartment blocks is a true commons and, therefore, over-congestion can only be avoided by having the individual access point (AP) operators collaborating with each other. We found that such collaboration is not inhibited by current regulation, but neither can it be enforced. However, as AP operators will most likely enter collaboration voluntarily, further regulation is not deemed necessary.

"Kennedy J., Armitage G., Thomas J.",Household bandwidth and the 'need for speed' Evaluating the impact of active queue management for home internet traffic,2017,"In this paper, we aim to contribute to the policy debate on bandwidth needs by considering more closely what happens in household networks. We draw upon both social and technical studies modelling household applications and their uses to show how queue management protocols impact bandwidth needs. We stress the impact of internet traffic streams interfering with each other, and describe three different categories of internet traffic. We demonstrate how the use of active queue management can reduce bandwidth demands. In doing so we consider how, and to what degree, household internet connections are a constraint on internet use. We show that speed demand predictions are skewed by a perceived need to protect the Quality of Service experienced by latency-sensitive services when using current gateway technologies.

"Steane T.N.E., Radcliffe P.J.",An Evaluation and Enhancement of a Novel IoT Joining Protocol,2017,"The ability to securely join IoT Devices to Wi-Fi networks is an ongoing area of research. This paper describes how Nasrin & Radcliffe's theoretical ""novel minimalist IoT network joining protocol"" has been mapped to real world hardware and implemented using the Android operating system. For the first time the theory is proven to be practically viable but it is also shown that the user interface is not sufficiently simple for the everyday user. This paper proposes and implements a new user interface paradigm that dramatically simplifies the process and makes the joining process accessible to a much larger range of users. For intensely cost-sensitive applications an alternative process is proposed that has the possibility of even further simplifying the user experience. Finally, the compatibility of the protocol with a variety of operating systems is assessed.

Hormann P.,Making ICT decommissioning sexy challenges and opportunities,2017,"The author contends that the ICT industry has become good at accumulating large inventories of ICT systems without paying sufficient attention to the associated technical debt and cost. He has experienced organisations that have repeatedly failed to retire old systems, are struggling to modernise, are burdened by complexity and can't change at a pace demanded by their internal stakeholders and their customers. Why is this case and why isn't the decision to switch off ageing, low business value, poor strategic fit and high-risk systems an easy and obvious business case? This paper explores the challenges of decommissioning decision making and uses a framework and case study analysis as a means to improve the timeliness and financial motivations. It should be of interest to ICT and business executives that struggle with balancing a tight budget around existing systems, with the need to invest in systems modernisation to maintain organisation competitiveness and productivity.

Dewar K.,The value exchange: Generating trust in the digital world,2017,"Data is highly valuable to an organisation and in a data-driven economy a company’s ability to analyse and extract insights from data, to find patterns and trends and new revenue streams, dictates strategies and competitive advantage. Running parallel to this is a growing resistance from individuals towards the organisations who hold their data. Their mistrust in organisations is increasing, partly because many have displayed a severe lack of transparency about how they use and store individuals’ data. A few organisations have even misused individuals’ data to a point where all trust is destroyed. It’s led to a growing number of individuals reducing the information they share, and, in some cases, entirely blocking its use. In May 2018, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will require all organisations to become compliant with new regulations on data collection and use.

Campbell I.,Fact or fraud? The epidemic which struck telecom Australia from 1983 to 1986,2017,"Epidemic - a widespread occurrence of an infectious disease in a community at a particular time - outbreak, scourge, plague. About 1976 concerns emerged in Australia about the potential for new technologies to seriously reduce employment. The debate reached a peak in 1978 when industrial action taken by the Australian Telecommunications Employees Association (ATEA) threatened to shut down the Australian telecommunications network. From 1975 growth in calls to the directory assistance service rocketed as did the related operating costs. To maintain the quality of customer service and contain operating costs, Telecom began to deploy a nation-wide computer-based directory assistance system (DAS/C) from 1982. In 1983 an unexpected medical syndrome arose in one of Telecom's directory assistance centres. Over the next three years, the syndrome rapidly spread through other directory assistance centres, other areas of Telecom and some areas of the public service. The media, academia, legal practitioners and others attracted to the ""problem"" generally accepted the union view that the DAS/C system was the cause and the syndrome was labelled Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI). Medical costs and compensation claims mounted reaching $130 million in 1989. While RSI has become a well-known syndrome over the last 40 years, no outbreaks of the extent and severity experienced in Telecom appear to have been recorded over that period anywhere in the world. There still appears to be little scientific evidence of the link between the injury of the reported scale and the workplace. This is the story of the rise of the RSI phenomena in Telecom over the period 1983-86.

Drawing on a multi-year study with digital workers in Sub-Saharan Africa and South-east Asia, this article highlights four key concerns for workers: bargaining power, economic inclusion, intermediated value chains, and upgrading. The article shows that although there are important and tangible benefits for a range of workers, there are also a range of risks and costs that unduly affect the livelihoods of digital workers. Building on those concerns, it then concludes with a reflection on four broad strategies – certification schemes, organising digital workers, regulatory strategies and democratic control of online labour platforms – that could be employed to improve conditions and livelihoods for digital workers. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",digital labour; digital work; economic development; freelancing; Gig economy; online labour markets; outsourcing; precarity

Todolí-Signes A.,"The ‘gig economy’: employee, self-employed or the need for a special employment regulation?",2017,"The digital era has changed employment relationships dramatically, causing a considerable degree of legal uncertainty as to which rules apply in cyberspace. Technology is transforming business organisation in a way that makes employees – as subordinate workers – less necessary. New types of companies, based on the ‘on-demand economy’ or so-called ‘sharing economy’ and dedicated to connecting customers directly with individual service providers, are emerging. These companies conduct their entire core business through workers that they classify as self-employed. In this context, employment law is facing its greatest challenge, as it has to deal with a very different reality to the one existing when it was created. This article analyses the literature available about the classification of this new type of worker as an employee or as self-employed, concluding that there is a need for a new special labour regulation. It also describes and justifies the bases for this new special labour regulation. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",economic dependency; employment contract; gig economy; gig economy; legal concept of employee; Outsourcing; self-employment; Uber economy; ‘sharing’ economy

The article then explores the possibility of extending to crowdworkers the protections offered by collective bargaining and addresses how trade unions could have a role in implementing guarantees for crowdworkers. Comparative analysis is used to show how different constitutional systems recognise freedom of association, especially in relation to ‘subordinated’ workers.

In this paper,we seek to understand and measure the causal impact of tablets on e-commerce sales. In doing so, we examine the complementary and substitution impact of the tablet channel on the smartphone and PC channels. We rely on a unique data set from Alibaba, the largest e-commerce firm in the world, and exploit a natural experiment via the iPad app introduction to empirically identify our results. The results show that users' adoption of tablets enhanced the overall growth of Alibaba's e-commerce market, with an annual increase of approximately US$923.5 million. Our results demonstrate that the tablet channel acts as a substitute for the PC channel while it acts as a complement for the smartphone channel. Furthermore, the use of tablets spurs casual browsing, which leads to the purchase of more impulse products and a wider diversity of products. Cross-device browsing behavior is found to enhance sales outcomes, and the degree of interrelationships between devices varies across the course of the day. We provide insights for retailers about how they can increase their sales volume and revenue in the emerging tablet economy. © Copyright 2016 INFORMS.",Channels; Internet commerce; Long tail; Mobile; Natural experiment

It is not necessarily the offerings of a sharing economy that serve individuals in analogy to their share in a corresponding manner.

Flügge B.,Introduction,2017,"How to address a trend that is overarching and embraces many distinct addressees and disciplines such as Smart Mobility? What is happening behind the scenes? Often labeled as Intelligent Mobility, Mobility-as-a-Service or Mobility 4.0, and understood as autonomous driving or intermodal traffic management, Smart Mobility has many faces and focus areas depending on local contexts and needs. Decision makers in cities, rural areas and federal institutions now have the opportunity to prepare the ground so that everyone and everybody benefits. Smart Mobility, therefore, should be seen as a visionary and feasible offering that influences our present and our future - regardless of our budgets, capabilities, competences, and needs, regardless of where the demand is being generated and where it is being fulfilled. Mobility is all about freedom. Regardless of whether we are considering a person or an object, a group of people or a demand fulfilment process, mobility is all about being maneuverable in one or multiple geographies. How to make it real in the digital age is all about connectivity, taking chances, and transforming constraints into opportunities. The essential elements are all there. Throughout numerous initiatives about intelligently connected cities - also referred to as smart cities or new cities - mobility has found a terminological home as one of the six design elements of a Smart City [1, p. 9]. The other five elements are Smart Governance, Smart People, Smart Living, Smart Economy, and Smart Environment.

"Bonini T., Pais I.",Hacking Public Service Media Funding: A Scenario for Rethinking the License Fee as a Form of Civic Crowdfunding,2017,"The current article analyzes the difficulties faced by public service media in the current political, economic and multimedia context. It proceeds with an examination of the main financing methods used by public service media and of the most recent reforms at the European level. The last part of this article describes a potential “scenario” of reforming public service media license fee model through the dynamics of civic crowdfunding, allowing citizens to decide in which programs they may invest a (20%) quota. The scenario we have built is framed in the direction of a “digitally enabled collaborative economy” (Kostakis and Bauwens, 2014), where citizens can experiment with a form of participation in media that is no longer “content-related” but “structural” (Carpentier, 2011). In order to prove the value of this hypothesis, the model has been tested on 649 Italian citizens. This test demonstrated that, although 83% of the survey sample believe the current cost of the Italian license fee is too high, 70% of them would be willing to pay even more if they could be in control of a part of the license fee and decide where to invest it. Therefore, we have shown that our sample of Italian citizens and Internet users is favorably disposed toward forms of more structural participation in the decision-making processes of public service media and in the co-management of public service media budgets. The aim of the current article is to demonstrate the potential value of audience’ structural participation in reshaping the role of public service media in contemporary digital cultures and networked societies. © 2017 Institute for Media and Communications Management.",

Savelyev A.,Legal aspects of ownership in modified open source software and its impact on Russian software import substitution policy,2017,"In my previous publication, I tried to show how personal data legislation might be used for achieving the purposes of national sovereignty1 Alexander Savelyev. Russia's new personal data localization regulations: A step forward or a self-imposed sanction? // [2016] 32 Computer Law &amp; Security Review 128–145. In this paper, I will demonstrate how open source software may be used for achieving similar purposes. However, the interplay between local copyright law, public procurement law and open source community norms creates many issues relating to the legal status and ownership in modified software, based on open source. This is especially so in the case of so-called copyleft open source licenses, where a collision occurs between copyright, as an absolute right enforceable against the world, and the copyleft provisions of license agreements, which may be treated as “rights in personam” enforceable only against the licensee. The exclusive right to derivative software as an independent object of copyright, may come into conflict with restrictions inherited from incoming copyleft licenses. This paper provides an overview and analysis of such problems faced by Russian software developers, attempting to comply with Russian import substitution provisions, by using open source components. Although it is based on Russian law, it may be applicable to other jurisdictions, since general aspects of copyright law and its interaction with private international law and contract law drive it. The paper concludes that the developer of software, containing code licensed under GPL or other copyleft provisions, receives full exclusive right to the derivative software and can commercialize it as he sees appropriate, subject only to possible claims of breach of contract rather than copyright infringement. This opens wide perspectives for using open source components regardless of the type of license used as bricks for building a de-globalized economy and society based on principles of information sovereignty. © 2017 Alexander Savelyev",Derivative computer program; Import substitution; Information sovereignty; Lex protectionis; Open source software
"Byrne D., Oliner S.D., Sichel D.E.","Prices of high-tech products, mismeasurement, and the pace of innovation",2017,"Introduction: Two recent papers have made compelling cases that mismeasurement of prices of high-tech products cannot explain the slow pace of labor productivity growth that has prevailed since the mid-2000s. Does that result indicate that mismeasurement of high-tech products has limited implications for patterns of economic growth? The answer in this paper is ""no."". Results: We demonstrate that the understatement of price declines for high-tech products in official measures has a dramatic effect on the pattern of multifactor productivity (MFP) growth across sectors. In particular, we show that correcting this mismeasurement implies faster MFP growth in high-tech sectors and slower MFP advance outside the high-tech sector. If MFP growth is taken as a rough proxy for the pace of innovation, our results suggest that innovation in the tech sector has been more rapid than the rate that would be inferred from official statistics (and less rapid outside high-tech). Conclusion: These results deepen the productivity puzzle. If the pace of innovation in high-tech sectors has been more rapid than indicated by official statistics, then it is perhaps even more puzzling that overall labor productivity growth has been so sluggish in recent years. © 2017 National Association for Business Economics.",Digital economy; High-tech sector; Measurement; Multifactor productivity; Productivity; Productivity slowdown

However only few research have addressed this phenomenon to enterprises digital eco-system by adopting mainly a qualitatively approach. We point out that the relevance of the digital eco-system focusing on the role of social networking sites in relationship to innovation and knowledge. The use of social networking sites can provide a wealth of information about individuals and their networks, which can be utilised for various business purposes. It enables enterprises to create online communities and share user-created content. Within this context, enterprises actively interact with external actors such as customers, public institutions, and other businesses to acquire and absorb external knowledge, and then generate innovation. To gain insights from the global economy, 215 small to medium enterprises from different sets of global enterprises, both knowledge-intensive (e.g. management consulting, marketing and advertising, ICT and related services, legal and technical services) and labour-intensive (such as high tech and electronics, food and beverage, and consumer durables), were analysed. Via the Partial Least Square-Path Modelling the relationships between social networking sites, absorptive capacity, and innovation performance were measured. Therefore, recommendations are proffered as to what small-medium enterprises should do in order to enhance their innovativeness.

"de Geofroy Z., Evans M.M.",Are Emotionally Intelligent Employees Less Likely to Hide Their Knowledge?,2017,"In today's knowledge-intensive economy, organizations are constantly faced with new challenges to be more innovative (Salaman & Storey,). Therefore, they have increasingly viewed knowledge management (KM) as an important strategy. Many have even implemented explicit knowledge sharing (KS) practices in an attempt to maintain their competitive advantage and improve performance (Hsu, Law & Ngai,). However, much of the knowledge utilized by the organization is out of its control since it is held and managed at the individual level. Moreover, employees often choose to conceal this knowledge (Connelly et al., Peng, Connelly & Zweig, Demirkasimoglu,) a phenomenon known as knowledge hiding (KH). This paper reviews the literature on KH and on Emotional Intelligence (EI) theory and practice, arguing that there is a potential connection between the two. Specifically, KH may be reduced, through increased teamwork, trust, and organizational commitment, which are all outcomes of high EI in employees. A narrative overview approach (Green et al.,) was used to find, synthesize, and review the literature. A search of the available research literature was performed across some of the major digital library sources including the Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), Emerald, Google Scholar and ProQuest databases. A meta-synthesis was then used to integrate, evaluate, and interpret the findings. The resulting review provides a summary of the current literature and offers a rationale for conducting future research. This paper is useful for both academics and practitioners who are concerned with the incorporation of EI practices into their KM strategies. It could also provide further insight into organizational KM strategy, specifically relating to hiring, training, and promoting KM processes. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

For this purpose, an appropriate methodology was designed, in order to include the most of the aforementioned factors. Emphasis was given to questions which can illustrate the level of technological innovation with actions and initiatives like digital marketing, innovative ability and others. Therefore, a questionnaire was created and was then applied to many regions in northern Greece. In respect of data analysis, the contribution of Correspondence Analysis (CA), a method from the multidimensional statistics field, was crucial because it easily revealed the characteristics that intensively differentiated themselves. The above methodologies and their special characteristics facilitated also the implementation of SWOT analysis. In the case of the Regional Units examined in the current research, the positive and negative factors-points were easily revealed and presented. © 2017, IGI Global. All rights reserved.",
Choi Y.,Digital business and sustainable development: Asian perspectives,2017,"The Internet has ushered in a new era in the economies of networking. With the increasing need for optimization based on these network economies, the IT-based e-business has become a platform for study as well as daily practice. In a similar vein, global warming has raised many issues which come into conflict with traditional research and policies. The Internet revolution has also shifted our society from a government- and company-led economy to a 'netizen'- and consumer-led business world. This book enlightens us on why a harmonized participation of traditional network members or interested groups is necessary and how we can create values from diverse fields of interests and objectives, including the corporate social responsibility (CSR) and eco-friendly productivity. Digital Business and Sustainable Development integrates the platforms from these two fields of study based on the comparative analysis of Asian and other developing countries. © 2017 Yongrok Choi.

In order to fulfil the defined purpose, the method of snowball sampling was employed. The results of the research revealed that consumers interpret digital shadow economy as an illegal operation in the Internet space, which generates illegal money flows for commodity/service providers or purchasers, and deprives legal traders/service providers from the revenue that could be officially accounted, calculated and declared. E-shops, social networks and websites are the channels, most commonly engaged for acquisition of goods/services in digital space; the categories of goods/services acquired by these channels include clothing and footwear, trips and entertainment, cosmetics and perfume. Purification of the concept of digital shadow economy from consumers’ position allowed to define the concept of digital shadow economy, which is a significant contribution to the evolution of the theory of digital shadow economy, and can enable to develop an instrument for measuring the scopes of digital shadow economy in further research. © 2017 Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press.",concept of digital shadow economy; consumers; digital shadow economy; motives/factors of digital shadow economy; shadow economy; snowball sampling

While preferential trade agreements and regional institutional cooperation have been important stepping stones in the catching up process of many economies in the region, we argue that other drivers should be considered for the following years. Looking at the case study of Vietnam we therefore firstly account for its historical process of integration in the regional and global economy by way of the international agreements. This allows us to understand the relative positioning of this country in the world market. We subsequently develop an in-depth analysis of the current drivers for economic integration and internationalization. We argue that Vietnam's potential in the digital economy is distinctive in the Indochina region, and we develop a systematic analysis of the market trends. © 2017, IGI Global. All rights reserved.",
"Spiekermann S., Korunovska J.",Towards a value theory for personal data,2017,"Analysts, investors and entrepreneurs have recognized the value of personal data for Internet economics. Personal data is viewed as 'the oil' of the digital economy. Yet, ordinary people are barely aware of this. Marketers collect personal data at minimal cost in exchange for free services. But will this be possible in the long term, especially in the face of privacy concerns? Little is known about how users really value their personal data. In this paper, we build a user-centered value theory for personal data. On the basis of a survey experiment with 1269 Facebook users, we identify core constructs that drive the value of volunteered personal data. We find that privacy concerns are less influential than expected and influence data value mainly when people become aware of data markets. In fact, the consciousness of data being a tradable asset is the single most influential factor driving willingness-to-pay for data. Furthermore, we find that people build a sense of psychological ownership for their data and hence value it more. Finally, our value theory helps to unveil market design mechanisms that will influence how personal data markets thrive: First, we observe a majority of users become reactant if they are consciously deprived of control over their personal data; many drop out of the market. We therefore advice companies to consider user-centered data control tools to have them participate in personal data markets. Second, we find that in order to create scarcity in the market, centralized IT architectures (reducing multiple data copies) may be beneficial. © 2016 JIT Palgrave Macmillan.",Data protection; Data valuation; Personal data markets; Privacy; Psychological ownership; WTP

"Brown J.R., Martinsson G., Petersen B.C.",What promotes R&D? Comparative evidence from around the world,2017,"R&D drives innovation and productivity growth, but appropriability problems and financing difficulties likely keep R&D investment well below the socially optimal level, particularly in high- technology industries. Though countries around the world are increasingly interested in using tax incentives and other policy initiatives to address this underinvestment problem, there is little empirical evidence comparing the effectiveness of alternative domestic policies and institutions at spurring R&D. Using data from a broad sample of OECD economies, we find that financial market rules that improve accounting standards and strengthen contract enforcement share a significant positive relation with R&D in more innovative industries, as do stronger legal protections for intellectual property. In contrast, stronger creditor rights and more generous R&D tax credits have a negative differential relation with R&D in more innovative industries. These results suggest that domestic policies directly dealing with appropriability and financing problems may be more effective than traditional tax subsides at promoting the innovative investments that drive economic growth. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Financial markets; Intellectual property protection; R & D tax credits; R & D, innovation; Technological change"
Bheemaiah K.,The Blockchain alternative: Rethinking macroeconomic policy and economic theory,2017,"Examine what would happen if we were to deploy blockchain technology at the sovereign level and use it to create a decentralized cashless economy. This book explains how finance and economics work today, and how the convergence of various technologies related to the financial sector can help us find solutions to problems, such as excessive debt creation, banks getting too big to fail, and shadow banking. The Blockchain Alternative offers sensible corrections to outdated and incorrect dogmas, such as the efficient markets hypothesis and rational expectations theory. You'll also be introduced to universal basic income, the consequences of going cashless, why complexity economics needs to be understood and what kinds of tools and theories you'll need to redefine the existing definition of capitalism. While the book does discuss technologies and methods that are primed for our future, a number of references are made to economic history and the works of great thinkers from a different era. You'll see how the blockchain can be used to deploy solutions that were devised in the past, but which can serve as the antidote to our current economic malaises. You'll discover that what is required today is not an adaptation of the old theories, but a new methodology that is suited to this new era. Without undertaking such an endeavor, one will always be burdened with a definition of capitalism that is out of kilter with the evolution of our digital humanity. What would this mean to monetary and fiscal policy, market structure and our current understanding of economics? More importantly would we need to change our current understanding of capitalism? And if we were to change our perceptions, what would the future version look like? This book answers these questions, and analyses some of the most pertinent issues of our generation. © 2017 by Kariappa Bheemaiah. All rights reserved.",

"Lobo S., Whyte J.",Aligning and Reconciling: Building project capabilities for digital delivery,2017,"Digital delivery of complex projects, using integrated software and processes, is an important emerging phenomenon as it transforms relationships across the associated ecology of project-based firms. Our study analyses how a project-based firm, ‘Global Engineering’, builds new project capabilities for digital delivery through work on three major road and railway infrastructure projects. We find that it seeks to: (1) align the project set-up with the firm's existing capabilities; and (2) reconcile differing agendas and capabilities in collaborating firms across the project ecology. Here, aligning involves influencing the set-up of digital delivery and renegotiating that set-up during project implementation; and reconciling involves managing across multiple digital systems; accommodating and learning other firms’ software and processes; and using digital technologies to create shared identity across the firms involved in delivery. We argue that creating relative stability enables firms to use existing, and build new, project capabilities, and hence aligning and reconciling are important to project-based firms in environments where there is high interdependence across heterogeneous firms and rapid technological change. We find that building these capabilities involves both ‘economies of repetition’ and ‘economies of recombination’; the former enabling the firm to capture value by mobilizing existing resources and the latter, requiring additional work to re-combine existing and new resources. Our study thus provides insight into how project-based firms build project capabilities for the digital delivery of complex projects in order to remain competitive in their existing markets, and has broader implications for learning in the project ecologies associated with these projects. © 2016 The Authors",Complex projects; Digital delivery; Infrastructure; Learning; Project capabilities; Project-based firm
"Watanabe C., Naveed K., Neittaanmäki P., Fox B.",Consolidated challenge to social demand for resilient platforms - Lessons from Uber's global expansion,2017,"Many in the industry see the ride-sharing company Uber as the significant advancement through information and communication technology (ICT) particularly of the digital service platform and sharing economy. Uber has been exploring the new frontier of the ICT-driven disruptive business model (IDBM) and succeeded in its global expansion to over 479 cities in more than 75 countries worldwide in June of 2016. Such rapid expansion provides constructive insights regarding the significance of IDBM, not only in transportation but also in almost all other business fields. While at the same time Uber's legal battles in some cities around the world raise a serious question regarding the rationale of IDBM. In light of such a question, this paper examined the institutional sources contrasting success and failure in Uber's global expansion. By the comparative empirical analysis, it was identified that the contrast could be attributed to a bi-polarization nature of ICT-driven logistic growth, and the success can be attributed to a co-evolutionary acclimatization that harnesses the vigor of counterparts. This analysis suggests the significance of IDBM with a consolidated challenge to social demand (CCSD); it demonstrated that a co-evolutionary acclimatization played a transformative role in this accomplishment. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Co-evolutionary acclimatization; Consolidated challenge to social demand; Digital service platform; ICT-driven disruptive business model; Legal battles; Sharing economy; Uber's global expansion

Two of the most popular contemporary companions to Marx’s Capital, the ones by David Harvey and Michael Heinrich, present themselves as general guidebooks on how to read Marx, but are actually biased towards particular schools of Marxist thought. A contemporary reading of Marx needs to be mediated with contemporary capitalism’s structures and the political issues of the day.

"Watanabe C., Naveed K., Neittaanmäki P.",Co-evolution between trust in teachers and higher education toward digitally-rich learning environments,2017,"Based on a powerful notion that the quality of higher education is crucial for innovation in digital economy and that such quality is subject to a conception of trust in teachers to deliver good education and advancement of information and communication technology (ICT), the dynamism of co-evolution between them was analyzed. Using a unique dataset representing the above system consisting of the rate of trust in teachers providing good education in the context of quality of education and their social status, of the level of higher education and the state of ICT advancement toward digitally-rich learning environments, an empirical numerical analysis of 20 countries was attempted. These countries were classified as advanced, semi-advanced and growing. It was found that while ICT advanced countries have embarked on co-evolution of ICT, higher education and trust, ICT growing countries have not been successful in this due to a vicious cycle between ICT and trust. Finland's educational success can be attributed to co-evolution which corresponds to the emergence of un-captured GDP similarly to the leading edge of an ICT-driven disruptive business model. The paradox of education productivity in ICT growing countries can be attributed to disengagement. It is suggested that steady ICT advancement fully utilizing external resources in digitally-rich learning environments may be essential to ICT growing countries in achieving higher education. On the other hand, continuing transcending innovation to transform learning environments into new digitally-rich learning environments should be maintained in ICT advanced countries. A new approach for constructing the above-described co-evolution in a systematic way was thus explored. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Blended learning; Digitally-rich learning environments; Education productivity paradox; Pedagogical love; Trust in teachers; Un-captured GDP

Using Longkou, a coastal mining city, as an example, a geological and ecological environmental quality assessment was conducted based on spatiotemporal big data. Remote sensing images, a digital elevation model (DEM), and precipitation and interpolation processing were used to generate factor layers. A synthetic evaluation index system was set up, including physical geography, geological conditions, mining intensity, ecological environmental recovery and geological hazards associated with mining. Moreover, an analytical hierarchy process was used to calculate the factor weight of each evaluation factor, and a consistency check was performed to build an assessment model of the geo-ecological environment of Longkou. The results indicate that multi-factor spatiotemporal big data provide a scientific assessment of the geo-ecological environmental quality with indispensable data and methods. The spatial distribution of geo-ecological environmental quality presented clear specialization of zonality, showing poor quality in the coastal coal mine ore concentration area and good quality in the inland and mountainous areas of Nanshan Mountain. The geo-ecological environmental quality of Longkou was divided into 5 levels as worst, poor, middle, good and better districts. The good and better districts accounted for 76.763% of the total area of the assessment region, indicating that the geo-ecological environmental quality of the study area was in good condition. The mining intensity and ecological environment recovery were major factors in determining the regional variation of the geo-ecological environment of Longkou. The possible causes inducing uncertainties and limitations in evaluation of the geo-ecological environmental quality were discussed. The model combining AHP with GIS proposed in this paper is an effective means of evaluating regional geo-ecological environmental quality. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Analytic hierarchy process; Coal mine concentration area; Geo-ecological environmental assessment; Remote sensing

"Gopi A.G., Rao B.",Products and services in new economic forms,2017,"Prior research in marketing and strategy has noted that products and services have begun to increasingly resemble each other. While it is undeniable that they have always possessed a certain degree of both tangible and intangible characteristics, we see today acceleration in the rate at which products and services are converging. This is especially noticeable in new economic forms such as the access economy and on-demand services. In this paper, we argue that these changes are due to the fact that the exchange of both products and services now occurs primarily on digital platforms. Since the design of these systems stem from the same social, cultural, and technological milieu, the practice enacted by the actors perpetuates similar inherited structure. Using a practice-based lens, we show how products have dematerialized due to an abstraction of ownership and increased value of intangible benefits. We also portray how, on the other hand, the materiality of on-demand services has become more prominent due to the homogenization of experience and tangibility of value. We argue that our conclusions only represent the surface of the complex web of mechanisms underlying contemporary economic activity. We conclude by providing directions for future work, especially in empirical investigations. © 2016 Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology, Inc.",

Yet these intangible assets lead a double life as both spatial and temporal in some dimensions, yet fluid and spatio-temporally elusive in others. Using a framework focused on measuring (by accountants), managing (by corporations) and monitoring (by International Political Economy scholars and regulators), this article explores the longer term implications of accumulation of internationalised capital in intangible and abstract forms, and the prominent role of finance and offshore in giving mobility and fluidity to these forms of capital. The article suggests that while global value chain and global production network analyses have helped researchers and policy-makers to track increasingly fragmented and fluid networks of commodity production, there also is a need to follow the global double life of internationalised and financialised intangible assets and wealth flows, and parallel reorganisations of state forms in response to those transformations. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",finance; Global Wealth Chains; intangible assets; knowledge economy; offshore; taxation
"Quattrociocchi B., Calabrese M., Hysa X., Wankowicz E.",Technology and Innovation for Networks,2017,"The aim of this paper is to retrace the main stages and impact of the digital era, to understand the real benefits of the introduction of new technologies and to ascertain how the new technologies have influenced the organizational and cultural transformations in terms of competitive advantage and collaboration. In this context, to understand better the actor-to-actor connections, interactions and relationship networks, this study relies on a systems thinking perspective by defining the openness degree of the systems and the governance of the communication flows that derive as a consequence. The methodological approach adopted, albeit of a heuristic type, refers to the positive method in that, starting from the analysis of the historical descriptive literature and non-fiction, it intends to formulate very precise future scenarios. The systemic interpretation, in the light of the constructivist paradigm, allows us to subvert the traditional explanatory report ‘object–information–observer’, placing the observation function at the base of the explanatory chain: ‘observer–information–object’. The prospect's change is relevant because every phenomenon in the eyes of the observer is a construct. The present work sheds light on the birth of a new production mode based on collaborative and decentralized models, referred to as ‘weapons of mass collaboration’. Based on these changes, enterprise 2.0 develops. The user–consumer takes on a new look and acquires an active, fluid and growing power. This reveals that innovation can come, and indeed does come, from below, from the same skilled users who increasingly thin the line between professionals and amateurs. Regarding some practical implications, this study shows organizations of any type the benefits of the new economic paradigm, leveraging the partnership to cut costs and accelerating the pace of innovation. Another influential implication to macro- and micro-organizational structures is the transition from an economy of scale to one of flexibility and breadth. Finally, it is noted that the operating economic unit is no longer the company but the economic project around the network between businesses and segments of companies and their subcontractors. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",access; digital divide; enterprise 2.0; mass collaboration; network; starfish organization

According to the 'Strategy for the Development of the Information Society in the Russian Federation for 2017-2030', in 2016 there are more than 80 million people in the Russian segment of the Internet network, and the total amount of sales of goods (services) through the Internet in 2015 is equivalent to 2.3% of Russia's GDP. The digital economy is defined as an activity where the main factor of production 'is data in digital form where processing of that data in large volumes and the use of its analysis results, in comparison with traditional forms of management, significantly increase the efficiency of various types of production, technologies, equipment, storage, sale, delivery of goods and services'. Therefore, currently, new approaches are required for the training of digital economy personnel, as well as new models and calculation technologies that allow one to instantly and accurately determine the value of innovative products.

This new methodology complements traditional methodologies of shadow economy estimation with such a component as digital shadow economy. Our analysis of the most popular today methods of shadow economic estimation proves that, despite some of its drawbacks, the MIMIC model can be treated as the most comprehensive and appropriate method for such calculations since it takes into account both causal and indicators of shadow economy. As the causal variables here, as applied to digital shadow economy, we use household access to the Internet and IT overall, the volume of non-cash payments and the use of most advanced fi nancial instruments. While as the indicators of the digital shadow economy spread we use: the volume of non-cash payments at online platforms, the frequency of cryptocurrency payments, and the cost of parcels to which customs duties have not been applied. For further empirical verifi cation of the model proposed here, numerical values of both causal variables and indicators would be necessary. Unfortunately, offi cial statistical sources are unable to provide such data in full volume, especially when it comes to cryptocurrencies and other informal payments. Thus, in our further research we plan to not only prove the practical applicability of the offered here model for estimations of digital shadow economy size as well as overall size of shadow economy on the examples of particular countries, but also to accumulate the necessary statistics for such calculations. © 2017, Technical University of Liberec.

The focus is on both subjective and objective measures related to the level of consumer awareness and action in a fast-growing competition, potentiated by the digital economy. In order to investigate the relations between the aforementioned concepts, a questionnaire-based survey was conducted, using a sample of 257 students from three top Romanian universities. Based upon the theoretical directions presented in the literature review, a conceptual model was elaborated and tested by employing a partial least squares structural equation modeling technique. As the examination of the structural model indicated, online purchasing decision-making is indirectly influenced by the high competition in the digital economy, by means of consumer protection awareness and consumer protection behavior. At this level, the analyzed factors, namely the competition in the digital economy, the consumer protection awareness and the consumer behavior with respect to the consumer protection policies, explain over 16% in the variance of the online purchasing decision-making.",Competition; Consumer protection; Digital economy; Online purchasing decision-making
Lacey S.,The TPP and the Digital Economy the Agreement’s Potential as a Benchmark for Future Rule-Making,2017,"The way things are quickly changing in the internet economy is important from the standpoint of regulation (and thus government actors and policymakers), since legislative and regulatory frameworks that are too restrictive may tend to inhibit the emergence of new business models or may impede the adoption of innovative products and solutions that have the potential to disrupt established business models and those interests that are behind them. This is in fact the very problem we continue to encounter today and that confront a range of recent innovations, but is particularly visible in the battles being waged over different platforms and services that have emerged in the so-called “sharing economy” [For more on the sharing economy see Telles (2016)]. This chapter examines some of the negotiating outcomes achieved in the Trans-Pacific Partnership and other negotiating fora on rules for the digital economy. This chapter also discusses whether or not the tentative negotiating outcomes achieved in the TPP can be considered the starting point for an emerging international consensus on these rules. Although now very probably defunct as an economic integration project, the TPP still constitutes a helpful starting point given that it nevertheless constitutes an agreed body of rules concluded between a very diverse set of developing and advanced economies with a distinctly divergent set of objectives and approaches when it comes to regulating certain aspects of the internet economy. © 2017, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Digital economy; E-commerce; Information and communications technology ICT; Regional Comprehensive Investment Partnership; Trade in Services Agreement; Trade rules for the digital economy; Trans Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership; Trans-Pacific Partnership

The reason of speedy digital logistics progress basing on the functioning machinery, and a great attention to this transformation have merely economic reasons of driving down of logistic element costs which is present in every product or commodity and, along with the logistics, has influence on basically all economy sectors. For example, there is the Permanent Digital Transport and Logistics Forum in the European Union. In our opinion, the existing trans-formation models are extremely useful in connection with Russia’s and EEU member countries’ decision on the digital transformation of economy. Highly-developed and contemporary transport and logistical systems are now the key factors in economic competitiveness of the country. Roads, railroads, inland waterway system, seaports and airports facilitate union of different regions of the country, population and employment centers and international exchange. Maintenance and improvement of effective and striking transport and logistics infrastructures for people and freight traffic keep being the pivotal points of the modern national and global markets. This becomes particularly important in the light of predicted growth of population and inevitable fundamental changes in industry, energetics (especially in oil and gas sectors) and farming industry. Movement of goods and manufacturing component between goods manufacturers, growth of urban logistics, international supply chains and logistics are already an interface between such phenomena as digital economy and new industries. It is necessary to say that logistics amounts to from 10% to 20% in every final product. Logistics costs vary greatly and may amount to a negligible component for merely digital products, transmitted via Internet, or, for example, total up to 60% for oil.

"Pînzaru F., Anghel L., Mihalcea A.",Sustainable management in the new economy: Are Romanian companies ready for the digital challenge?,2017,"In the context of the new economy, organizations are forced to learn and to reinvent themselves in order to become more competitive. Don Tapscott (2015, p.17) states that the new economy is characterized by the use of exclusively digital information and it represents ""a knowledge economy based on the application of human know-how to everything we produce and how we produce it”. Thus, new economy means the digitalization of companies on a structural level: human resources management, R&D, marketing, IT security, e-management and e-business integrative models. This implies a new shift in the organizational design, rethinking of operational processes, m-marketing strategies, digital competencies, analytical and mobile technologies. Florina Pînzaru (2016, p.27) indicates that „we must acknowledge that we are now at the crossroads and that managers should think of the mutations that we start to face as the world rushes to become digitally interconnected”. Our research is based upon the following fundamental question: the Romanian business environment is ready for this type of digital maturity and what are the main challenges that it faces at this point? In order to answer these questions, we used a double approach: on the one hand, we used content analysis based upon the articles from Romanian business newspapers (Capital, Financial Magazine, BIZ Magazine); on the other hand, a qualitative approach, through the interviews with various managers in order to see if the Romanian business environment is ready for this type of digital maturity and what are the main challenges that is facing at this point. Despite this positive trends, we noticed major disruption between industries concerning investments in IT & research and development. When it comes to embracing new business models focused on driving innovation through sharing knowledge and information, multinationals from Romania follow the global strategy, whereas Romanian companies lack collaboration with local hubs or platforms for developing new ideas and products.

This article examines within the context of the experience economy how these digital images aim to evoke and manipulate specific place atmospheres to emphasise the experiential qualities of new buildings and urban environments. In particular, we argue that computer-generated images are far from 'just' glossy representations but are a new form of visualising the urban that captures and markets particular embodied sensations. Drawing on a 2-year qualitative study of architects' practices that worked on the Msheireb project, a large-scale redevelopment project in Doha (Qatar), we examine how digital visualisation technology enables the virtual engineering of sensory experiences using a wide range of graphic effects. We show how these computer-generated images are laboriously materialised in order to depict and present specific sensory, embodied regimes and affective experiences to appeal to clients and consumers. Such development has two key implications. First, we demonstrate the importance of digital technologies in framing the 'expressive infrastructure' of the experience economy. Second, we argue that although the Msheireb computer-generated images open up a field of negotiation between producers and the Qatari client, and work quite hard at being culturally specific, they ultimately draw 'on a Westnocentric literary and sensory palette' that highlights the continuing influence of colonial sensibilities in supposedly postcolonial urban processes. © The Author(s) 2015.",Architecture; Atmosphere; Computer-generated image; Digital visualisation; Doha; Experience economy; Qatar; Senses

Farmer K.,"Robots, human capital, welfare and unemployment in a digital world economy",2017,"Intelligent machines (robots) might have vastly destructive consequences for future human welfare and employment. Following Frey and Osborn (2013), popular media predict that during the next 10 to 20 years 50% and more of contemporary human jobs will be replaced by robots. Thus, it is natural to ask the question whether investments in human capital can ameliorate the threatening loss of jobs involving even middle- and high-skilled tasks. Policy advisors mainly recommend public expenditures in order to foster digital competences among population. However, there might also be an avenue for more traditional human capital investments by individuals and governments. Capital investments in a broader range of human activities than only digital competences might namely ameliorate the rivalry between traditional and digital production in Sachs et al.'s (2015) overlapping generations (OLG) model. The model focuses on an economy in which final goods are produced by machines without human labor (robots) and by human labor and traditional capital. One key finding is ""that an increase in robotic productivity will temporarily raise output, but, by lowering the demand for labor, can lower wages and consumption in the long run. In what we term a paradox of robotic productivity (italics in original), innovations that increase the productivity of robotic investment can, after a generation, lower robotic and total output, and lower the well-being (lifetime utility) of all future generations."" (Sachs et al. 2015, p. 1) Young households in the OLG economy of Sachs et al. (2015) invest their savings either in robots or traditional capital but nobody invests in human capital. Thus, it remains as the first open question whether Sachs' et al. (2015) negative long run welfare consequences of digitalization also arise when the government as an agent of young households invests in human capital with the aim to counteract the decrease in labor productivity resulting from the substitution of robots for traditional capital. Second. Sachs et al. (2015) assume full employment while many fear unemployment as a consequence of more productive robots. Thus, the second question is whether robots raise or diminish existing unemployment. The proposed chapter answers both questions by extending the OLG model of Sachs et al. (2015) through human capital accumulation in line with Glomm and Ravikumar (1992) and involuntary unemployment in accordance with Magnani (2015). It will be shown which basic model parameters are conducive for beneficial or immiserizing technological change and whether more productive robots will raise or decrease involuntary unemployment. © 2018 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",Digital OLG model; Human capital; Involuntary unemployment; Robots; Welfare

The research methodology is based on the -new institutional theory. Contrary to the common perception that the market and major companies give way to network interaction forms, we maintain that methods of organization of business interaction are growing in variety, particularly in terms of enlargement of federated structures based on possessory control. Our analysis of the available models of business activity organization showed that attenuated information asymmetry makes the management of large corporations apply tougher methods to control their divisions. The present article highlights three types of principal-agent problems in intercorporate relations: blatant opportunism, mild opportunism and inefficient performance. We point out that lifting information access barriers will counteract predominantly the first two of the above-mentioned types, resulting from the fact that low performance is based not only on information asymmetry, but also on the weakening of incentives, which is typical of collective forms of business activity organization. We argue that centralization, bureaucratization and total control inherent in tough management methods undermine even more the motivation of employees and, consequently, exacerbate the issue of missed opportunities. © 2017. revistaESPACIOS.com.",Corporate control; Corporations; Digital economy; Disruptive selection; Incentives; Information and communication technologies; Information asymmetry; Opportunistic behavior

"Karapetyants I., Kostuhin Y., Tolstykh T., Shkarupeta E., Krasnikova A.",Establishment of research competencies in The context of Russian digitalization,2017,"The configuration of global markets undergoes substantial changes as affected by digitization. Many traditional industries become less significant in the global economy structure alongside the rapid growth of new sectors, generating fundamentally new needs. The determinant role in the ongoing transformation is acquired by research and invention, which requires creation of system of research and invention management in digital economy field enabling coordination of efforts of interested parties - representatives of the Federal Agencies of Executive Authority, companies, higher educational establishments and scientific organizations. Intensive development of digital economy society inevitably involves tasks in knowledge management field. The priority sources are information and knowledge acquired from the knowledge-based experience. And, competencies, being a competitive position on the market, are innovativeness, expert knowledge, creativeness, cognition. Therefore, transition from physical to digital economy requires fundamentally new approaches not only in industries and factories, but also in formation of human resources for digital economy: education, staff training, establishment and innovative human capital management. In the paper we considered approaches, tools and mechanisms of formation of key conditions for digital economy staff training and perfection of the educational system which must provide digital economy with the competitive work force. The crucial point of the approach must be formation of the support system of exploratory and applied research in digital economy (research infrastructure of digital platforms), providing technological independence of every direction of transparent digital technologies which are competitive on a global basis. © 2017 International Business Information Management Association IBIMA.

We are currently at the point where a small number of global corporations dominate most of the daily activity on the network. The affordances of digital technology and the unique characteristics of these corporations pose unprecedented challenges for antitrust and other regulatory concepts that were shaped in a pre-digital age. If society is to be able to control and regulate these corporations then new conceptualisations of corporate power and regulation are required.",

Methods. A combination of the historical, evolutionary, and institutional methods of research has been used. Conclusion and significance. The transformation of the paradigm of economic development is characterized by changes in the nature of labor division, the dominant way of interaction among business entities, and the basis of economic power. Changes in the nature of labor division imply intellectual and organizational centers getting separated from production and service departments. Changes in the dominant way of interaction among business entities imply the gradual displacement of the free market as the leading way of interfirm interaction by value networks. Property ownership, in a classical sense, is ceasing to be the main foundation of economic power, its place being increasingly taken over by a status in the hierarchy of the field of interaction that enables one to establish the rules for interaction and distribute added value.",Digital economy; Digital revolution; Economic power; Labor division; Paradigm of economic development
"Matar L., Aoun G.",The challenges and opportunities of the sharing economy: The case of a developing economy,2017,"Globalization, new technology and the standardization of the way of thinking in developed, emerging and developing countries give the sharing economy a huge opportunity all over the world. The economy of sharing is spreading in all domains and activities. Many economic sectors are facing challenges and competition from a new business model and new ideas based on digital platforms and spreading rapidly across all societies. The volume of this economy is increasing yearly and the defenders of the sharing praise the benefits of this phenomenon. The debate is open about the reality and the consequences of an economy evaluated to several billions of dollars and will be able to disrupt the life of millions of persons globally. In our paper, we analyze the sharing today and tomorrow, the benefits and the challenges of this economy. We explore the human implications, the assumption of sharing on the job market and on the nature of work today and in the near future. Our methodology is based on a literature review of the subject and on an analysis, using three conceptual models considered the most appropriate regarding the sharing economy: The Diffusion of Innovation Theory (DOI, Rogers), the Creative destruction (Schumpeter) and the Social exchange theory (Homans and Blau). We conduct a survey on university students in order to identify, analyze and study their motivations concerning the sharing. © 2017 International Business Information Management Association, IBIMA.

While the global sourcing of activities in the development of digital assets is widespread, very little is known about how location-related factors may affect confidentiality outcomes. Addressing this, we empirically investigate two factors with rich theoretical bases and logical linkages to confidentiality: industrial agglomeration and national property rights protections. We conduct a large-scale, empirical study at the product level of analysis, and treat the confidentiality of a digital product as a performance outcome that is affected by the locations of the two key organizational entities involved in the product's development. We leverage modern, web-crawling methods to harvest secondary data from a major, illicit distribution channel for these products and combine these data with other secondary data involving legitimate commerce to derive a secondary measure of confidentiality performance. We find robust results, and demonstrate practical significance of our findings through scenario analyses based on actual data from our sample. © 2016 Production and Operations Management Society",clusters; digital economy; global sourcing; intellectual property; new product development; video game industry

"Plaksin S., Abdrakhmanova G., Kovaleva G.",Approaches to defining and measuring Russia's internet economy,2017,"The rapid development of digital technologies is changing production processes and forms of interaction. It has encouraged growing interest in electronic content and created a new segment of the economy where all actors rely on the internet. These processes are most noticeable in developed countries. Russia is no exception. The development of the domestic segment of the internet economy - the economy of the Runet - is of particular importance due to the size of the country, the significant socioeconomic heterogeneity and the underdevelopment of the transportation networks in the Russian regions. A study of the phenomenon of the internet economy requires a reliable information base. It is hard to provide an adequate quantitative estimate of the size of the internet economy for the following reasons. First, the existing statistical indicator system was created before the internet and internet businesses were widespread. Secondly, this new segment of economy is much more heterogeneous than traditional sectors and industries and thus difficult to measure. This paper summarises the results of a review of international and Russian approaches on how to measure the internet economy. It also introduces a new way to measure the size of Russia's internet economy that is based on the principles of the System of National Accounts (SNA), using officially available statistical data, thus making this approach different from the previous recommendations. This new approach ensures a stable reproducibility of calculations, reliability and comparability of results as well as compliance with the standards of government statistics. The evaluation of the dynamics of economic processes that drive the internet economy was not in the scope of the study. This requires a separate study, including an analysis of how indices of constant quality that neutralize the effect of changes in consumer product properties and deflators are created The authors stipulate that these research areas hold independent interest.",Internet; Internet economy; Online and offline business; System of National Accounts (SNA)

But how do you measure the value of something that consists of little more than bits of information, brand awareness and a compelling idea?In the winner takes all digital world how do you know if this idea is one that will attract billions of dedicated users or a few thousand fleeting trialists?And, most importantly, how do you assess whether any given business model is robust enough to make billions or flawed in a way that will lose millions?Lopez Lubian and Esteves look at what economic value means in a digital world, and argue for a shift from traditional value metrics to digital value metrics. Through high profile case studies they examine the process of valuation in the digital world - examining the challenges of making objective judgments from subjective information and how to assess the value of data. Next they analyse in depth a number of different digital business models from the perspective of delivering value to investors, stakeholders and society at large.

Park N.,Data Protection in the TPP: More Emphasis on the “Use” Than the “Protection”,2017,"It is very significant for the TPP, being a free trade agreement, to have explicit provisions on data protection, if it is ultimately effective. The TPP recognizes the importance of personal data in the digital economy. However, it is a pity that the TPP has provisions on data protection which do not aim at a higher standard among the Parties, as the use of personal data is significantly emphasized over the protection of personal data. It is further disappointing for the TPP to make substantial obligations less obligatory by using the words like ‘should’ and ‘shall endeavor to’. Although the TPP’s fate is still uncertain as a result of President Trump’s decision of withdrawal, its provisions on data protection seem to revive in any future trade agreement which aims to legalize a free trade in data including personal data. In conclusion, it may be understandable that the degree of data protection is not at the same level with the degree of force accorded to the use of personal data in the TPP, as it is not a data protection or privacy agreement per se. Nevertheless, in order to create and further develop the digital economy, data protection should be on the same level as the use or trade in data including personal data. © 2017, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",APEC; Data protection; Digital trade; Personal data; TPP; Trade in data
"Vendrell-Herrero F., Myrthianos V., Parry G., Bustinza O.F.",Digital dark matter within product service systems,2017,"Purpose: The unobserved benefits of digital technologies are described as digital dark matter. Product service systems (PSSs) are bundles of products and services that deliver value in use, which is unobserved but generates benefits. This paper aims to empirically quantify digital dark matter within PSSs and correlates that measure with national competitiveness. Design/methodology/approach: A novel methodology establishes the link between customer needs and a product and digital service portfolio offered across ten developed economies. The case context is the music industry where product and services are often substitutes – a cannibalistic PSS. Consumer information is obtained from a unique database of more than 18,000 consumer surveys. Consumer demand for digital formats is modelled and predicted through logistic regressions. Findings: The work provides inverse estimations for digital dark matter within PSSs by calculating the gap between supply and demand for digital offers – described as the business model challenge. The USA has the lowest business model challenge; the home of major companies developing digital technologies. Digital dark matter is shown to be positively correlated with national competitiveness and manufacturing competitiveness indices. Practical implications: The success of a cannibalistic PSS requires good understanding of market demand. Governments embarking on soft innovation policies might incentivise the development of service-orientated business models based on digital technologies. Originality/value: Work expands theory on the concept of digital dark matter to the PSS literature.

The digital transformation of firms requires leadership that can promote the adaptive quality of organizational culture. Design/methodology/approach - The authors conducted an empirical study using two key informants from a sample of 181 incumbent firms. Findings - The authors find significant evidence that adaptive culture is the vehicle by which transformational leaders positively influence e-business adoption. Originality/value - Given the digital economy's external pressures, many e-business adoption processes fail due to organizational factors originating in leadership and its capability to change followers' values, norms, and motivations.

Transforming Organizations for the Subscription Economy: Starting from Scratch aims to prepare executives for a world in which everythingis social, augmented and autonomous; objects and spaces will havemultiple purposes, capabilities and meanings. This is a new territoryfull of opportunity which is generally discussed only at the level oftechnology involved instead of the intellectual level, where the realunderstanding of the need for transformation resides. The book revealsideas about what is possible if we transform the present. The narrativeis organized around what is actual and what is potential; what is theprobable future that we can arrive at through change, and what is thepossible future that we can build through transformation. When engagingin transformation, the following strategic question develops: ifyou were designing your organization today, how would you design it?In other words, how would you go about it starting from scratch? This book provides the intellectual framework that empowers organizations to understand and navigate the emerging present, and to develop and deliver products and services of intrinsic value to users. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Alexander Manu; individual chapters, the contributors.",
Pyka A.,Dedicated innovation systems to support the transformation towards sustainability: Creating income opportunities and employment in the knowledge-based digital bioeconomy,2017,"In order to counter something to the most thrilling challenges of mankind at the beginning of the twenty-first century, production and consumption systems need to transform towards sustainability. We argue that the knowledge-based bioeconomy and digitalization are two promising technological approaches which require to be thought together in order to contribute to the transformation and to trigger the required technological dynamics. However, such a broad transformative process requires a participation of all societal stakeholders. Innovation systems in principle offer a framework for policy designs supporting the transformation, but they need to be extended to include the direction towards overcoming the lock-in in oil-based economic activities and mass consumption. For this purpose, we introduce the idea of a Dedicated Innovation System, which takes care of potential inertia due to the interest of established (oil-based) industries and consider the economic opportunities raised by social and responsible innovation. The transformation process will likely compensate for decreasing jobs in traditional sectors, which are increasingly replaced by robotics and artificial intelligence. The knowledge-based digital bioeconomy is likely to generate the emergence of new sectors with new employment opportunities, e.g. in periphery regions or in the emerging sharing-economy sector. © The Author(s). 2017.",Bioeconomy; Dedicated innovation systems; Digitalization; Innovation; Transformation

Mishra N.,The role of the trans-pacific partnership agreement in the internet ecosystem: Uneasy liaison or synergistic alliance?,2017,"The Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP) is the first trade agreement that comprehensively deals with contemporary policy issues in digital trade. It introduces new disciplines on issues such as cross-border data flows, online privacy, network neutrality, cybersecurity, regulation of spam, and safe harbour protection for internet intermediaries. These provisions are atypical of trade agreements, and are particularly significant as they have a direct impact on internet policy. In this article, I evaluate these new disciplines in the TPP to assess the extent to which the TPP is suitably placed in the internet eco-system. After a comprehensive legal assessment of these disciplines, I argue that the TPP does not effectively fit into the broader internet ecosystem, as it fails to synergize the goal of trade liberalization with important internet policy concerns such as facilitating trust of internet users and digital innovation. However, despite its deficiencies, the TPP sets a new benchmark for rules on digital trade, as its provisions address several contemporary issues in the digital economy. Therefore, the provisions on digital trade within the TPP will be instrumental in future negotiations at the World Trade Organization (WTO) and other regional bodies. More importantly, the TPP is a reminder of the increasing significance of trade agreements in influencing critical aspects of internet policy. Particularly, in developing rules on digital trade that affect issues such as cross-border data flows, online privacy and consumer protection, net neutrality and cybersecurity, trade negotiators/lawyers need to comprehensively assess the relevance of these rules in the liberalization of digital trade, and its broader impact on the internet ecosystem. © The Author 2017.

One such challenge concerns data quality in various enterprise systems, within both enterprises and entire value networks. Since data will continue to be the foundation of the digital economy, a certain level of data quality is necessary to ensure eﬃcient business processes. Therefore, adequate master data quality management is essential at both the corporate and inter-organizational levels. In response, in light of a systematic literature review and interview study with several business experts experienced in and responsible for master data management in their companies, we not only underscore the need for research on inter-organizational master data quality, but also ultimately derive initial functional requirements for tools that can support inter-organizational information sharing in a value network. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Data quality; Information sharing; Inter-Organizational business process; Master data; Supply chain; Value network

"Sarti S., Corsini F., Gusmerotti N.M., Frey M.",Food sharing: Making sense between new business models and responsible social initiatives for food waste prevention,2017,"In the context of circular economy, food waste represents an important challenge. Recently some initiatives emerged in fighting and preventing food waste using digital technologies. Food sharing platforms allow individuals and businesses (e.g. retailers, producers, local shops) to share surplus food to other platform users. Our study aims at exploring which models are adopted in food sharing practices based on market orientation (for-profit or non-profit) and market structure (peer-to-peer or business-to-peer), and their contribution to the food waste prevention. Using content analysis, our results indicate there are two typologies of social initiatives and two prevailing business models: social sharing platforms, corporate social sharing platforms, social eating platforms (SE business model) and food alerting platform (FAP business model). Despite the positive social and environmental impact, these initiatives have to face some criticisms due to the lack of a dominant player and the high fragmentation of users among the existing platforms. © FrancoAngeli.",Circular economy; Food sharing platform; Food waste; Innovative business model; Social initiative
"Rhéaume L., Gardoni M.",Infocom business models innovation with the development of corporate universities,2017,"Since the mid-90s, the infocom industry has gone into a period of sustained disruptive innovations which, combined with deregulation, led to a lot of turbulence and a sometimes difficult redefinition of business models. A Schumpeterian wave of innovation enhanced by competition leads to creation of wealth as an unprecedented investment boom occurs in the infocom sector sustained by overly optimistic and sometimes fraudulent forecasts of internet traffic. We provide a strategic framework by explaining which types of infocom business models are better adapted to cope with the challenges of the new developments related to the digital economy, in order to shape the corporate innovation strategy. We also analyse how the development of a corporate university must be linked to the development of such innovation strategy. The first section of the article deals with the wave of disruptive innovations in the communications industry over the last few years and pinpoints the ubiquity of IT in all aspects of the economy and society. The next section focuses on the search for profitable business models for infocom providers. The links between business model innovation and the development of corporate universities is analysed in the next section. It is followed by a discussion section.

Díaz P.S.,EU competition law needs to install a plug-in,2017,"This article vindicates the definition of a new approach to Article 102 enforcement in digital economy based on the concept of multi-sided platform, which in turn revolves around the data flow among groups of users on the various sides of the platform in the form of indirect network effects. The cross-cutting nature of such novel approach, embedded into a broader paradigm of contestable markets and dynamic competition, calls for an analytical framework for market definition and market power appraisal to be devised accordingly. Once such framework is sketched, a section is devoted to exploring recent abuse cases involving e-platforms in light of the approach advocated by this article. In order to provide a full overview, other legal questions are explored as well, with a focus on the relaxation of the notion of ex ante objective justification and the place for an ex post efficiency defence within the proposed analytical framework. © 2017 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands.",
"Palmer C., Urwin E.N., Young R.I.M., Marilungo E.",A reference ontology approach to support global product-service production,2017,"The need to innovate and compete drives organisations to constantly seek new approaches to facilitate business and commerce. As market places become ever more globalised and digital economies grow, these organisations rely more heavily upon systems to design and deliver their products and services. Hence, when developing and operating a global production network the need for systems to interoperate between different domains and contexts within a global production network becomes paramount if organisations are to succeed. This paper puts forwards a reference ontology that has been developed to enable the interoperation of software tools involved in the global production of new product-services systems (PSS). It sets out the levels of the reference ontology, detailing closely the product-service aspects. This has been developed using a formal logic-based approach. An example knowledge base has been created from industrial end user information with queries applied to this to provide a set of results, showing the ability of the reference ontology.

In fact, in the U.S.A., this class of workers has doubled in one generation, from 22% in 1960 to 43% in 2006 (Rainie and Wellman 2012). This global phenomenon issues from an economic evolution where actors engage with commercial commodities on an abstract rather than concrete plane (Erickson et al. 2014); researchers often call these changes information revolution, as economic and social transformation has partially been fueled by the rise of new ICTs (Castells 2006; Webster 2006). Moreover, the effects of the Great Recession and the expansion of the global economy have engendered modular and project-focused knowledge-work models (Barley and Kunda 2006; Schultze and Boland 2000).

More than offering services, development related policies have tried to widen the scope of their actions, bringing together the necessary aspects for an accurate alignment between the implementation of public services and the needs of the population. The focus of this article is to present a model of e-government system development which analyses the system integrity of organization management, operation application, information resources and technology by the use of analytic and synthetic methods, dynamical modelling and solving the system of delay differential equations. The characteristics of Czech Republic are used as an illustrative example based on The Digital Economy and Society Index. It can be expected that the procedure for solving the dynamic model, described in the article, that uses contemporary mathematic methods of so-called “Differential Equations Theory” with delayed argument, can be successfully used for both modelling further concrete economic relations and for economic models in general and in various conditions. © 2017 International Business Information Management Association IBIMA.

"Craffert L., Visser K., Claassen W., Van Audenhove L.",Crossing conceptual barriers: A methodological approach in a language-Challenged SMME environment,2017,"Internationally there is general consensus about the acknowledgement of entrepreneurs as engines of growth and development, even more so in developing countries. Entrepreneurs inspire a culture of entrepreneurial development and innovation and they create businesses by contributing significantly to employment, gross domestic product (GDP) and developing the economy. Globally the need for more support to develop entrepreneurs is accepted. The body of research demonstrates that “whether in emerging or developed markets, SMEs that have embraced advanced, data-driven mobile capabilities have fared better than their peers” and that progress is achieved only when the focus is on meaningful use for a specific purpose and in a specific community or business setting. However, for the majority of South African micro-entrepreneurs, such technology is available only on their mobile devices. This paper describes an intervention process with micro-enterprise entrepreneurs who participated in a research programme aimed at 1) understanding the current usage of technology in support of productivity and business growth, 2) the challenges they experienced in this regard, and 3) the identification of potential interventions to support them in utilising the affordances of mobile technology. The project focussed on three areas in an integrated manner, namely business skills, digital skills (mobile technology) and personal skills (in a secondary context). In terms of business and digital comprehension and terminology, a significant conceptual gap arose between the research team and participants; consequently, the Cognitive Engagement Board (CEB) in the form of a physical representation of the business value chain and applicable digital technologies was specifically developed to bridge the conceptual barriers amongst participants. The tool assesses entrepreneurs’ current business practices and skills to develop a systemic approach to enhance mobile technology usage and to improve their business operations. The project focussed on three areas in an integrated manner, namely business skills, digital skills (mobile technology) and personal skills (in a secondary context). In facilitating the contextual understanding by micro-entrepreneurs the CEB application proved to be beneficial and practical, which is essential for the development of business and digital skills, and for the selection of relevant digital tools (applications) for business improvement and growth. It furthermore contributes towards peer learning and the opening up of new opportunities beyond the local market. © 2017 Academic Conferences Limited.

"Khan I.U., Hameed Z., Khan S.U.",Understanding online banking adoption in a developing country: UTAUT2 with cultural moderators,2017,"The massive growth in digital devices and communication has spotlighted the wisdom of doing financial transactions through online banking. In developing Asian economies, online banking technology can strengthen financial systems by developing a solid connection between financial institutions and the local populace. Technology acceptance studies are under-researched in this region, especially with innovative models. Filling the gap, this paper uses a comprehensive model of extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2), moderated by cultural variables. This will provide new insights into the determinants of technology acceptance by considering cultural effects on individual customers. The authors analyzed the model through structural equation modeling. The results validated performance expectancy, facilitating conditions, habit, perceived security, and price value as important antecedents of behavioral intentions. The cultural dimensions, collectivism, and uncertainty avoidance were found to be significant moderators in explaining behavioral intention and usage behavior for online banking.

Alexander B.,Disruption of the retail ecosystem: The South African e-Retail imperative,2017,"This study provides a broad overview of e-Retail implementation within the South African retail sector. The readiness of the South African retail sector for e-Retail is interrogated on the basis of a selection of technology, marketing, operations and business imperatives. The study sought to elucidate viability and sustainability of e-Retail in South Africa by focussing on already active role-players. The study elucidates the competitiveness of the South African e-Retail sector within a disruptive global environment. A praxis model is proposed for enhancing service delivery with due cognisance of the socio-techno-economic divide that characterises the South African society. The model provides a comprehensive and systematic framework for specifically evaluating the potential impact of disruptive social, business and technology trends. The establishment of a change agenda for e-Retail within the South African landscape is the central theme of this research. The study therefore has two specific focus areas, namely, e-Retail Readiness and e-Retail Change Agenda. The former aspect was methodologically supported by conducting an online survey; and the latter was supported by conducting scoping and focus groups. The online survey clearly indicated specific aspects of e-Retail engagement that demanded redress. The focus groups addressed a wide range of substantive matters relating to the viability of e-Retail within the South African developing economy. The data from the focus groups were then synthesised into a process model to drive the change agenda for e-Retail in South Africa. The study makes significant knowledge contributions with respect to the delineation of salient issues to be addressed with regard to the practical implementation of e-Retail in South Africa. The praxis model for e-Retail implementation provides a platform for exploring opportunities and challenges within a complex environment of change and transformation. Copyright The Authors, 2017.

Chaudhry P.E.,The looming shadow of illicit trade on the internet,2017,"Pirates on the virtual sea are supplying their illicit digital content and goods through cyberlockers and darknet markets. The deep web hosts darknet marketplaces selling a variety of wares, such as narcotics and weapons, and is testimony to the growth of illicit trade on the internet. The challenge of web sites that host digital content piracy is exacerbated through linkages to a variety of malware schemes that have created a lucrative crimeware economy. Digital thieves target unsuspecting consumers as digital bait to derive profits from a variety of malware schemes such as ransomware and malvertising. The hijacking of access to computers and their digital content in order to ransom them back to consumers or organizations is considered to be one of the leading threats of internet crime. Malvertising schemes are plaguing the internet advertising business—criminals are reaping profits by posting legitimate advertisements at content theft sites or using an army of botnets to fake advertising traffic. A variety of stratagems are evolving to curb this illicit trade, including fostering multi-lateral enforcement tactics, updating legislation to circumvent this type of crime on the internet, training digital savvy citizens, and creating private-sector remedies. © 2016 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University",Crimeware; Cybercrime prevention; Darknet; Internet piracy; Malvertising; Online black market; Ransomware

"Kourtit K., Nijkamp P.",Urban Facebooks as digital planning and marketing tools in the ‘New urban world’,2017,"The geography of our planet in the 21st century is characterized by a new megatrend of rapid world-wide urbanization. Kourtit (2015) has described this emerging trend as follows:In the ‘century of cities’, our planet is gradually moving towards a ‘New Urban World’: more and more people are moving towards cities or urban agglomerations, so that urban areas have become the ŉew home of humankind’. The ‘New Urban World’ is a recent phenomenon in the rich history of cities. At present, not only does more than 50 per cent of the world’s population live in cities, but also urbanisation is still persistently and rapidly increasing, in particular in the developing world. Consequently, modern cities tend to become magnets of economic, cultural, political and technological power. This phenomenon is often referred to as the ‘New Urban World’ or sometimes also as the ‘post-urban world’ (see Westlund 2014). This ‘New Urban World’ marks a new stage in the urban landscape of our planet that is characterised by a rapid and structural transformation of settlement patterns of people, firms, and activities into urbanised patterns of living and working as the new dominant locational map of our world. (p. 8) In the same vein, she argues:The agglomeration advantages of the ‘New Urban World’ originate from economies of density, proximity, accessibility and connectivity. In other words, urbanized areas are able to generate increasing returns to scale, and, hence, are generating self-propelling growth. Urban agglomerations will most likely also become the socio-economic powerhouses of the future and exhibit a fast dynamics in the decades to come. Cities are certainly not crafted in stone, but are a ‘process’, always ‘on the move’, in order to create favourable conditions for economic agents.

Zou M.,The regulatory challenges of 'Uberization' in China: Classifying ride-hailing drivers,2017,"There has been nascent litigation around the world on the employment classification of workers in the 'sharing economy', 'gig economy' or 'on demand economy'. New business models and forms of work organization arising from rapid advancements in digital technologies (or 'disruptive innovation' as some have described the phenomenon) have sparked considerable debate on a wide array of regulatory issues, including the role of labour law protections for the emergent 'digital workforce'. This debate is currently taking place in the People's Republic of China. This article analyses how Chinese courts and lawmakers have addressed issues that are directly or indirectly relevant to determining the status of drivers in the ride-hailing sector. Despite the presence of criteria for identifying a 'labour relationship' under Chinese labour law, the courts have not adopted a uniform approach across different types of claims involving these drivers. A new government regulation on the ride-hailing sector, which took effect in November 2016, has not resolved this issue as it permits ride-hailing platform companies to enter into labour contracts and other forms of agreements with drivers based on the particularities of their work arrangements. In considering these recent cases and regulatory developments, the article concludes that a purposive approach to the existing criteria in Chinese labour law for ascertaining the status of workers in the sharing economy is useful for addressing the basic question of whether they should be protected, rather than creating 'new' categories of employment classification. © 2017 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands.",

It is proposed that resilience is based on the long-run capacities of urban economies to re-invent themselves in the face of external shocks emanating from such phenomena as globalisation and technological change. This hypothesis is investigated by analysing employment change and the development of knowledge based private sector service industries and digital firms in English and Welsh cities from 1911. On the basis of this analysis, it is concluded that those cities with the highest levels of knowledge based employment in 1911 have emerged as the most resilient economies in terms of their long-term employment growth paths. Conversely, those urban economies with the highest levels of low knowledge intensity jobs in 1911 have tended to replicate those types of employment and consequently have suffered from low levels of resilience in the face of the local impacts of globalisation and technological shocks. © Nick Williams and Tim Vorley 2017., All rights reserved.",
Taneja N.K.,21st Century airlines: Connecting the dots,2017,"In 21st Century Airlines: Connecting the Dots, Nawal Taneja addresses the challenges and opportunities facing the airline industry as it tries to innovate and create products and services that are radically different by ‘connecting the dots’ at four key levels: recognizing the implications of global events, improving cross-functional collaboration within the organization, working more closely with the travel chain, and providing much higher engagements with connectors within the social networks. The book synthesizes insights gained from the experience of non-traditional businesses, such as Uber, that have no physical assets and that focus on scalability through platforms, as well as traditional businesses, such as Mercedes-Benz, that are transitioning from operators of physical assets to adapt to the on-demand and sharing economies. These insights show pragmatically that digitizing airline businesses would require digital mind-sets, digital technologies, digital strategies, and digital workplaces to explore new frontiers in value for both customers and airlines. Moreover, forward-thinking airlines need to consider working with bimodal organizational structures, in which one group optimizes current business models (network, fleet, and schedule planning, as well as revenue management) while a second group explores innovative ways to add digital featuresto physical products to provide a consistent experience throughout the journey. The book is written for all senior-level practitioners of airlines and related businesses worldwide, as well as senior-level government policymakers. © 2018 Nawal K. Taneja.",
Tonkiss F.,"Commodity or commons?: Knowledge, inequality, and the city",2017,"The importance of knowledge in contemporary urban economies is now well-established. While its role in post-industrial and service-intensive economies is especially critical, the ways in cities which generate, organise, and enhance knowledge is an enduring feature of urban life. Cities have always been ‘smart’. The current focus on networked, digital, and data-driven urbanisms should not obscure the fact that urban environments are by their nature systems of collective intelligence; information-rich and highly conducive to social as well as individual learning. The production and circulation of knowledge is the basis for urban innovation, key to urban competition, and central to urban productivity - not to say crucial to the cultural intensity of urban experience. Creating knowledge, simply, is one of the things that cities do, and they tend to do it well. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Tigran Haas and Hans Westlund; individual chapters, the contributors.",
"Zeng L., Szolnoki G.",Some Fundamental Facts About the Wine Market in China,2017,"This chapter provides a funnel view of the Chinese wine market from 2005 to the present day. The illustration starts with a macro assessment of the political, economic, social and technological factors; discusses the alcoholic drink market and further explores the wine market before finishing with a snapshot of the import wine sector, based on secondary research. In the early years of the reviewed decade, China's wine market impressed the globe with double-digit growth, thanks to the fast-growing Chinese economy and the push of political strategies such as the Four Changes. In the final years of the reviewed period, it transited into a shuffling phase initiated by the shock of the anticorruption campaign and the slow-down of economic growth. Now the Chinese wine market shows a trend of recovery driven by the rise of the affluent upper-middle class and digital innovations in communication and sales channels. China's wine market is entering into a new stage of growth in line with China's economy. © 2017 L. Zeng and G. Szolnoki.

Xue H.,The newest UN treaty to facilitate cross-border paperless trade in Asia and the pacific: An insight preview,2017,"The Framework Agreement on Facilitation of Cross-border Paperless Trade in Asia and the Pacific (Framework Agreement) is a new United Nations (UN) treaty adopted at the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) in May 2016. It is now open for the signature of the ESCAP Member States till September 2017. As the most recent UN treaty on trade and development, the Framework Agreement will be an important development as well as a complement to the World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade Facilitation (WTO TFA), which is effective since February 2017. The Framework Agreement creates unprecedentedly the new multilateral legal framework for facilitation of crossborder paperless trade. While maintaining the balance between international trade efficiency, transparency, regulatory compliance and development stimulation, the Framework Agreement crafts the legal mechanisms to harmonize the Member States’ national paperless trade facilities through implementing a common set of the general principles and the relevant international standards and legal instruments. Most significantly, the Framework Agreement creatively enables cross-border mutual recognition of trade-related data and documents in electronic form through its institutional arrangement and supporting operational mechanisms. The Framework Agreement also provides a dedicated intergovernmental platform for capacity building and technical assistance to enable developing countries (including the least-developed countries and landlocked developing countries) to benefit from paperless trade facilitation. The Framework Agreement will open up the new possibilities for trade facilitation and is particularly important for the development of crossborder e-commerce and global digital economy. Its impact and influence will not only be felt in Asia-Pacific region but in the whole world. There has been very few substantive research on this newest treaty law. The Author who has been the primary legal advisor of UNESCAP for the initial research, drafting, negotiation and implementation of the Framework Agreement since 2011 is able to provide the insights on both the legal texts and the in-depth designs of the Agreement. © 2017 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands.",

Rowe M.,The role of a female-only online hospitality network in the changing world of women’s independent travel,2017,"For centuries, Bedouins have been opening their doors to strangersgiving them unconditional shelter, security, and sustenance for three days. Traditional Islamic hadiths states this about hospitality, “if the guest stays longer than the ‘three days’ it becomes charity” (O’Gorman, 2010). One wonders if this ancient Bedouin tradition should be considered one of the first hospitality exchange networks. In 1949 SERVAS International-one of the first hospitality exchange networks-was founded to promote world peace. Members’ contact details were printed and distributed on paper, and homestays were arranged with the host either by the telephone or the written word. The advent of the Internet made this form of communication almost obsolete and new online hospitality networks emergedHospitality Exchange, BeWelcome, and Global Freeloaders. The most well-known is Couchsurfing, and by 2013, was estimated to have over 5.5 million global members (www.couchsurfing.org). Membership of these hospitality exchange networks is mixed gender. These computer-mediated hospitality networks, born of the sharing economy-a new socioeconomic system built around the sharing of resources-are growing in popularity. Gansky believes the world is in the midst of an economic shift which involves less owning and more sharing (Gansky, 2010). Developments in the digital age, coupled with this shared economy phenomenon, has led to a global movement whereby people are sharing their cars, their wi-fi and even their spare bedrooms. © 2017 by Apple Academic Press, Inc.",Broads abroad travel network; Female travel; Independent; Online
Akutson S.K.,Entrepreneurship curriculum development in sustaining innovativion in Nigeria,2017,"The study explores the stages of Entrepreneurship Curriculum Development in Nigeria. This is with the view to determining the influence entrepreneurship curriculum development has exerted on innovative drive in Nigeria. Various literatures as they relate to the study were reviewed and conceptualized into a framework to show the stages in which entrepreneurship curriculum have advanced in the first world economy in comparison to the stage in which the Nigeria economy operate. The study found out that entrepreneurship development in Nigeria has focused more on the explicit curriculum while neglecting the implicit curriculum. The study also concluded that Nigeria is at its early stage of entrepreneurship curriculum development which has hampered the emergence of entrepreneurs. For the few that are able to create ventures, lack of marketing skills such as using digital and social media restricts their success. In an effort to enrich the entrepreneurship curriculum development in Nigeria, the study recommends internship for students to have hands-on experience and also academic institutions should build prototype businesses on campus to expose students to entrepreneurship culture and also impart modern marketing skills among others. © 2017 Serials Publications Pvt.

Woodward D.,Agglomeration and automation in the twenty-first century: Prospects for regional research,2017,"This paper discusses the future of technology and its implications for regional agglomeration and related research. In regions with strong agglomeration economies, positive externalities generated by spatial proximity lead to higher productivity. Urban scale economies raise the productivity of people residing in dynamic cities. Firms benefit from regional clusters of similar firms. Now we are entering a second machine age, with potentially exponential growth in productivity based on pervasive, interconnected computing power, massive digital information, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and robotics. Productivity may depend more on the “cloud”-based advantage of machines, rather than “crowd”-based advantages of humans. Employment may fall with the automation of routine tasks. However, non-routine tasks requiring tacit knowledge may rise, given comparative advantages with machines. Machine learning and robotics will both substitute and complement employment. Agglomeration benefits may then accrue to regional employment based on non-routine tasks. Even so, the size and stability of agglomeration benefits will require further inquiry. With better measures of agglomeration, future research will potentially delve deeper into the three main sources of regional productivity from agglomeration: (1) better labor skill matching and local pooling; (2) more efficient input sharing along deeper and specialized supplier relationships; and (3) enhanced localized learning and knowledge flows. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",
Nagarajan U.,Stress management in service organizations,2017,"The beginning of the 21st century has brought a sea of change to the global economy. The digital revolution has turned traditional method of working on its head. The advent of computers and the internet has metamorphosed work processes and work timings and is continuously challenging existing set ups. The increased use of technology and digitalization in the workplace has led to better productivity, improved services, and lesser costs egging companies to further increase their machine power over manpower. This has led to huge job losses and increased job insecurity. It has also blurred the boundaries between home and work with employees often unofficially working round the clock. The consequence has been the creation of one of the most alarming lifestyle risk factors that the global work force suffers from today-Work Stress. WHO defines work stress as the response people may have when presented with work demands and pressures that are not matched to their knowledge and abilities and which challenge their ability to cope. The stress is often compounded by poor work organization, lack of support and control, and ambiguity in job responsibilities. This chapter explores the major causes of work-related stress across the globe. A comparative study of work stress levels in different continents show the influence of culture, government policies, economy etc. The study gives an insight as to why stress levels are different in different countries for the same or similar types of jobs. An insight approach is analyzed to how employees handle the stress and manage work life balance for making workplace better and satisfying. © 2017 by Apple Academic Press, Inc.",Employment; Job control; Karoshi; Stress; Vacation; Who; Work-life balance; Workload
"Wei F., Pokrovskaia N.N.",Digitizing of regulative mechanisms on the masterchain platform for the individualized competence portfolio,2017,"The knowledge economy requires new flexible approaches to standardization and certification. The labor market needs to define clear criteria for the competence of graduates as potential employees and participants in the business community. The requirements of employers for the skills and competencies of job candidates are reflected in vacancy announcements. The analysis demonstrates significant differences between the description of the functional roles at the workplace, given by the business, and the content of both professional and educational standards, approved by the State. The professionalizing of education requires the development of a flexible system of formulating the competences that are necessary for innovative growth of the economy, which would reflect the business' needs in the human resource and would allow the most accurate provision of opportunities for individuals' self-realization in the talent management system on corporate, regional or global level. Masterchain platform is developed in Russia as a model of distributed data, as a reliable and flexible system to record events (e.g., a register of property rights or the diploma' issuance) seems to be a convenient regulatory mechanism to harmonize the expectations of enterprises and personal interests of individuals. The paper examines the possibilities to put into operation the Masterchain platform and to form on its basis a business intelligence system to analyze and harmonize the competencies required by employers and reflected in their vacancy announcements with the individuals' personal talents and interests presented in the portfolio. © 2017 IEEE.",blockchain; digital space; economic intelligence; masterchain; transfer of knowledge

By implementing two methods, frequently encountered in digital signal processing analysis, (Undecimated Wavelet Transform and Empirical Mode Decomposition both methods extract components in the time-frequency domain), we decompose the real stock prices and the real dividends, for the US economy, into signals that correspond to distinctive frequency bands. Armed with the decomposed signals and acting within a non-linear framework, the predictability of stock prices through the use of dividends is assessed at alternative horizons. It is shown that the “new fact in finance” hypothesis is a valid proposition, provided that dividends contribute significantly to predicting stock prices at horizons spanning beyond 32 months.

"Brants K., Frissen V.",Inclusion and exclusion in the information society,2017,"Recent policy discourses in Europe strongly emphasise the need to build what is called an ‘inclusive information society’. With the current widespread diffusion and use of ICTs in all domains of everyday life, ICTs are increasingly considered a fundamental and necessary resource for every European citizen, the socio-economic effects of which will resonate across the continent. The strategic goal for Europe in 2010 - worded forcefully by the European Council in its Lisbon strategy - is: '… to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion’ (European Council, 2000). While access to ICTs is considered crucial for participation in and enhancing the qualities of that society, there is, at the same time, an accompanying nervousness that it might sow the seeds for a new exclusion, a digital divide quite distanced from the dream of an all inclusive society. © Roger Silverstone 2005.

In the Kingdom of Bahrain, many initiatives have been formulated to leverage the quality of governmental electronic services including the establishment of robust measures that provide valuable indications of satisfaction with government e-services from the perspective of stakeholders. Therefore, the current study aims to develop a recognized model based on ACSI for measuring the customer satisfaction index for the e-services in the Kingdom of Bahrain (BHCSI). For this purpose, the key factors affecting customer satisfaction with e-services will be identified. Moreover, the BHCSI will be explored for eservices at different levels using the developed model. In view of these aims, questionnaires were developed and distributed to three different types of stakeholders (residents, business and government). The main finding of this research is that the e-services provided by the iGA are accepted and used by individuals with various ages, gender, nationality and education due to the huge efforts provided by iGA to transform the Kingdom of Bahrain into a digital society and economy. Moreover, reaching a customer index (BHCSI) of 79.4 is another achievement for this small country. Many countries have failed to reach this high score, and it is therefore an outstanding accomplishment and indication of success for the iGA and the Kingdom of Bahrain. © 2017 Serials Publications Pvt.

Information dragnets increasingly yield huge quantities of individual-level data, which are analyzed to sort and slot people into categories oftaste, riskiness or worth. These tools deepen the reach of the market and define new strategies of profit-making. We present a new theoretical framework for understanding their development. We argue that (a) modern organizations follow an institutional data imperative to collect as much data as possible, (b) as a result of the analysis and use of this data, individuals accrue a form of capital flowing from their positions as measured by various digital scoring and ranking methods; and (c) the facticity of these scoring methods makes them organizational devices with potentially stratifying effects. They offer firms new opportunities to structure and price offerings to consumers. For individuals, they create classification situations that identify shared life-chances in product and service markets.

Several fingers point in the direction of the high cost of devices, lack of infrastructure, and poor/intermittent supply from providers and many more as reasons for the low uptake. A major concern that emanates from this state of affairs, especially for small firms that have to embrace technology for its acclaimed virtues, is that they have to find creative ways of reaching out to their customers, expand their customer base and generally improve their businesses. Worryingly, considering the value of small businesses in a developing economy such as South Africa, there should be sustained inquiry into the factors that prevent small businesses from blossoming. This study examines social media adoption challenges of small businesses. The purpose of pursuing a study of this kind was based on, among others what is generally considered as: (1) the necessity of social media in business, and (2) the inevitability of social media. Specifically focusing on restaurants in the Cape metropole, the study applied the quantitative method to obtain data which were analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Perhaps surprising, the results suggest that access to the internet in this digital age is one of the most prominent factors that inhibit the adoption of social media by the restaurants surveyed. Other factors include a limited understanding of the role of social media, the capacity of social media, marketing strategies and lack of interest. While there is the urge to associate non-adoption of information technology to limited education, this was not the case as most of the respondents were moderately educated with specific insights in marketing. With digital technology driving marketing efforts nowadays, clearly businesses that choose to ignore or optimally deploy this new media may suffer or continue to suffer excruciating losses. © 2017 AJHTL.",Marketing strategies; Restaurants; Social media; South Africa

"Zebryte I., Jorquera H.",Chilean tourism sector “B Corporations”: evidence of social entrepreneurship and innovation,2017,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to address the question of how social entrepreneurs achieve the desired impact-based model of business. Design/methodology/approach: Qualitative research design included semi-structured in-depth interviews with entrepreneurs of three Chilean Tourism B Corporations (B Corps), participant observation of the Latin American B Movement, and print, digital and social media clippings. Findings: This research unearths the practices by which entrepreneurs implement their aspirations of balancing profit and social impact obligations within their business models. Research limitations/implications: Though an intentional sample is not representative in quantitative terms, the employed research design allowed the authors to deepen the understanding of the processes which are taking place in Chile, Latin America, and on the Global scale. The authors concluded that social benefit commitment guides innovation in business models of Chilean entrepreneurs seeking to have a broader positive impact on vulnerable communities and the society at large. Practical implications: This research shows that traditional businesses have the possibility of hybridizing management, combining the necessary organization that defines its mission with social or environmental purposes. The latter is likely to open up new markets for traditional businesses. Social implications: Social entrepreneurship is the principal means for new generations of entrepreneurs to make changes in businesses and in vulnerable local communities through global aspirations.

"Gwangwava N., Gumbie A.A.",Mass-customization of products through web-based feature modeling systems,2017,"Innovation in e-systems has led to significant evolution in modern business and commerce. The technologies have been embraced in both 340the information and communication sectors as well as the manufacturing industry. Today’s manufacturers are pressed for short time-to-market and short product life cycles. Another significant trend that has emanated from today’s well-educated consumers is mass-customization. Consumers now demand personalized products, within short timeframes. Traditionally, consumers would buy mass-produced products off the shelf, which left them with little influence to modify product designs to suit their unique needs. Modern e-systems have come to the rescue of the consumers, who are ever becoming savvy technocrats. Thanks to the rapid evolution and ever decreasing prices for computer systems. Recently there has been more research focus on web-based systems that are earmarked at making mass- customization a possibility. Greater parts of the developed world and other major manufacturing economies such as China have made great strides in achieving mass-customization and short time-to-market, whilst close to zero achievement can be noticed in most developing parts of the world. Mass-customization requires a strong backbone of broadband and cloud based network systems, coupled with feature modeling systems. Today’s ever growing mobile applications industry enable the design of powerful mobile applications which can allow end user customers to interact with digital product models in order to personalize the designs before onward transmission to the manufacturer. This ability basically brings what is called ‘democratization’ of manufacturing. This chapter focuses on trends and practical research applications of mass-customization web-based product feature modeling systems. Typical research efforts will be demonstrated in the fields of additive manufacturing and toy manufacturing industries. Traditional mass-customization systems used to be web applications that were designed for use on the desktop computers. However, because of the growing number of mobile gadgets with Internet access (smart phones), mobile applications are now being designed with ability to communicate directly with manufacturing machines or at least the manufacturer’s proprietary network. Whilst product design and modeling systems housed within the manufacturer’s premises normally require high expertise of CAD skills, end user applications for mass-customization are designed for novices. These offer adjustments on less complicated product features and or attributes, such as color and size. The business potential of mass-customization systems is very 341huge since the outreach capacity is as big as the cloud-based network. Distribution systems are also becoming very efficient which enables remote companies to ship their mass-customized products anywhere in the world at low costs. © 2018 by Apple Academic Press, Inc.",3d printing; Feature modeling; Mass-customization; Toy manufacturing; Web application
Ahmed A.,World sustainable development outlook 2007: Knowledge management and sustainable development in the 21st century,2017,"The World Sustainable Development Outlook series has been developed to provide an overview of sustainable development, to discuss why it is important and to provoke forward thinking on the development of a more coherent approach to solving global problems related to sustainability through science and technology. In doing so, a holistic approach is used to critically examine the interrelationship between the natural, governmental, economic and social dimensions of our world and how science and technology can contribute to solutions. This is a truly global source book, which is reflected in the varied national and cultural origins of the contributors, as well as the topics and case studies covered. Each year a different theme will be covered. The theme of World Sustainable Development Outlook 2007 is the different dimensions of knowledge and technology management in the new era of information revolution and how they relate to sustainable development. Rapid innovation in information and communication technologies (ICTs) is clearly reshaping the world we live in. Countries are increasingly judged by whether they are information-rich or information-poor. It is estimated that 30-40% of the world’s economic growth and 40-50% of all new jobs will be IT-driven. Education and knowledge are the chief currencies of the modern age, and can also be a strategic resource and a lifeline for sustainable development. Yet, in Africa, millions of people have never made a telephone call. The technological gulf between developed and developing countries (DCs) is likely to widen further with the rapid expansion of the internet and the speedy transition to digitalisation in the West. The impacts on DCs may include an increase in the so-called brain drain and growing dependence on foreign aid of a different kind - knowledge aid. There are fears that knowledge imperialism is already with us. What is clear is that most of the technological innovations in ICTs are Western-designed and fail to address the needs of the most disadvantaged. The interest of industrialised countries in the use of ICTs in DCs has largely been more concerned with the profitability of their own business enterprises than with any broader goals concerning the development of the host countries. DCs face the challenge of either becoming an integral part of the knowledge-based global economy or the very real danger of finding themselves on the wrong side of the digital divide. Successful management in the new millennium requires developing new methods and approaches to meet the challenges and opportunities of this information revolution while at the same time fostering sustainable development. Adopting a holistic approach, this book aims to critically examine the interrelationship between these different issues in order to reach solutions and a consensus for a better future, taking into account a variety of international, institutional and intellectual perspectives. It uses case and country studies in technological innovation and experience so that lessons in effective management of ICTs can be learned from successful initiatives, ideas and innovations. © 2007 Allam Ahmed.",

Although new information and communication technologies are changing business practices significantly and offer new business opportunities, they also raise online privacy concerns. Major issue is to determine how to decrease online privacy concerns and increase consumer confidence in interacting with companies in the online environment. This research seeks to identify influential factors that affect online privacy concerns and their consequences for consumer behaviour. The data collected from student sample were analysed by using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, and structural equation modelling. Results indicate that third-party seal assurance, previous online experience, time spent online and gender significantly affect privacy concerns, while consumer attitudes towards relationship marketing and income were not shown to have significant impact. When designing privacy policy, marketers should take into consideration those factors to alleviate privacy concerns, which will in turn increase purchases over the Internet.

Wentrup R.,The online–offline balance: internationalization for Swedish online service providers,2016,"Online service providers (OSPs) are becoming increasingly important in the global economy and are undertaking internationalization at a remarkable speed. Since they depend on digital delivery over the internet, OSPs are portrayed as footloose in their geographical expansion and are often described as “born global.” However, on the basis of three case studies, the paper reveals the importance of the home market as a springboard, and of regional expansion in the early phase of internationalization. The paper emphasizes the balance in the internationalization process between an online and an offline presence in the new international market. The time gap between online and offline presence, the online-to-offline interval, seems to be a critical factor in the internationalization process. The speed of the internet industry and the technically complex nature of online services could explain why the case firms chose controlled modes of entry. The case firms thus skip sequential steps, following a pattern that is in contrast to the Uppsala model. Overall, the paper suggests that finding the right balance between the online and the offline presence is a challenge in the internationalization of these particular Swedish OSP firms. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Born globals; Internationalization; Internet; Online service providers; Online–offline interval; OSP; Uppsala model
Humbert Genand M.-A.,The Regulatory Environment for Wine in China,2016,"China's accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001 has been the source of major changes and important reforms in its laws. For example, the concept of geographical indications (GIs) was not originally included in the Trademark Law but it was confirmed in the latest Trademark Law which entered into force on May 1, 2014. The interest of the country to attract foreign investment and technology at the end of the 1970s was a stimulating factor in the introduction of an intellectual property policy and the harmonization of the laws with regard to GIs, as was the Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights Agreement. Thus, in 1989, there was a circular issued by the State Administration for Industry and Commerce concerning the cessation of the use of the name 'Champagne' in relation to alcoholic drinks. China's economic rapid growth also gave more opportunities for doing business, including in the wine sector. As a result, there are nowadays few major differences between Chinese laws and those of other countries despite the fact that China is not part to the International Organization of Vine and Wine. Furthermore, precautions are needed for wine producers to protect and enforce their rights in a country where counterfeiting could represent 10% of the gross domestic product. This is particularly true in view of the new challenges in a digital economy. This chapter focuses particularly on the French experience but with implications which are relevant for wine producers and importers from all countries. © 2017 M.-A. Genand.

Kreft J.,Algorithm as demiurge: A complex myth of new media,2016,"Plato's Demiurge is the quintessence of perfection and power. ""Whatever comes from me is indestructible unless I, myself, wish it to be destroyed"" - says the creator of the gods, speaking to them in Timaeus. The gods and Demiurge are believed to collaborate on the creation of people in accordance with the standard of excellent ideas; soon the world, as we know, will be created. Plato's Demiurge is also the good, and the platonic gods are righteous. Without Demiurge the world is a chaos, an environment of irrational chances. Nowadays, the myth of Demiurge can be related to the perfection of creativity. Demiurge becomes equal to the anticipated, all-powerful driving force. Omnipotent, yet tamed and friendly. Demiurge is also the leader in the tradition of social research, the ""divine"" constructor ofthe economy, the originator of development. In the new media environment, Demiurge is a convenient metaphor for the presentation of the algorithm: Mysterious, error-free, resistant to influence, free from human weaknesses. A transcendent being. The aim of this publication is to present new concept, the core myth of new media organizations - the myth of Demiurge associated with the operation of algorithms and critical analysis of myths created around it, which accompany the social, political and business role of algorithms. Considering the aspect connected with the interpretation of digital media operation and their social and business role, algorithms have not been so far analysed in the context of the presence of myths in organisational functioning. The author believes, however, that the common factor in the perception of algorithms in new media is their mythical aureole and mythical thinking associated with them.",

"Williams F., Philip L., Farrington J., Fairhurst G.",‘Digital by Default’ and the ‘hard to reach’: Exploring solutions to digital exclusion in remote rural areas,2016,"In the UK, the geography of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure required for Internet connectivity is such that high speed broadband and mobile phone networks are generally less available in rural areas compared with urban areas or, in other words, as remoteness and population sparsity increase so too does the likelihood of an area having no or very poor broadband connectivity. Against a policy backdrop of UK Government efforts to bring forward network infrastructure upgrades and to improve the accessibility of broadband services in locations where there is a weak commercial investment case, this paper considers the options for the ‘final few’ in the prevailing ‘Digital by Default’ public services context. The paper outlines the Rural Public Access WiFi Services project, a study focused upon enabling Internet connectivity for commercially ‘hard to reach’ rural areas in the UK. The Rural Public Access WiFi Services concept and the experiment are introduced before findings from a pilot deployment of a broadband service to households in a remote rural area, who may be classified as ‘digitally excluded’, are presented. The paper then reflects on our field experiment and the potential of the Rural Public Access WiFi Services service model as a solution to overcoming some of the digital participation barriers manifest in the urban–rural divide. Early indications show that the Rural Public Access WiFi Services model has the potential to encourage participation in the Digital Economy and could aid the UK Government’s Digital by Default agenda, although adoption of the model is not without its challenges. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.",Digital by Default; final few; hard to reach; rural broadband infrastructure
"Kathan W., Matzler K., Veider V.",The sharing economy: Your business model's friend or foe?,2016,"The sharing economy, a rising pattern in consumption behavior that is based on accessing and reusing products to utilize idle capacity, presents both tremendous possibilities and significant threats for emerging as well as incumbent businesses. As of today, it is unclear whether this economy is merely another ephemeral trend in consumption or whether we are experiencing a real shift in how goods are accessed, distributed, and used. Furthermore, little is known about how existing business models are affected by the sharing economy. These two issues represent the central motivation for the development of this article. Consequently, an examination of why the sharing economy has the potential to produce a long-term transformation in consumption behavior is followed by a consideration of how this change might affect companies’ business models. Based on a renowned business model framework and a variety of current illustrative examples, we propose central questions managers must ask themselves in order to be prepared to respond to changes brought about by this new economic trend. © 2016 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University",Access versus ownership; Access-based consumption; Business model adaption; Collaborative consumption; Digital transformation; Sharing economy; Sustainability
"Deichmann U., Goyal A., Mishra D.",Will digital technologies transform agriculture in developing countries?,2016,"Mobile phones and the internet have significantly affected practically all sectors of the economy and agriculture is no exception. Building on a recent World Bank flagship report, this article introduces a concise framework for describing the main benefits from new information and communication technologies. They promote greater inclusion in the broader economy, raise efficiency by complementing other production factors, and foster innovation by dramatically reducing transaction costs. The article reviews the recent literature on corresponding technology impacts in the rural sector in developing countries. Digital technologies overcome information problems that hinder market access for many small-scale farmers, increase knowledge through new ways of providing extension services, and they provide novel ways for improving agricultural supply chain management. While there are many promising examples of positive impacts on rural livelihoods—or “digital dividends”—these have often not scaled up to the extent expected. The main reason is that technology can always only address some, but not all of the barriers faced by farmers in poorer countries. 2016 The World Bank Agricultural Economics © 2016 International Association of Agricultural Economists",Agricultural productivity; Information and communication technology (ICT); World development
"Billon M., Lera-Lopez F., Marco R.",ICT use by households and firms in the EU: links and determinants from a multivariate perspective,2016,"The progress toward a digital economy in Europe involves boosting ICT use in various environments, such as households and firms. Studies available at the regional level in Europe focus on ICT use by households. This paper sheds light on the digital divide by exploring the differences in ICT use across European regions, investigating simultaneously not only ICT use by households but also by firms. Using canonical correlation analysis, we first explore the existence of regional patterns of ICT use in Europe. Second, we test the influence of regional characteristics to explain ICT use by households and firms. Our results identify a first pattern defined by the regions that combine high levels of both ICT uses. This pattern is explained primarily by the quality of the regional government, knowledge-intensive services and economic development variables. A divide between southern and northern, and western and eastern regions is detected. We also identify a second pattern that captures ICT use by firms (not related to the first), predominantly determined by educational variables and some economic factors. This pattern does not exhibit the geographical digital divide found in the first. The findings show that there are synergies and regional factors explaining the use of ICT both at home and at work at the regional level in Europe that should be considered when designing public policy geared toward encouraging ICT diffusion. © 2016, Kiel Institute.",Digital divide; Firms; Households; ICT skills; Internet; Regions
Wade R.H.,Industrial Policy in Response to the Middle-income Trap and the Third Wave of the Digital Revolution,2016,"The ‘middle-income trap’ (MIT) is ‘real enough’ for policy makers in developing countries to take it as a serious threat to prospects for achieving ‘high’ average income. Those prospects are further clouded by the major changes occurring as the digital revolution moves from connecting people to the internet to connecting the internet to everything else, across many sectors of human life (the Third Wave). Both sets of forces raise the potential advantages of pro-active industrial policy. Yet mainstream economic thinking – and the consensus of international development organizations like the World Bank – has long tended to disapprove of it, in the spirit of ‘The best industrial policy is none at all’. In light of the middle-income trap, the Third Wave, and other conditions in the world economy, this essay discusses some of the big issues in the design of industrial policy, on the theme of how to do it well rather than how to do it less. © 2016 University of Durham and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd",

Mechanistic models to estimate these parameters are necessary to perform integrated assessments of solid waste management alternatives using a life-cycle approach; however, models are only as good as their parameterization. This study presents operational waste collection data that can be used in life-cycle models for areas with similar collection systems, and provides illustrative results from a collection process model using operational data. Fuel use and times associated with various aspects of waste collection were obtained for vehicles collecting mixed residential (residual) waste, recyclables, and yard waste from single-family residences in selected municipalities. The total average fuel economy for similarly-sized diesel collection vehicles was 0.6-1.4 km/L (1.4–3.3 mpg (miles per gallon)) for residual waste and 0.8–1 km/L (1.9–2.4 mpg) for recyclables. For residual waste and recyclables collection stops, the average time to collect at each residence using automated collection was 11–12 s and 13–17 s, respectively. The average time between stops was 11–12 s and 10–13 for residuals and recyclables, respectively. A single yard waste route was observed, and all collection times were longer than those measured for either recycling or residual waste. Unload or tip times were obtained or measured at a landfill, transfer station, and material recovery facility (MRF). Average time to unload was 7–9 min at a MRF, 14–22 min at a landfill, and 11 min at a transfer station. Commercial and multi-family collection vehicles tend to have longer stops and spend more time between stops than single-family collection, and a larger portion of fuel is used while driving relative to single-family collection. Roll-off vehicles, which collect more waste per stop, spend longer at each stop and drive longer distances between stops than front-loader vehicles. Diesel roll-offs averaged 2.4 km/L (5.7 mpg) and front-loaders averaged 1.4 km/L (3.3 mpg). © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Collection; Collection distance; Collection fuel efficiency; Collection time; Municipal solid waste
"Summerbell D.L., Barlow C.Y., Cullen J.M.",Potential reduction of carbon emissions by performance improvement: A cement industry case study,2016,"The cement industry is generally considered responsible for upwards of 5% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. This is a result of the high energy intensity of the process, significant CO2 release from the raw materials used, and large global consumption. It is also a high growth sector as emerging economies develop their infrastructure. This paper outlines an investigation into day-to-day performance variation that, if scaled to the global level, represents a potential for improvement of up to 100 Mt CO2 equivalent per year. Optimising this operational variation is not included in current roadmaps for reduction of cement industry CO2 emissions, and has the potential to be cost neutral, or even save money for cement producing companies. The paper analyses a case study of a plant in the UK, operating a pre-calciner type kiln commissioned in 1986. Production data was analysed to examine the day-to-day variation in the fuel-derived CO2 emissions, in order to estimate the potential for operational improvement. Various factors were then analysed to determine what drives this potential improvement, including fuel mix, rate of production, and process airflow. The day-to-day performance of the plant, as measured by the fuel-derived CO2 emissions per tonne of clinker produced, varied significantly. (Clinker is the material ground and mixed with ∼3% gypsum to produce cement). Improvement of the plant to 10th percentile best observed performance levels would represent a 10% drop in CO2 emissions and a 7% drop in energy consumption, with associated cost savings. Two mathematical models were used, first to examine the energy balance of the plant and then to predict CO2 emissions from given input conditions. The largest source of energy consumption was the dissociation energy required to form clinker, however, the variation in this was small. Airflow and fuel type were found to dominate the variation of performance. Optimising the factors affecting performance was predicted to reduce energy consumption by 8.5% and CO2 emissions by 19.5%. The paper concludes that there exists significant opportunity to reduce the emissions from cement plants by operational means, and that fuel mix and excess air ratio should be the focus of future research. © 2016 The Authors",Cement; CO2 emissions; Energy efficiency; Fuel efficiency; Green manufacturing; Performance improvement

To answer this question, this paper analyses the changing temporal and spatial orientation of economic valuations in increasingly digitalized economies, in which markets can no longer be understood as locally bound and closed sites of valuation and exchange. Drawing on ethnographic material from the fishing industry, the paper shows how digital tracking technologies link and synchronize auction markets with real-time information on fishing activities. Hence, ‘scopic media’ such as chart plotters and computer screens are not only deployed by skippers to monitor one another, but are also used as valuation devices that recontextualize local knowledge for the purpose of coping with economic uncertainty. As a consequence of this panoptic valuation regime, fishermen control their virtual identities by disciplining harvesting practices according to their buyers’ expectations. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",digital technology; economization; markets; scopic media; uncertainty; valuation

Britto J.N.P.,A regional perspective of the creative economy in Brazil [Economia criativa no Brasil: Uma perspectiva regional],2016,"In a knowledge‑based economy, initiatives based on the Creative Economy framework are supposed to promote regional economic diversification in developing countries. In Brazil, policy initiatives have focused on those activities with a view to design public policies oriented to reducing socio‑economic and regional inequalities, as well as spreading those activities throughout the territory, especially towards less favored regions. Based on the Brazilian experience, this article discusses whether the pre‑existing regional distribution of various types of creative activities favors or hinders the reduction of regional inequalities as a result of a policy focused on promoting creative activities and what actions could be adopted to achieve this result. Specifically, the paper discusses whether this expansion can promote an effective reduction of regional inequalities in terms of the number and quality of jobs and wage levels associated with those activities. The analysis suggests that the regional decentralization of creative activities towards less developed regions has been relatively limited in Brazil, as the more developed regions have remained more specialized in trades with higher digital and technological content, while the less developed regions have remained relatively more specialized in activities related to the cultural heritage. To reduce this imbalance, the support of local institutions and S&T infrastructure related to creative activities appears to be very important, which points out to the relevance of comprehensive policies well‑adapted to very diverse local realities. This effort should have the impact of new digital‑based technologies converge with the strengthening of economic potential of local and regional cultural heritage, by enhancing professional qualification of workers devoted to those activities. © 2016, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro.

Therefore, learners in the digital learning status also were lack of interaction and discussion among others, including teachers and other learning participants. According to this condition, flipped teaching was raised to enhance learning outside the classroom. This study aims to understand the application of the conventional flipped teaching to supplement classroom teaching, the understanding of their implementation procedures, key factors and the effectiveness of learning and teaching strategies to develop a flipped teaching model. Literatures were explored to analyze the status regarding flipped learning. Invited teachers who implemented flipped teaching had participated in-depth interviews for teaching practice.

"Tan Y., Carrillo J.E., Cheng H.K.",The Agency Model for Digital Goods,2016,"While digital goods industries such as entertainment, software, and publishing are growing at a rapid pace, traditional supply chain contract models have failed to evolve with the new digital economy. To illustrate, the agency model utilized by the e-book publishing industry has recently received much negative attention brought by the U.S. Department of Justice's lawsuit against Apple, Inc. The emerging agency model in the e-book industry works as follows: the publisher sets the price of the digital goods and the retailers who serve as agents retain a percentage of the revenue associated with a consumer purchase. The regulators claim that the agency model is hurting this industry as well as the consumer's welfare because e-book prices have increased after the introduction of the agency model. We investigate the strategic impact of the agency model by examining a digital goods supply chain with one supplier and two competing retailers. In comparison to the benchmark wholesale model, we find that the agency model can coordinate the competing retailers by dividing the coordinated profits into a prenegotiated revenue sharing proportion. Further, we also identify the Pareto improving region whereby both the supplier and the retailers prefer the agency model to the wholesale model. Our main qualitative insight regarding the agency model still holds even when we consider the presence of the printed books in the marketplace. Thus, contrary to current press presaging the negative impact of the agency model on the e-books industry, we find the agency model to be superior to the traditional wholesale contracts for publishers, retailers and consumers in this digital goods industry. © 2015 Decision Sciences Institute",and Supply Chain Contracts; Coordination Mechanism; E-book Industry; Pricing
"Pera R., Viglia G., Furlan R.",Who Am I? How Compelling Self-storytelling Builds Digital Personal Reputation,2016,"The work explores whether self-storytelling is a powerful predictor of personal reputation in a collaborative community of the sharing economy realm. By proposing that powerful self-storytelling allows an attractive positioning in respect to potential others, the paper extends the literature of brand storytelling and brand archetypes shifting the perspective to a personal level. This study adopts a qualitative-quantitative approach to investigate the meanings and stories contained in personal profile descriptions and their relation with reputation. Personal descriptions are interpreted as storytelling activities, labels/glosses that allow members to access the services of the community by facilitating personal reputation building. The findings show that powerful storytelling structures have defined phases and are crucial in reputation building when the story evolves in a metaphoric, symbolic lesson. The presence of archetypes, in particular the Sage and the Ruler, also confers reputational power to the stories. The results reveal opportunities for peer-to-peer communities, traditional companies, and social businesses. Marketers should design tools and platforms able to trigger consumers' desire to express their individuality through personal descriptions and suggest the drivers that affect reputation. © 2015 Marketing EDGE.org.",Archetypes; Personal reputation; Sharing economy; Storytelling
"Sadok M., Chatta R., Bednar P.","ICT for development in Tunisia: ""Going the last mile""",2016,"This paper seeks to provide an overview of achievements and caveats related to ICT strategies for development in Tunisia. We go beyond a conventional approach of digital divide by considering exclusion from or inequalities in access to high-speed wired broadband infrastructure as a significant explanative variable in this area. Accordingly, we link the roles of ICT as enablers of new opportunities for socio-economic growth to the development of the last mile of the wired broadband infrastructure. Our analysis of the Tunisian ICT environment shows a prevalence of mobile technologies for Internet access and telephony as well as regional and social disparities in availability, access to and use of wired broadband technologies and services. Despite the real interest of Tunisian society and economy in using Internet, the range of broadband enabled-services and applications is rather limited. Additionally, the Tunisian case provides a promising perspective as there is a relatively well developed fibre backbone and potentially good opportunity for developing the last mile of wired infrastructure. We therefore suggest that it is necessary to develop a governmental policy in collaboration with the private sector to further develop the last mile section as well as to overcome weaknesses in the current regulatory frameworks. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",Developing country; Digital exclusion; ICT; Optical fibre; Tunisia; Wired broadband

"Hasan R., Birgach M.",Critical success factors behind the sustainability of the Sharing Economy,2016,"Whether you are renting a text book (textbookrentals.com), sharing a ride (Uber), or looking for a safe and convenient place to spend the night (Airbnb) you are part of a growing economy referred to as the Sharing Economy. There are an increasing number of emerging startups that have embraced this economic model and have become giant enterprises with record-breaking revenues in an abnormally short period of time. But is the Sharing Economy sustainable enough to grow and prosper in the future? This paper investigated the critical success factors behind the promising prospects of the Sharing Economy and concludes that the Sharing Economy is a sustainable economic model. There are various factors behind this premise such as a new emerging class of consumers with a keen interest in sharing; price consciousness; a robust business model; a growing perception of the eco-efficiency of the sharing economy; and an emergent business-to-business (B2B) sector that contributes to operating at maximum capacity. All the aforementioned factors coupled with advances in information technology and software engineering, especially in social media and digital platforms, have created a unique environment for the growth and acceleration of the sharing economy. © 2016 IEEE.",Airbnb; Collaborative consumption; Digital Platforms; Peer-to-peer consumption; Sharing Economic Model; Sharing Economy; Social Media; Uber
Mróz B.,Online piracy: An emergent segment of the shadow economy. Empirical insight from Poland,2016,"Purpose-The purpose of this paper is to investigate the underlying causes, scale and scope as well as the effects of piracy as a form of the shadow economy throughout Poland, drawing on the findings of secondary studies and author's questionnaire survey conducted in summer 2013. Design/methodology/approach - An online questionnaire survey was accomplished using the computer-assisted Web interview method and real-time sampling technique, in June 2013. The survey involved 1,000 persons aged 15 years and older. Findings-Polish consumers use pirated content, products and services primarily for financial reasons:73 per cent of respondents point out to high prices of original products, while more than half (56 per cent) points at low incomes of Polish consumers. A significant percentage of respondents (over one-third) indicates the easiness of access to pirated goods and services. The most common activity among Polish internet users is to copy pirated music files (almost 40 per cent of internet users admit to that) and films (including watching the series in the network to which approximately 35 per cent of respondents confess to). These two kinds of files are also copied the most often - about 20 per cent of the respondents copy them once a month or more often. One-fourth of the respondents admit to copying pirated computer programs. The findings from the survey reveal that young Polish internet users demonstrate a rather permissive attitude towards online piracy that involves downloading music files or video and sharing them with other network users. Research limitations/implications-The questionnaire survey did not cover all aspects of online purchasing behaviour of Polish internet users. The findings of the survey should be approached with some caution, given the intricate and sensitive nature of the research problématique. Practical implications-Regulations regarding online purchases of goods and services are not attuned to the digital reality, which is exploited by online intermediaries. The research findings highlighted the motivational and behavioural aspects of Poles' online consumer behaviour, thus providing useful tips to curb online piracy. Social implications-The implementation of relevant regulations to ensure respect and protection for intellectual property rights on the internet in Polish as well as EU legislation has acquired a rare immediacy and may reduce the scope of online piracy and other manifestations of shadow economy in the cyberspace.

Mass customisation (MC) is about developing a customised product on demand for a particular customer after reception of a real order and producing it with the similar operational efficiency as one would anticipate from a mass-produced product. MC takes into account the merits of both the earlier systems of production, i.e. mass production and craft production. The craft production satisfies the personalised demands of customers and the mass production produces a limited variety of products at lower cost. Industries in developing countries such as India confront pressure from several perspectives to adopt MC. This study has been presented in the context of Indian manufacturing industries, and particularly for footwear industries to examine the enablers of MC. Achieving MC, however, require certain enabling technologies and processes in place. Several such enablers have been identified from the research literature. The objective of this study it to key out significantly important enablers for MC using interpretive structural modelling (ISM), and develop a hierarchy of these enablers for the Indian footwear units. ISM results show that modularity-based practices, digital manufacturing practices and supply chain integration are the most important MC enablers. Enhanced flexibility and responsiveness in the footwear production system can be achieved through modular and reconfigurable production system. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",India footwear industry; interpretive structural modelling (ISM); mass customisation enablers (MCE); mass customisation production system
"Kosmopoulou G., Liu Q., Shuai J.",Customer poaching and coupon trading,2016,"The price discrimination literature typically makes the assumption of no consumer arbitrage. This assumption is increasingly violated in the digital economy, where coupons are traded with increased frequency online. In this paper, we analyze the welfare impacts of coupon trading using a modified Hotelling model where firms send coupons to poach each other’s loyal customers. The possibility of coupon trading renders this important instrument for price discrimination less effective. Moreover, coupon distribution has unintended consequences when coupon traders sell coupons back to a firm’s loyal customers. Consequently, coupon trading may reduce firms’ incentive to distribute coupons, leading to higher prices and profits. We find that, an increase in coupon distribution cost lowers promotion frequency but raises promotion depth, and an increase in the fraction of coupon traders lowers both promotion frequency and promotion depth. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Wien.",Consumer arbitrage; Coupon trading; Customer poaching

A critical challenge faced by SME leaders, as a consequence of the continuing digital technology revolution, is how to optimally align business strategy with digital technology to fully leverage the potential offered by these technologies in pursuit of longevity and growth. There is a paucity of empirical research examining how e-leadership in SMEs drives successful alignment between business strategy and digital technology fostering longevity and growth. To address this gap, in this paper we develop an empirically derived e-leadership model. Initially we develop a theoretical model of e-leadership drawing on strategic alignment theory. This provides a theoretical foundation on how SMEs can harness digital technology in support of their business strategy enabling sustainable growth. An in-depth empirical study was undertaken interviewing 42 successful European SME leaders to validate, advance and substantiate our theoretically driven model. The outcome of the two stage process - inductive development of a theoretically driven e-leadership model and deductive advancement to develop a complete model through in-depth interviews with successful European SME leaders - is an e-leadership model with specific constructs fostering effective strategic alignment. The resulting diagnostic model enables SME decision makers to exercise effective e-leadership by creating productive alignment between business strategy and digital technology improving longevity and growth prospects. © 2016 JIT Palgrave Macmillan.",digital technology; e-leadership; organisational change; small- and medium-sized enterprises; strategic alignment

"Acquisti A., Taylor C., Wagman L.",The economics of privacy,2016,"This article summarizes and draws connections among diverse streams of theoretical and empirical research on the economics of privacy. We focus on the economic value and consequences of protecting and disclosing personal information, and on consumers' understanding and decisions regarding the trade-offs associated with the privacy and the sharing of personal data. We highlight how the economic analysis of privacy evolved over time, as advancements in information technology raised increasingly nuanced and complex issues. We find and highlight three themes that connect diverse insights from the literature. First, characterizing a single unifying economic theory of privacy is hard, because privacy issues of economic relevance arise in widely diverse contexts. Second, there are theoretical and empirical situations where the protection of privacy can both enhance and detract from individual and societal welfare. Third, in digital economies, consumers' ability to make informed decisions about their privacy is severely hindered because consumers are often in a position of imperfect or asymmetric information regarding when their data is collected, for what purposes, and with what consequences. We conclude the article by highlighting some of the ongoing issues in the privacy debate of interest to economists. (JEL D82, D83, G20, I10, L13, M31, M37).",

"Guo J., Zheng X., Chen Z.-M.",How does coal price drive up inflation? Reexamining the relationship between coal price and general price level in China,2016,"Due to the coal-dominated energy structure, China is currently facing significant economic uncertainties brought forward by instability of coal price. By separating the asymmetric effects that how upward and downward coal price changes pass through to the economy, this paper reexamines the relationship between coal price and general price level in China. The asymmetric effects are investigated via vector autoregression models, Granger Causality tests, and impulse response function analyses using the monthly time series data from Jun-98 to Sep-14. Results show negative coal price change presents more significant impact on inflation than positive one. The inflation responses very abruptly to coal price shock in the short run, but the impact regresses rapidly along time. Accumulatively, a 1% increase of coal price will push CPI and PPI up by 0.04% and 0.12%, while a 1% decrease of coal price will pull them down by 0.08% and 0.17%, respectively. The linkage among coal price change, PPI, and CPI is demonstrated as the main transmission channel of price shock. The inflationary effect is strong in the initial stage, but will be weakened in the later stage since the pass through effect from PPI to CPI is tiny, which confirms PPI is more responsive than CPI to coal price change. For policy implications, how to avoid extreme volatility in general price level is a major concern of recent agendas such as reforming energy market and building green fiscal system. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Asymmetric effects; Coal price; Energy policy; Inflation

Landini F.,The evolution of control in the digital economy,2016,"Control over digital transactions has steadily risen in recent years, to an extent that puts into question the Internet’s traditional openness. To investigate the origins and effects of such change, the paper formally models the historical evolution of digital control. In the model, the economy-wide features of the digital space emerge as a result of the endogenous adaptation (co-evolution) of users’ preferences (culture) and platform designs (technology). The model shows that: a) in the digital economy there exist two stable cultural-technological equilibria: one with intrinsically motivated users and low control; and the other with purely extrinsically motivated users and high control; b) before the opening of the Internet to commerce, the emergence of a low-control-intrinsic-motivation equilibrium was favored by the specific set of norms and values that formed the early culture of the networked environment; and c) the opening of the Internet to commerce can indeed cause a transition to a high-control-extrinsic-motivation equilibrium, even if the latter is Pareto inferior. Although it is too early to say whether such a transition is actually taking place, these results call for a great deal of attention in evaluating policy proposals on Internet regulation. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Endogenous preferences; Evolutionary games; Internet control; Internet regulation; Motivation; On-line law enforcement; Technology

Additionally, people are seldom at their company site, especially in small and medium sized companies (SME) the key personnel are often on the road. There they have no access to their digital files and information resources of their companies. This paper describes the architecture concept of a mobile collaborative environment addressing these problems. © 2008 Nottingham University.",Collaborative Work Environment; Mobility; Virtual Engineering; Virtual Organisations
"Li F., Nucciarelli A., Roden S., Graham G.",How smart cities transform operations models: A new research agenda for operations management in the digital economy,2016,"The notion of smart cities is growing in prominence in the digital economy. The integration of urban infrastructures with information and communication technologies enables the development of new operations models. Digitised infrastructures offer opportunities for public and private organisations to design and deliver more customer-centric products or services, particularly for those that require geographical proximity with consumers in the online to offline (O2O) context. A framework is developed and used to analyse three case examples. These cases illustrate the emergence of new operations models and, demonstrate how smart cities are redefining the characteristics of operations models around their scalability, analytical output and connectivity. We also explore the feasibility, vulnerability and acceptability of each new operation. This paper contributes to our understanding of how smart cities can potentially transform operational models, and sets out a research agenda for operations management in smart cities in the digital economy. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",big data; digital economy; online to offline (O2O); operations model; Smart city; transformation
Bonilla D.,"Urban vans, e-commerce and road freight transport",2016,"A city will typically depend on at least 150 supply chains and freight is a key part of them. This article aims to explore at the qualitative and qualitative level (1) how e-commerce drives both travel and urban freight transport and (2) to estimate how various manufacturing activities determine the stability of demand for freight transport. The article provides elasticity estimates on (1) the demand for road freight transport for five industry sectors using a time series framework; data on GDP (gross value added) and on fuel costs per t-km (tonne-km). A key finding is that e-commerce induces freight traffic, by vans, but the decline in freight intensity of the economy is only temporary since urban economic activity contributes to growth of freight. Our analysis of five manufacturing sectors confirms that cyclical sectors are more sensitive to energy price gyrations over time than non-cyclical sectors. Price elasticities are high but comparable to other studies. The income elasticity of freight transport is large for the five sectors, but the high heterogeneity of freight sectors means that predicting this activity is challenging. It is observed that truck freight intensity (km of trucks per GVA) declines but not enough to offset the rise in energy needed to fuel the entire freight transport sector; it is likely that the rise in van freight increases the demand for freight energy in urban regions. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",decoupling trends; road freight transport; Van traffic

The review of data and of available literature reveals that entrepreneurship is increasingly being promoted in Oman as part of a strategy to promote the diversification of economy in light of declining oil prices and depleting oil reserves. With a view of exploring the scope of social media related services as a means of entrepreneurial ventures, the potential benefits of social media for businesses, the possible opportunities and challenges in entrepreneurship in social media management and marketing services in Oman have been reviewed and highlighted. The review reveals that in Oman and across the Arab region, as social media usage by businesses is gaining prominence, the lack of digital skills could act as a promoter for outsourcing of social media to external social media service agencies. The studies also reveal the gap between client expectations and the currently available services. In this light, the study concludes that this is a viable area for research that merits further exploration. © 2016 The authors.",Entrepreneurship; Social media; Social media agency; Social media marketing; Sultanate of Oman

Gandini A.,Digital work: Self-branding and social capital in the freelance knowledge economy,2016,"Existing research shows that self-branding in the knowledge economy is a key promotional device for the pursuit of self-realization in a context that reifies entrepreneurialism as the main ideological stance. However, there is still reluctance to fully acknowledge the processes of sociality that constitute self-branding practice. While the relationship between branding and the affective dynamics of social production of value fostered by the diffusion of Web 2.0 is widely acknowledged in the literature, there still seems to be a lack of understanding of the extent to which self-branding relates to social relationships in the production of socialized value for individuals. The study of self-branding practices across digital freelance professions in the knowledge economy reveals how social media has come to represent a working tool that serves the curation of a professional image and the management of social relationships via the enactment of performative practices of sociality, which exist around a shared notion of reputation as value. Here, self-branding becomes an investment in social relationships with expected return for the acquisition of a reputation. This substantially equates self-branding with what social theory calls social capital, being instrumental to secure employment in the freelance-based labour market of the digital knowledge economy. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.",Digital media; digital work; freelance; knowledge work; reputation; self-branding; social capital

The challenging problem for performance measurement and management (PMM) in the digital era is twofold: firstly, the constant change in the external environment is compelling PMM to be more dynamic. Secondly, organisations have to deal with different varieties and volumes of data to create competitive advantage. The aim of this paper is to explore how PMM models and practices should be renovated to be resilient and reflect advances in the digital economies. Literature review on the state of the art was conducted covering the issues faced by organisations in the digital economies and their relevance to PMM. A case study was conducted to explore the practitioner perceptions of dealing with the issues faced in digital economies as well as to understand how they are making changes to their PMM. The key findings from the study include: (1) Organisations should refocus their measurement efforts to incorporate evaluation of their performance over a wider network involving various stakeholders. (2) Organisations need to understand how technological developments could create competitive advantage through their strategy and deploy it to relevant positivistic and behavioural measures. © 2016 The Author(s).

"Crichton S.E., Carter D.",Taking making into the schools: An immersive professional development approach,2016,"This chapter introduces professional learning (PL) challenges in a Digital Age and makes a case for an immersive, sustained, experiential approach including diverse groups of professionals. It explores how this approach informed novice and experienced educators to incorporate design thinking and making into their current practice. After providing background on the Maker Movement, an immersive PL model is explored. This model comprises an integrated series of PL experiences designed to encourage participants to actively engage in four distinct yet related elements. Drawing on a qualitative, iterative process, initial research findings and experiences suggest that such a model may support good PL and professional development for educators designing and developing 21st century learning environments. These findings suggest this model may allow for collaborative re-thinking of established course and curricular designs, while addressing significant social issues, encouraging participants to become thoughtful contributors in an increasingly complex, globalized economy. © 2016 by IGI Global.

"Sasson A., Johnson J.C.","The 3D printing order: variability, supercenters and supply chain reconfigurations",2016,"Purpose – Direct digital manufacturing (DDM) is conceived of as either disrupting the entire manufacturing economy or merely enabling novel production. The purpose of this paper is to introduce an alternative where DDM coexists with and complements traditional mass production. When multiple parts run across one manufacturing line, DDM can isolate variability associated with low volume part production and may be preferred to mass production despite being expensive. If DDM complements rather than cannibalizes mass production, this alters the understanding of who adopts DDM, the products built with DDM, and DDM’s long-term supply chain implications. Design/methodology/approach – This invited paper explores a DDM rollout scenario and qualitatively assesses potential supply chain reconfigurations. Findings – The analysis recognizes that existing manufacturers with heterogeneous bills-of-material may develop DDM capabilities to isolate disruptive, low-volume production from scalable mass production. Developing DDM competence and raw material scale advantages, these manufacturers become the locus of change in a manufacturing landscape increasingly characterized by multi-product DDM supercenters. Originality/value – Extant research largely focusses on two potential reasons for DDM adoption: cost-per-unit and time-to-delivery comparisons. The authors explore a third driver: DDM’s capacity to isolate manufacturing variability attributable to low volume parts. Relative to the extant literature, this suggests a different DDM rollout, different adopters, and a different supply chain configuration. The authors identify mass manufacturing variability reduction as the mechanism through which DDM may be adopted. This adoption trajectory would eventually enable a supply chain transition in which spare parts inventory migrates from finished goods at proprietary facilities to raw materials at generalized DDM supercenters. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",3D printing; Direct digital manufacturing DDM; Economies of scale and scope; Long tail; Manufacturing supercenters; Supply chain

"Leibowicz B.D., Krey V., Grubler A.",Representing spatial technology diffusion in an energy system optimization model,2016,"In this study, we develop a series of technology diffusion formulations that endogenously represent empirically observed spatial diffusion patterns. We implement these formulations in the energy system optimization model MESSAGE to assess their implications for the market penetration of low-carbon electricity generation technologies. In our formulations, capacity growth is constrained by a technology's knowledge stock, which is an accumulating and depreciating account of prior capacity additions. Diffusion from an innovative core to less technologically adept regions occurs through knowledge spillover effects (international spillover effect). Within a cluster of closely related technologies, knowledge gained through deployment of one technology spills over to other technologies in the cluster (technology spillover effect). Parameters are estimated using historical data on the expansion of extant electricity technologies. Based on our results, if diffusion in developing regions relies heavily on earlier deployment in advanced regions, projections for certain technologies (e.g., bioenergy with carbon capture and storage) should be tempered. Our model illustrates that it can be globally optimal when innovative economies deploy some low-carbon technologies more than is locally optimal as it helps to accelerate diffusion (and learning effects) elsewhere. More generally, we demonstrate that by implementing a more empirically consistent diffusion formulation in an energy system optimization model, the traditionally crude-or nonexistent-representation of technology diffusion in energy-climate policy models can be significantly improved. This methodological improvement has important implications for the market adoption of low-carbon technologies. © 2015 Elsevier Inc..",Energy modeling; Integrated assessment; Knowledge spillover; Spatial diffusion; Technology diffusion; Technology spillover
"Kulczycka J., Kowalski Z., Smol M., Wirth H.",Evaluation of the recovery of Rare Earth Elements (REE) from phosphogypsum waste - Case study of the WIZÓW Chemical Plant (Poland),2016,"More than 5 million tons of apatite phosphogypsum, a waste derived from the production of phosphoric acid, have been tipped on the waste tip of the Wizów Chemical Plant (Poland). This waste contains Rare Earth Elements (REE) which are on the list of 'critical' raw materials in the EU and other countries. This paper presents an evaluation of the industrial waste management solutions in the Wizów plant. Technology has been developed that enables one to eliminate the landfilling of the phosphogypsum by converting the waste into commercial products: Anhydrite and REE concentrates (wasteless technology). In this study, the impacts of landfilling (1st variant) and the implementation of improvement - REE recovery (2nd variant) were explored taking into account both economic and environmental aspects. The two variants of waste management in Wizów were assessed using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method. The functional unit was 1 Mg of waste. Analyses were performed using the generic data ('input' and 'output') from the existing plant and from a technological plan proposed for REE recovery. The identification of factors affecting the environment was the basis for determining the environmental and developmental target and the basis for exploring modified technological solutions. The Eco-Indicator 99 (EI′99) method was applied. The evaluation of economic efficiency using the LCNPV method was based on calculations of technological plans, cost estimates and the market prices of raw materials. For validation, the results of exergy assessment were also proposed. The results of the analyses carried out using EI′99 indicate that disposal of waste has much less impact on the environment (Pt 4.58) than the proposed technology for processing it (Pt 8.28), even though in the new technology one takes into account the potential beneficial environmental impacts associated with the new materials: REE concentrates and anhydrite. The technology developed requires significant investment, but it can provide additional raw materials due to the possibility of REE recovery. There are considerable ecological benefits for plants generating phosphogypsum waste since the utilisation of all current production wastes would end phosphogypsum storage and turn the manufacturing process for extracting phosphoric acid into a low-waste production process, which is consistent with the targets of a circular economy. Moreover, the technology proposed in this paper should help to incentivise the global recovery of REE and facilitate the launching of new production activities due to the possibility of its application in other plants generating a large amount of phosphogypsum waste. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Langley P.,Crowdfunding in the United Kingdom: A cultural economy,2016,"Crowdfunding is a digital economy in which funds provided by large numbers of individuals (the crowd) are aggregated and distributed through online platforms to a range of actors and institutions. In the United Kingdom, crowdfunding is a particularly diverse and dynamic economy: the forms taken by funding now range from donations to business loans and the issue of equities by start-up enterprises, and recent rapid growth is concentrated in the financial market circuits of crowdfunding. This article analyzes the changing composition of the crowdfunding economy in the United Kingdom as a process of financial marketization and develops a sympathetic critical engagement with cultural economy scholarship on the geographies of money and finance. Consistent with previous cultural economy research into sociotechnical processes, the financial market circuits of crowdfunding are shown to be produced through the mobilization of economic theory and the enrollment of calculative market devices. When calling for a broadening of the existing analytical remit of cultural economy scholarship, however, emphasis is also placed on both regulation and governance and monetary valuations as constitutive and relational forces in the assembly of markets in the making. Regulation and governance are shown to deploy sovereign powers and techniques to territorialize, legitimize, and bolster the financial market circuits of crowdfunding. Money, meanwhile, is shown to play a dual role. While it certainly enables calculative and marketized valuations, money simultaneously creates scope for a multiplicity of values to be inscribed into its circulations such that the diversity of the crowdfunding economy persists and proliferates amidst financial marketization. © 2015 Clark University..",Crowdfunding; Finance; Marketization; Money; Peer-to-peer lending

A document analysis was done and a comparative study based on secondary data was elaborated. We can confirm that even a country from outside of the EU (Kazakhstan) can provide a better organized supply of digital services than an EU member state (Czech Republic) at least on the national level. According to the Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI) benchmarking, there are also significant discrepancies among national, regional and local services in the EU. The same phenomenon is also reported from transitional countries like Kazakhstan.",Czech Republic; DESI; Digital public services; E-government; EGDI; Electronic public services; European Union; Kazakhstan; Rural development

"Ardolino M., Saccani N., Perona M.",The rise of platform economy: A framework to describe multisided platforms,2016,"Several companies are facing challenges caused by increased competition and globalization. Thus, many businesses have started to exploit external competences and resources providing a place (generally virtual) in which different group of users are linked. This trend has led to the diffusion of businesses grounded upon multisided platforms (MSP) which have opened the new era of the so-called ""platform economy"". For example, Uber® is the most important taxi company in the world although it doesn't own any taxi, Facebook® provides thousands of applications and games developed by external developers, Airbnb® is one of the greatest accommodation provider but it doesn't own any estate, Alibaba® is among the most quoted retailers, but it does not have any warehouse This paper deals with the conceptualization of the phenomenon in object. The objective of the paper is threefold: 1) shed light on the main characteristics of MSPs (in particular those one grounded upon digital and internet technologies) and development of a definition in order to define the boundaries of the research; 2) identification of a typology aimed at categorizing the different businesses based on MSPs depending on the kind of interactions enabled and functions performed; 3) development of a framework aimed at describing the configuration variables of a business related to the platform economy.",Descriptive framework; Digital and internet technologies; Multisided platforms; Platform economy
Schwalbe U.,Antitrust compliance and abusive behaviour,2016,"The economic literature on antitrust compliance has concentrated on cartels as the most serious competition law violation. There are, however, infringements of competition law in form of an abuse of a dominant position which have not yet been considered in detail in the economics literature on antitrust compliance. This chapter examines how a comprehensive antitrust compliance programme should deal with abusive behaviour. In a first step, such a programme should determine whether the firm under consideration holds a dominant position. This requires the definition of the relevant antitrust market and the assessment of the competitive conditions in this market. If the firm is found to be dominant, the second step of a compliance programme has to ensure that no exploitative or exclusionary practices are employed. While for exploitative abuses screens similar to those in cartel cases can be used, no simple and reliable screens for exclusionary behaviour have been devised yet. Instead, the ""no economic sense"" test that has been suggested as an administrable rule to identify exclusionary behaviour could be applied. Roughly speaking, this test requires that a firm is able to demonstrate that the conduct under consideration is rational for the firm absent a tendency to eliminate competition. In the digital economy particular problems arise with respect to the definition of the relevant market and the determination of dominance. This is mainly due to the two-sided nature of most platform markets. Also, new forms of abusive behaviour can emerge in the digital economy that are related to the user data a platform has collected. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",Antitrust compliance; Digital economy; Exclusionary abuse; Exploitative abuse; Market definition; Market dominance; No economic sense test

For enterprises, this inevitable move means in particular: New technologies and changes in customer behavior and demands throw established business processes off track, opening entirely new possibilities and opportunities. Nowadays, digitization is often mentioned in the same breath with other buzzwords such as Mobile and Cloud Computing, Big Data, Business Intelligence, Internet of Things, Industry 4.0 or 3D Printing. However, this does not go far enough - there are more important drivers pushing the digitization and digital transformation for business organizations. Globalization is one of them, for instance, but also social changes with a new generation of customers - the Digital Natives. In this paper we illuminate the background of the digital transformation, and introduce the term Digital Master or 3D Master for the industrial purpose. We highlight the specific needs and expectations of the automotive industry. In a case study the application of Digital Master is shown in the production planning and quality assurance, based on a practical approach. © 2016 The authors and IOS Press.",3D Master; 3D PDF; Digital Master; Digital Transformation; Engineering Collaboration; Intelligent Document
Witjara E.,Enhancing digital business value through implementation of strategic threshold canvas: A model of value-pertaining strategy of transforming Telco,2016,"Today the world has been flourishing by the New Digital Economy. Among the symptoms is the fact that the Voice and Text Services provided by Telcos have been challenged heavily by the emerging of data-driven services that has been absorbed almost instantly by the crowd. This phenomenon amplifies the understanding that the business must run for the low-margin Digital Business and says farewell to high-margin Legacy Portfolios. The stakeholders would be satisfied if business brings profit and can shows some degrees of sustainability. The company is now need to secure their new Portfolio or creates another brand new one with manageable Margins and Values. Regarding the phenomenon, Telcos is now needed to define a model that could ensure Value-Pertaining-and-Leveraging stances especially in their Digital Portfolios meanwhile maintaining their cashcows. This research aimed to build such a model by exploring the effect of Product, Funding Management and Stakeholders Assurance to Business Valuation both directly or through ""Digital Death Valley"" by using Quantitative and Creative Problem Solving Method. While Quantitative method calculates the effects of variables and generate the foundation of the solution, the Creative Problem Solving methods explore alternatives that can be built to achieve the objective. Data sample collected from 30 Legal Entities of Telkom Group between 2013 - 2016. That is the period when early Digital transformation took place in Telkom Group. Quantitative run showed that Product is the most influencing factor to Digital Business Valuation followed by funding Management and Stakeholders Assurance. The Conclusion suggests that Digital Death Valley must be suppressed to the lowest level not only because it's direct impact to the profitability calculation but also affect long term Enterprise Value as Digital Death Valley comprises of Commitments, Concept Alteration and Partnership Strategy as Dimensions. By considering the relationship between variables a model called ""Strategic Threshold Canvas"" is suggested to oversee New Digital Business Portfolio initiatives that can be run by Business Analyst unit in Telcos. Essentially this model suggest a new Company Policy and Chain of Business Processes Standard that can be enacted to achieve Digital Glory.","""valley of death""; Business valuation; Digital product; Funding management; Stakeholder assurance"
"Baumers M., Dickens P., Tuck C., Hague R.","The cost of additive manufacturing: Machine productivity, economies of scale and technology-push",2016,"As part of the cosmos of digital fabrication technology, Additive Manufacturing (AM) systems are able to manufacture three-dimensional components and products directly from raw material and 3D design data. The layer-by-layer operating process of these systems does not require the use of tools, moulds or dies. Technology observers speculate that AM will have a profound economic impact on the manufacturing sector and indeed on wider society. By constructing a model of production cost for two different AM systems used commercially for the manufacture of end-use metal parts, Electron Beam Melting (EBM) and Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS), this paper performs an inter-process comparison of cost performance. High specific costs, measured at £2.39 and £6.18 per cm3 of material deposited respectively, are identified as a central impediment to more widespread technology adoption of such additive systems. The research demonstrates differing levels of system productivity, suggesting that the observed deposition rates are not sufficient for the adoption of EBM and DMLS in high volume manufacturing applications. Despite the absence of amortisable tooling costs, the analysis also reveals that economies of scale are achievable in AM. The results reached are further discussed in the light of the varying strategic requirements posed by the market-pull and technology-push modes of innovation which are both found in the AM industry. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",3D printing; Additive manufacturing; Digital fabrication; Economies of scale; Production cost; Productivity; Rapid manufacturing; Rapid prototyping

Gregory M.A.,The rationale for universal access to digital services,2016,"The regulated telecommunication markets found in many countries often include the social principle that telecommunications infrastructure should be reasonably available to all at fair and affordable rates. In Australia, this concept of universal service aims to ensure that all people, wherever they reside or carry on business, should have reasonable access, on an equitable basis, to standard telephone services and payphones. The hallmark of the universal service regime has been the reasonable availability of public payphones and the subsidised installation of telecommunications infrastructure at premises nationwide to provide standard telephone services. With the advent and ongoing evolution of broadband technologies a new need has arisen and that is for everyone to have reasonable access, on an equitable basis, to specified digital services, including egovernment services. This paper presents a position and identifies future research necessary to support the transition from the universal service regime to a universal access regime that enshrines the principle of ensuring that federal, state and local egovernment and other specified digital services are reasonably accessible to all, on an equitable basis, wherever they work or live. © 2015 Australian Journal of Telecommunications and the Digital Economy .",
"Tanniru M., Khuntia J.",Digital leadership through service computing: Agility driven by interconnected system and business architectures,2016,"Digitization to support services is an evolving phenomenon in a service-driven economy. While initiation and infusion of digitization in services may be relatively easy, the appropriation of value from such digitization is difficult. The digitization of services, represented as service objects, has to be modular and configurable to support business agility in order to assess viability and create value. While modularization of service objects is well established in existing literature, its ability to support business agility is not explored in the literature. In this study, we propose a concept of digital leadership that links service objects, represented in a service system architecture designed to support digital services, with various components of a business architecture for business agility in a changing business and technology landscape. We provide a definition of service objects to represent digital services, its associated characteristics, and how these service objects contribute to business agility.

"Li W., Liu K., Tang Y., Belitski M.",E-Leadership for SMEs in the digital age,2016,"Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of economy for many countries. With a business climate currently being transformed by digital technologies, an economy driven by SMEs can be an ideal catalyst to make the most of the potential of digital technologies. One of the main challenges that the leaders of SMEs face today is how business and information technology can be aligned in an optimal manner in their organizations to fully leverage the potential of digital technologies, where e-leadership plays an essential role. This chapter provides an insight into how e-leadership drives the successful alignment between business and IT by drawing organizational semiotics and business-IT alignment theory. This chapter provides a broad perspective on how SMEs can leverage technological potentials to maximize business competitiveness and growth. Furthermore empirical evidences from SMEs across Europe gathered on the basis of the theoretical model will also provide an insight on how SME decision makers perform effective e-leadership in driving effective business and IT alignment toward sustained competitiveness. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2017.",Business and IT alignment; E-Leadership; Organizational semiotics; Small and medium enterprises (SMEs)
Wahyuningtyas S.Y.,The online transportation network in Indonesia: A pendulum between the sharing economy and ex ante regulation,2016,"The prominent role of innovation in the emerging digital market in Indonesia presents new challenges for current competition law and policy. Traditionally reliant on market definition for the analysis, the present competition law may not yet have sufficiently taken innovation into consideration. In the competition policy area, while innovation has not taken a clear role in tailoring suitable regulations or approaches, markets have attempted to adapt themselves to the new changes in order to meet rising demand. The present state of policy is illustrated by the development of online transportation networks like those provided by Uber and GrabCar, services similar to those that have been traditionally off ered by taxi companies. While regulation asymmetry has been accused of not allowing a level playing field for conventional taxis versus online transportation networks, the concept of the sharing economy seems to address today’s policy approach in Indonesia, which favors ex ante regulation on public transportation service provision in the country. Th is paper examines the applicable regulations in the transportation network industry and discusses how competition policy might cope with this issue and in what cases competition law might deal with innovation brought by online transportation network in the public transportation industry in Indonesia. © 2016, SAGE Publications Ltd.

This book analyses how a particular group - creative knowledge workers - carry out their jobs and learn within it. Using empirical research from advertising and software development in Europe, Singapore and Japan, it develops a new conceptual framework to analyse the complexities of creative knowledge work. Focussing uniquely on the human element of working in the knowledge economy, it explores the real world of how people work in this emerging phenomenon and examines relationships between knowledge and creative dimensions to provide new frameworks for learning and working. It offers critical insights into how these workers apply their creative knowledge work capacities towards the production of innovative products and services, as well as using their creative abilities and knowledge to fashion both digital and tangible goods in the knowledge economy. Adding significantly to the on-going debate around knowledge work and creativity, this comprehensive examination will be of interest to researchers and educators in organisational learning, management and HRM and to anyone involved in devising ways to develop and support workers in lifelong and flexible creative work practices. © 2017 Sai Loo.",

"Schultz D., Chu G., Zhao B.",IMC in an emerging economy: The Chinese perspective,2016,"Integrated marketing communications (IMC) planning and implementation vary greatly by market and country. This study, based on the survey data compiled from 135 Chinese marketing executives, focuses on IMC in China’s emerging economy, with the goal of providing an outlook of IMC’s current development in China while uncovering factors in the country’s socioeconomic and business infrastructures that may cause IMC to deviate from the traditional Western model. The study also explores Chinese responses to the rising proliferation of digital media and its implications for IMC development. The study concludes that despite uneven business development and a current lack of training in IMC-related skills, IMC appears to be the inevitable course or the future of Chinese marketing communications. Due to factors unique to the Chinese business landscape, such as government-owned business structures, political nuances in marketing channel relationships, and uneven development of consumer culture, IMC in China will likely evolve differently than in the US. Survey respondents reveal that IMC is progressing much faster in local, privately owned firms than in their stateowned counterparts.

"Hariharan V., Thangavel N.","Business analytics - Enabling tool for micro, small & medium enterprises",2016,"Micro, large share of enterprises in most countries and are cornerstone of economies. They are major source of employment and income in most countries. However, they need to be competitive to survive and grow in the present era of liberalized and digital economy, making national boundaries almost irrelevant. Most of the SMEs are inward looking and not very competitive. They merely survive and sooner than later, seize to exist. One of the reasons for this lackluster performance is their inability to access and analyze right kind of information for decision making. Large corporates can afford to hire world class consultancy firms like McKinsey, Price Waterhouse Coopers, etc. whereas MSMEs find it almost impossible to afford them. These large firms get extra advantage, as the information generated by analysis of data collected using reliable research methodology, accurately serves the purpose of aiding them in making decisions under intricate situations. Also, data related to visitors of social media sites and navigation patterns on portals are widely used by large firms for predictive analysis. On the other hand, decision making at MSMEs is often based on ad-hoc methods or gut feeling making them more vulnerable to failures. Although, globalization has led to increased competition, it also offers opportunities for expansion of business, for firms with strategic and competitive strengths. Furthermore, the size of firm does not matter. In this era of digital economy, business success is strongly associated with up-to-date information and knowledge of markets, consumers and competitors acquired using scientifically proven research methods.

Mapping the ‘archipelago of disconnection’,2016,"For many people, internet access is an essential part of everyday economic, social, and political activities (c.f. Graham and Dutton 2014). Yet access to the internet is, and has always been, geographically concentrated (Graham, Hale, and Stephens 2012, 2011). As such, it is important to focus on the people and places that are largely left out of digital connectivity. This visualisation looks at these in terms of internet penetration (i.e. the share of their population that have “used the Internet (from any location) in the last 12 months” (source: UN 2015)). The map highlights all territories that either have internet penetration below 10%, or for which no data from the World Bank exists. A lack of data can exist for several reasons, for example: some of these territories are statistically grouped together with bigger entities, no data have been collected or inferred, or the territories lack widespread recognised statehood. The map ultimately highlights an archipelago of land whose population is mostly cut off from the internet. This Archipelago of Disconnection has its centre of gravity in Sub-Saharan Africa where 28 countries have internet penetration rates beneath the 10% threshold we applied. As the internet becomes ever more embedded into global economic flows (Malecki and Morisset 2011), to the inhabitation of urban spaces (Graham 2013), and to other facets of everyday life, those living in the Archipelago of Disconnection are largely barred from participating in the cultural, educational, political, and economic activities that it affords. © 2015 The Author(s).

"Krämer A., Kalka R.",How digital disruption changes pricing strategies and price models,2016,"The digitization of the economy leads to signifi cant changes in the way companies determine their prices. Technological changes (availability of the Internet, digitization of production, product innovations) basically infl uence the corporate environment, since the basis for pricing can be improved. Companies can collect and analyze more relevant information and hence optimize their prices. However, these causes accelerate competitive reactions. On the one hand, consumer behavior changes (more information is available online, search engines and price robots help to fi nd best offers); on the other hand, market structures become fragile (market entry barriers for new competitors are lowered, traditional products are cannibalized by digital products). Due to these factors, the pricing strategy must undergo a complete rethink. In addition, this has consequences for the types of pricing models applied in the digital age. In this context, this paper focuses on four pricing models. Firstly, the digitization makes it possible to offer products and services for free to the consumer (Facebook and Google are particularly profi table examples), while at the same time other sources of revenue streams (here: advertising revenue) are generated. Secondly, freemium models are especially popular with start-ups, which are also free of charge for a basic service, but for upgraded services (full range of features, no ads), users pay a fee. LinkedIn, Dropbox, and Spotify are prominent examples of this pricing model. Thirdly, subscription models have a strong boost. Since production costs drop when new business models are based on digitization, subscription models (like Netfl ix)-which have a long tradition- become more attractive, nowadays. Fourthly, pricing models with fl exible prices, which are dependent on demand and customer profi le, will be discussed. Dynamic pricing has a growing importance in online trading, but is also being applied more frequently in retail stores. This paper examines the implications of digitization on strategic and operational pricing decisions and shows examples from various industries (retail, media, music) and enterprises. The limits of technological changes are also discussed, mindful of both aspects the company perspective and the perspective (and perception) of the customer. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.",Big data; Dynamic pricing; Freemium; One-to-one pricing

Basu S.,"Digital divide, digital ethics, and E-government",2016,"Despite unprecedented increase in overall opulence, the contemporary world denies elementary freedoms to vast numbers - perhaps even the majority - of people. The important issue here is technological progress. Technology's influential relationship with society arguably reaches back to the beginning of human history. With regard to the history of technology, a number of authors believe that the development of human organisation from the Eolithic Age to the Information Age is directly related to the development of technology. As human dependency on technology has evolved, so have attitudes towards technology. In modern times, technology has tacitly been connected to the notion of progress. Arguably, in a global perspective adoption of a particular technology (it could be any technology) is a matter of affluence. Forerunner countries like the United States and western European countries are also leading nations with regard to economic performance. The more developed a country is in economic terms, the more the number of people who can afford and who need to rely on available technology in their daily business. In the last decade, we have seen that the wealthier economies have experienced a shift from industrial goods production to a service economy relying on the creation and processing of information and on knowledge workers who are skilled in the more advanced technology. © Bidit Dey, Karim Sorour and Raffaele Filieri 2016.",
Mihaylova I.,Could the recently enacted data localization requirements in Russia backfire?,2016,"In the wake of ex-NSA contractor Edward Snowden’s surveillance revelations to the global public, and despite an unimpeded cross-border data flow and knowledge transfer being a prerequisite for the development of the digital economy, governments around the world are increasingly tending to resort to mandatory local data storage and to restrictions and bans on data transfers in a rather drastic attempt to protect their citizens’ data security and privacy.This article discusses the legal and economic aspects of the recently enacted data localization requirements in the Russian Federation, as well as the consequences for costs, uncertainty, and the hampering of business activities that may arise if they are applied unaltered.The principal conclusion reached is that a less extreme solution that adheres to or builds upon the existing global practices and takes into account non-economic goals should be considered. © 2016 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands.",
"Araujo A., Urizar I.",4G Technology: The role of telecom carriers,2016,"This chapter focuses on the role of telecom carriers, analyzing operator strategies and performance in entering activities such as the entertainment industry, financial services or e-health. The chapter explores the evolution taken place in the development and deployment of the 4G long-term evolution technology, and the regulatory changes involved in such an evolution. It illustrates the large investments required in mobile technology which are driven by the whole of the ecosystem, which includes operators, software producers, hardware producers and contents, services and applications providers. The chapter tackles the regulation that has favoured or in some cases hindered the development of the telecom sector and the digital economy in Europe in general and in Spain in particular. It concludes by discussing how despite the large investments undertaken by mobile network operators, the growth in their revenues has stagnated in recent years, largely because their principal markets are saturated and on account of competition from virtual operators and the top firms also offering voice and data services using the networks deployed by the former. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",

"Wastell D.G., McMaster T., Kawalek P.",The rise of the phoenix: Methodological innovation as a discourse of renewal,2016,"Every 500 years (or 540, 1000, 1461, even 12,994, depending on the cultural context!), the legendary and beautifully plumaged Phoenix1 self-cremates in its nest of cinnamon twigs, rising again to embalm its predecessor in an egg of myrrh. Something of a Jungian archetype, the Phoenix symbolizes the universal cycle of birth, death and re-birth, figuring widely in religious and secular imagery, and in classical and popular culture. Renewal is the theme of this paper, but in the more mundane context of organizational resilience. Resilience is a cosmopolitan idea, encountered in many disparate domains, ranging from ecological policy (e.g. Folke et al., 2002) to child welfare (Newman and Blackburn, 2002). Although its definition is elusive (Cho et al., 2006) and its utility contested (even in seemingly well-entrenched terrain),2 the concept has gained recent prominence in the management literature, especially among the enthusiasts of ‘positive psychology’ (Luthans, 2002). Its proselytizers see resilience as an organizational capacity that can be designed and fostered as a protective shield against the apocalyptic turbulence and uncertainty of the contemporary business environment (Mallik, 1998; Hamel and Välikangas, 2003; Sheffi, 2005). Resilience is ‘the key skill for surviving in the multitude of changes as we move into the digital economy … [leaders] must cultivate the resilience of the workforce and create appropriate systems. If an organization does not create new strategies and systems that enhance organizational resilience, it will not adapt’ (Pulley, 1997). © Association for Information Technology Trust 2016.",

Based on a comprehensive literature review, the Delphi study and the survey questionnaire the critical success factors for and the level of state and local e-Government adoption in Poland were identified. Findings demonstrate that the factors are related to financial capabilities of government units, digital competences and awareness of government employees, quality of implemented information and communication technology, and information culture. It was also noticed that generally speaking the level of state e-Government adoption is not significantly different from the level of local e-Government adoption. Some differences appear mainly in information culture, i.e. government units at the state level are more advanced in creating the information culture leading to the e-Government adoption than local government units. © The Authors, 2016.",Adoption; Central and Eastern Europe; Critical success factors; E-Government; ICT; Level; Maturity; Poland; Transition economies
"Wisitpongphan N., Khampachua T.",Sufficient enterprise architecture components for public sector in Thailand,2016,"Despite several attempts and projects to decrease IT budget spending, e.g., establishing government cloud infrastructure (G-Cloud), distributing free software such as web conference and e-mail, providing nation-wide government information network (GIN), many agencies still could not take advantage of the benefit put forth by the Ministry of Information and Communication Technology (MICT). As a result, there are many redundant systems and infrastructures that have very low utilization rate. The ever-increasing budget request from each agency has prompted the government to carefully investigate the validity of each IT project prior to allocating the budget. However, without any knowledge about the existing IT landscape of each government agency, it is almost impossible to make reasonable budget approval. Hence, as of 2015 MICT has launched a roadmap which translates the government's digital economy policy into an action plan which includes establishing Enterprise Architecture (EA) that describes the fundamental IT landscape of each government agency. Not only will EA help the government in determining how much budget to allocate to each project, every agency will also learn from the EA what is missing and what needs to be fixed in order to succeed in providing useful public services. While adopting EA framework is a primary step toward preparing Thailand's service infrastructure, very little is known about how to implement EA for government agencies in Thailand. The famous frameworks such as Zachman or TOGAF are too abstract and time-consuming. Based on our experience in drafting EA for several government agencies and state enterprises in Thailand, we summarized our key findings in implementing EA and propose a Sufficient Enterprise Architecture Components that are suitable for all range of users, from the management level to the IT staffs. © The Authors, 2016.",Data exchange; Enterprise architecture; Public sector

Gusev D.,"The Russian payments scheme: Politics, innovation and the cash problem",2016,"This chapter presents a retrospective of politics, economics and user behaviour all fused together to propel the new formation of a local payment scheme in Russia. Developments accelerated rapidly between March 21, 2014, and the closing days of April 2015, when the first transactions through ‘a local switch’ were announced. These developments brought to light how issues of financial inclusion are all the more important, and help make a case for propelling new innovative payment services as vital for the future of financial inclusion. The chapter examines the pre-existing conditions of user demand, economical and technological requirements for the system to exist in the first place as well as the political agenda put forward to speed up the schedule to its rapid implementation.

Financial services are abstract and complex products necessitating professional expert help and confidence building in the sales process. The product evaluation and purchase require specialized tools. Itis highly susceptible to outside influence in decision making. Thus the role of sales persons in light of interplay or digital world and sophisticated product designs is at center stage now. We evaluate the role of sales persons and their learning orientation in achieving superior sales performance. We simultaneously test both the direct impact of learning orientation and indirect impact moderated by declarative knowledge (product knowledge) and procedural knowledge (salesmanship skills) on sales performanceusing a Structural Equation Model (SEM). Our findingssuggest that learning orientation alone does not suffice in achieving superior sales performance. It is necessary to acquire necessary product knowledge and salesmanship skills in achieving success in sales performance. It highlights the need of training and regular knowledge update in the knowledge intensive BFSI industry.

The researcher discusses the payment system to understand if Bitcoin would replace our cash-based society. The analysis is based on the technology S-curve and Schumpeter’s model of economic development. At present, there are problems hindering Bitcoin innovation to achieve a wide adoption as the innovation is not well received by the government central banks around the world. It is interesting to see that the swing of S-curves is not strong enough to cause a paradigm shift according to the Schumpeterian concept of creative destruction. The results have shown parallel S-curve trajectories of electronic money innovations signifying a move from a cash-based economy towards a less cash society. The study provides useful implications to support the diffusion of Bitcoin innovation. © Jarunee Wonglimpiyarat, 2016.",Bitcoin; Cashless; Darwinism; Digital money; Payment system

Such questions cannot be answered by traditional approaches. Thus another level of analysis is needed to complement the traditional approaches and to address future challenges. The first step in creating this new analysis was taken by Willem H. Vanderburg in 1985 with his pioneering work The Growth of Minds and Cultures. In this book, the first of a multi-volume series that includes Our Battle for the Human Spirit (2016), Vanderburg shows how the culture of a society underlies its science, technology, economy, social structure, political institutions, morality, religion, and art. As such, he seeks to build bridges not only between the ‘two cultures’ but between all the sciences in order to gain a deeper understanding of our age.

It argues that a concept of smart city should be more than the use of information technologies in local governments. The study and analysis of cities today requires a multidimensional and multifaceted concept and, therefore, multiple components. Some of these components are (1) public services, (2) city administration and management, (3) policies and other institutional arrangements, (4) governance and collaboration, (5) human capital and creativity, (6) knowledge economy and pro-business environment, (7) built environment and city infrastructure, (8) natural environment and ecological sustainability, (9) ICT and other technologies, and (10) data and information. In addition, the authors refer to smartness as public sector innovation in urban contexts. A comprehensive view of a smart city should encompass government innovation in management and policy as well as technology and must acknowledge how the context of a city shapes the data and the technological, organizational, and policy aspects of a specific initiative.

"Panmuang M., Porrawatpreyakorn N.",Factors influencing acceptance of and benefit realization from information systems in Thai State enterprises,2016,"Information Systems (ISs) enable work collaboration in organizations which potentially lead to IS acceptance and later benefit realization. However, acceptance of and benefit realization from ISs cannot be gained effectively, especially in Thai state enterprises. This paper thus scrutinizes influential factors using questionnaires, in-depth interviews, and observation. Data was collected from eight Thai state enterprises during September-December 2015. The questionnaire result by multiple regression analysis reveals that individual, satisfaction, perception, and social influence allow prediction of IS acceptance with 94.70% accuracy and correlation coefficient of 0.973. Besides, satisfaction and perception allow prediction of benefit realization from ISs with 82.60% accuracy and correlation coefficient of 0.909; while, IS acceptance allows prediction of benefit realization from ISs with 38.20% accuracy and correlation coefficient of 0.620. Besides, the interview result reveals 7 factors influencing acceptance of and benefit realization from ISs which include age, education, work experience, governmental policy, organizational policy, organizational culture, public service administration and operational agility. All of the identified factors have been used to design a framework which helps to cultivate benefit realization and drive sustainable growth of organizational and eventually national economies. © The Authors, 2016.",Benefit realization; Factors; Information system acceptance; State enterprise
"Rokka J., Canniford R.",Heterotopian selfies: how social media destabilizes brand assemblages,2016,"Purpose: Digital technologies are changing the ways in which the meanings and identity of both consumers and brands are constructed. This research aims to extend knowledge of how consumer-made “selfie” images shared in social media might contribute to the destabilization of brands as assemblages. Design/methodology/approach: Insights are drawn from a critical visual content analysis of three popular champagne brand accounts and consumer-made selfies featuring these brands in Instagram. Findings: This study shows how brands and branded selves intersect through “heterotopian selfie practices”. Accentuated by the rise of attention economy and “consumer microcelebrity”, the authors argue that these proliferating selfie images can destabilize spatial, temporal, symbolic and material properties of brand assemblages. Practical implications: The implications include a consideration of how selfie practices engender new challenges for brand design and brand management. Originality/value: This study illustrates how a brand assemblage approach can guide investigations of brands at multiple scales of analysis. In particular, this paper extends knowledge of visual brand-related user-generated content in terms of how consumers express, visualize and share selfies and how the heterotopian quality of this sharing consequently shapes brand assemblages. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Brand assemblage; Branding; Champagne; Heterotopia; Selfie; Visual content analysis

It has been created with a strong social purpose to unlock idle skills and resources within communities, and to encourage the growth of a social economy. ebarts are used in a secure, mobile-based marketplace for trading goods and services, and generate value from exchange. In this paper, we discuss the user-centred design process we have employed to build an ebarts marketplace platform, focusing on people’s expectations for creating and using ebarts. Our design reflects our findings that people are geared by a want to reduce waste and generate value from possessions, skills and time that would otherwise be wasted. Correlating people’s responses from focus groups indicates that social entrepreneurship can be nurtured by such marketplaces, and that there is need for a space to be created in society for individuals to engage their entrepreneurial creativity for their own benefit as well as directly affecting their communities. Finally, based on our development of ebarts we present a framework with which to understand the varieties of outcomes an ebarts-based marketplace can achieve and how it can strategically exploit the changes such marketplaces may bring. © The Author(s) 2016.",
"Koç H., Sandkuhl K., Fellmann M.",Towards a flexible solution in knowledge-based service organizations: Capability as a service,2016,"To improve their chances of survival, enterprises need to cope with the challenges caused by today’s dynamic markets, regulations, customer demands, novel technologies, etc. The shift towards a service-oriented economy as underlined by the concept of Service-Dominant (S-D) Logic is gaining traction within the Service Science community and industry. This shift towards service-dominated business models makes it even more important for enterprises to be agile to meet the rapidly changing customer demands. This demand for agility is reinforced in the context of knowledge-based service organizations (KBSOs), for which flexible service provision is a fundamental requirement. Against this background, we argue that the capability-driven design may provide the KBSOs the required degree of flexibility. Towards this goal, we present an approach for the capability-driven design of enterprises. More precisely, our contributions are (i) the introduction of a capability-based paradigm that contributes to the design of flexible services in KBSOs, (ii) an architecture of our service design and deployment environment and (iii) a demonstration of using our approach based on a real-world use case from an organization in the utilities industry.

Christensen C.,"WikiLeaks and ""indirect"" media reform",2016,"The relatively short history of WikiLeaks (2006-2014) has offered numerous examples of how issues central to media reform (political economy, regulation, ownership, law) emerge from their leaks and activities. As I note, WikiLeaks is not a media reform group nor, for the most part, have WikiLeaks activities targeted media organizations or media-related policy. In terms of reform strategy, WikiLeaks-as perhaps the only whistleblowing site known across a broad crosssection of the global population-finds itself in an unusual, somewhat isolated position. My chapter on WikiLeaks is unlike the others in this book as it frames debates on media reform as emerging as a by-product of the actions of WikiLeaks, rather than addressing specific strategies for reform. I would argue that, given the nature of its activities, coalition-building around a single organization such as WikiLeaks would be, at best, difficult. However, other whistleblowing sites such as GlobalLeaks.org are starting to emerge, and larger-scale freedom of speech organizations such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), and Article 19 are evolving into a clear cluster of ""digital defenders"" advocating for the rights of whistle-blowers and users alike, and, thus, offer a valuable node for advocating media reform in relation to whistleblowing, transparency, and journalism. © 2016 Fordham University Press.

"Farrokhnia F., Richards C.","E-commerce products under the world trade organization agreements: Goods, services, both or neither?",2016,"E-commerce is becoming an increasingly important focus of the international trade. Dealing with the virtual nature of e-commerce to create a borderless global economy requires the involvement of the World Trade Organization (WTO) as the only international organization regulating global trade between nations. However, the WTO has struggled in its efforts to address the various uncertainties of classification applied to e-commerce products (hereinafter ‘Classification’) under its existing Agreements (e.g. General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS)). This article investigates how a comprehensive approach is needed to address foundational Classification challenges. Using the key tools of the grounded theory method, this article analyses all the WTO Members’ discussions (1998-2014) related to the Classification issue. It does so as a basis for critiquing the WTO’s approach to addressing this challenge. It argues e-commerce products are both or neither goods or services. Extending the territorial and geographical notions created for traditional trade to the virtual nature of digital world is simply inadequate and fails to appropriately draw a certain line between traditional trade and existing as well as emerging e-commerce products. On this basis this article provides an outline of the distinct and more integrated approach needed. © 2016 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands.",
"Day J.W., Hall C.",America’s most sustainable cities and regions: Surviving the 21st century megatrends,2016,"This book takes you on a unique journey through American history, taking time to consider the forces that shaped the development of various cities and regions, and arrives at an unexpected conclusion regarding sustainability. From the American Dream to globalization to the digital and information revolutions, we assume that humans have taken control of our collective destinies in spite of potholes in the road such as the Great Recession of 2007-2009. However, these attitudes were formed during a unique 100-year period of human history in which a large but finite supply of fossil fuels was tapped to feed our economic and innovation engine. Today, at the peak of the Oil Age, the horizon looks different. Cities such as Los Angeles, Phoenix and Las Vegas are situated where water and other vital ecological services are scarce, and the enormous flows of resources and energy that were needed to create the megalopolises of the 20th century will prove unsustainable. Climate change is a reality, and regional impacts will become increasingly severe. Economies such as Las Vegas, which are dependent on discretionary income and buffeted by climate change, are already suffering the fate of the proverbial canary in the coal mine. Finite resources will mean profound changes for society in general and the energy-intensive lifestyles of the US and Canada in particular. But not all regions are equally vulnerable to these 21st-century megatrends. Are you ready to look beyond “America’s Most Livable Cities” to the critical factors that will determine the sustainability of your municipality and region? Find out where your city or region ranks according to the forces that will impact our lives in the next years and decades. Find out how: ·resource availability and ecological services shaped the modern landscape ·emerging megatrends will make cities and regions more or less livable in the new century ·your city or region ranks on a “sustainability” map of the United States ·urban metabolism puts large cities at particular risk ·sustainability factors will favor economic solutions at a local, rather than global, level ·these principles apply to industrial economies and countries globally. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016.",

Barrett B.,Chameleon effect of virtual enterprises in challenging economic times and repositioning economic pursuits,2016,"As more global economies have been expanding and contracting due to economic pressures, societal changes, and leadership in general, more businesses externally have been attempting entry into various economically, challenged markets, but with limited access or success. While there may be a variety of reasons preventing or limiting their success, the logistics of any venture may be one key to understanding why some entities are becoming more successful or creative in their marketing strategies and implement. In particular, as the digital divide becomes not only more of a social, but yet business, issue for debate among the various internal and external stakeholders, a certain degree of innovation and creativity has been necessary for various organization to reposition their leadership approach to various markets. Specifically, as more countries consider changes in their business and educational approaches, they are looking towards the best practices of other countries as a way of spearheading changings in their economics, especially in transforming their business and educational endeavors and potential opportunities for their own people. However, this leads to the question of how certain companies are changing their leadership approach and adapting to these various new environments, metaphorically speaking, as well as economic and educationally examining, how this chameleon effect can bring about new partnerships and lasting brand name marketing into new economic markets. In terms of various virtual enterprises, many academic institutions are reaching out to new markets in order to compete with the various competitors in their industry in order to secure a strong foothold the global educational community, develop new markets, and to reposition their leadership image in the educational industry as a more global leader. Consequently, many of these colleges and education are transforming their traditional marketing strategies to the use of a different approach to attract a new breed off adult leaders by offering free Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) to entice potential students to try out courses to see if they have an interest and learning potential as a way of beta testing the global waters. Further, if there is sufficient interest in any global local, it is then the role and function of the current virtual leadership to make the necessary contacts and help facilitating the potential partnership between the virtual educational enterprise and new global market. While simplistic in its potential business design and marketing approach, this is only a stepping stone as to the unlimited potential that new virtual leaders can make on the global market, whereas, they may be able to help reposition their organization from not only the traditional way of doing business, but now on a more global scale.",Leadership; Marketing; Strategic partnership; Virtual learning; Virtual management

Hossain A.,Evolution of Mutual Knowledge-Based Economy in Regional Integration: An Experience from the Cooperation Council of Arab States of the Gulf,2015,"The purpose of this paper is to provide comparative analyses of the indicators of knowledge-based economy (KBE) in the Cooperation Council of Arab States of the Gulf (GCC) contribute to improve such indicators in one member taking comparative advantages from another member country and vice versa. Furthermore, the study also intends to develop a model of integrating the indicators of KBE in the GCC integration process and the spiral of knowledge conversion model. The paper applies comparative analyses of the indicators of KBE in the GCC. The study applied 26 indicators in five categories. Such categories include: education/talent, economic and institutional regime, innovation, digital economy, and globalization. This study performs analysis of variance (ANOVA) to calculate standard deviation, mean, and confidence interval. The study also carries out ANOVA to compare between and within countries. The required secondary data are obtained from publications, country reports, and existing reports of the international organizations. The ANOVA reveals significant differences in almost all the indicators among the member countries in the GCC. As a result, most of the indicators of KBE outperform in one member country compared to another. Such phenomenon provides GCC countries with an opportunity to gain comparative advantages of one member’s outperforming indicators to improve another member’s poor performing indicators and vice versa considering the privileges of the “GCC Common Market”. The study revealed that the GCC should forward localized and collective microdynamics in education, research, and innovation will contribute to understanding and formulating macrodynamics that positively affect local community, sectors, institutions, and governance arrangements improving the sector-specific indicator of KBE.

"Counted A.V., Arawole J.O.","‘We are connected, but constrained’: internet inequality and the challenges of millennials in Africa as actors in innovation",2015,"One of the biggest news stories in the past decade has been the increasing impact of the internet and information technology on young people, from first-generation mission countries in North America and Western Europe to the global south—particularly in Africa. This advancement has fueled the growth of a “connected” and “plugged in” cohort of young people known as millennials, who are utilizing this medium to improve their social status and create potential for economic and professional growth. However, while the Internet has created opportunities for growth and development on the continent, many online platforms and services continue to restrict full access to certain parts of the global south. Hence, in some African countries, for example, opportunities for scaling innovation and development can be very difficult to access. Consequently, as our daily activities sync with technology, concerns over access to the Internet economy and the undue restrictions over internet services persist. Using the storytelling research methodology, this paper seeks to highlight why geo-restrictions and regional lockouts over internet-related services seem to be a major challenge for millennials in Africa, who are actors in innovation by virtue of their contribution to the growth of the internet technology. We argue that this enforced regional lockout not only deflates the productivity and creativity of African millennials, but also points to a functionalist view of internet inequality constituted through the ""divides"" of accessibility, censored participation, and acceptability in the internet economy. Understanding the staggering nature of this problem would require telling the stories of young internet entrepreneurs and innovators in Africa, who continue to be marginalized while investing and contributing to the internet economy. © 2016, Counted and Arawole.",African millennials; Digital development; Internet inequality; Internet usage policy; Narrative inquiry; Storytelling; Usage access

Aaronson S.,"Why Trade Agreements are not Setting Information Free: The Lost History and Reinvigorated Debate over Cross-Border Data Flows, Human Rights, and National Security",2015,"Herein, we examine how the United States and the European Union use trade agreements to advance the free flow of information and to promote digital rights online. In the 1980s and 1990s, after US policymakers tried to include language governing the free flow of information in trade agreements, other nations feared a threat to their sovereignty and their ability to restrict cross-border data flows in the interest of privacy or national security. In the twenty-first century, again many states have not responded positively to US and EU efforts to facilitate the free flow of information. They worry that the US dominates both the Internet economy and Internet governance in ways that benefit its interests. After the Snowden allegations, many states adopted strategies that restricted rather than enhanced the free flow of information. Without deliberate intent, efforts to set information free through trade liberalization may be making the Internet less free. Finally, the two trade giants are not fully in agreement on Internet freedom, but neither has linked policies to promote the free flow of information with policies to advance digital rights. Moreover, they do not agree as to when restrictions on information are necessary and when they are protectionist. Copyright © Susan Aaronson 2015.",

"Behling N., Williams M.C., Managi S.",Fuel cells and the hydrogen revolution: Analysis of a strategic plan in Japan,2015,"Japan may be the least likely country to start a revolution, but its new energy policy, if implemented successfully, will revolutionize Japan's economy, society, and energy infrastructure. The new energy policy calls for the creation of a ""hydrogen society"" in which citizens will use hydrogen as their primary energy source. Hydrogen fuel would be produced from renewable sources and used to generate electricity at home and to power vehicles via fuel cells. The policy came into force in April 2015 and will guide Japan's energy development for the next 25 years and perhaps beyond. The new policy is a determined response to the twin disasters faced on March 11, 2011, when Japan was struck by a Magnitude 9 earthquake and then a catastrophic tsunami, which devastated Japan's economy, energy security, and environmental well-being. The new energy policy would substantially reduce Japan's dependence on nuclear power as well as oil and gas-fired thermal power plants and would greatly strengthen the development of fuel cell systems that use hydrogen. Implemented in three broad phases over several decades, the policy would promote the development of fuel cells that are less costly, more efficient, and more durable, and it would develop hydrogen production, storage, and transport as well as fueling systems to support the widespread use of fuel cells. Over the long term, the hydrogen society could be integrated into Japan's concept of a ""smart community"" that uses digital technologies and information and communication technologies to more efficiently generate and regulate the use of power. This paper examines how Japan laid the policy and legal framework in the 1990s to promote fuel cell and hydrogen development, compares Japan's investment and policy strategies to those in the United States and the European Union, identifies the challenges Japan will face in broadly establishing a hydrogen society, assesses the potential economic benefits it might enjoy if the hydrogen society policy succeeds, and recommends that the new energy policy be more fully integrated with other initiatives to promote economic growth, more efficient communities, and a cleaner environment. © 2015 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland.",Energy; Fuel cell; H50; Hydrogen; Japan; L10; O31; Policy; Q42
"Barrell K., Lemmens W.",The future of digital services delivery embracing co-dependency for growth of the national digital economy,2015,"Australia has set a strong ambition to capture opportunities presented by the emerging digital economy. While much discussion has focussed on the significant investment being made in broadband infrastructure, it is important to recognise that a range of other factors will also impact Australia's ability to achieve its vision of a dynamic digital market. Not least will be the requirement for the highest levels of satisfaction across a complex service delivery environment encompassing retail and business consumers, today's retail and wholesale service providers, and early phase digital content providers as well as the full range of future digital application services providers. Realising Australia's ambition for the digital economy transcends access network architecture and technology considerations, while highlighting the complex array of technology, process and systems components required to deliver digital services in the global marketplace. Successfully harnessing this diverse set of contributors is fundamental to ensuring Australia develops an effective service delivery ecosystem to underpin its digital future. This paper makes the case for industry to turn its attention to the operational market structure and processes that will support this future environment, together with the key multiparty relationships and interdependencies that will underpin the required high levels of user experience and Australia's ultimate success.",
Brown T.,The digital galactic complex,2015,"This Brief discusses the current policy environment in which the United States space program operates and proposes an industry-government partnership as a long-term policy solution. Since the Reagan administration, American space policy has increasingly sought to involve private sector operators for space. The culmination of this trend has been the Obama administrations policy of private sector transportation of crew and cargo to the International Space Station on behalf of NASA. This book proposes that future administrations extend this policy to other areas of space, including energy, in orbit manufacturing, asteroid mining, and the exploration of the Moon and Mars. The book further demonstrates how these activities can stabilize the global political system and lead to a dramatic increase in global economic growth. Finally, the book addresses one of the most important and critical issues currently facing humanitythe need for a viable, baseload, and unlimited supply of totally clean energy. An extremely cogent analysis of the interrelationship between space activity and the terrestrial economy, this book showcases the political and economic potential of the medium of space and adds greatly to the existing literature in the field. This book will be of interest to students of political science and strategic studies as well as members of the military, government space agencies, and the international aerospace industry. © The Author(s) 2016.

Bughin J.,Google searches and twitter mood: nowcasting telecom sales performance,2015,"The web currently carries vast amounts of information as to what consumers search for, comment on, and purchase in the real economy. This paper leverages a mash-up of online Google search queries and of social media comments (from Twitter, Facebook and other blogs) to “nowcast” the product sales evolution of the major telecom companies in Belgium. A few findings stand out. With an Error Correction Mechanism (ECM) model of sales dynamics, a co-integration relationship prevails between social media valence (respectively, between search query) and telecom operators’ sales for both internet and digital television access provision (respectively, for fixed telephony provision). Elasticity estimates on sales are relatively larger for valence than for search queries. The ECM model with nowcasting variables improves telecom sales forecasts by about 25 % versus a naïve autoregressive sales model. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Google trends; Nowcasting; Social media
"Dadwal S.S., Hassan A.",The augmented reality marketing: A merger of marketing and technology in tourism,2015,"This chapter elaborates on augmented reality marketing (ARM) as a digital marketing campaign and a strategic trend in tourism and hospitality. The computer assisted augmenting of perception by means of additional interactive information levels in real time is known as augmented reality. Augmented reality marketing is a constructed worldview on a device with blend of reality and added or augmented themes interacting with five sense organs and experiences. The systems and approaches of marketing are integrating with technological applications in almost all sectors of economies and in all phases of a business's value delivery network. Trends in service sector marketing provide opportunities in generating technology led tourism marketing campaigns. Also, the adoption, relevance and significance of technology in tourism and hospitality value delivery network can hardly be ignored. Many factors are propelling the functionalities of diverse actors in tourism. This paper explores the use of technology at various phases of tourism and hospitality marketing, along with the role of technology in enhancing consumer experience and value addition. It further supports the view that technology is aiding in faster diffusion of tourism products, relates destinations or attractions and thus benefiting the entire society. The augmented reality in marketing can create effective and enjoyable interactive experience by engaging the customer through a rich and rewarding experience of virtually plus reality. Such a tool has real potential in marketing in tourism and hospitality sector. Thus, this study discusses the ARM as a promising trend in tourism and hospitality and how this will meet future needs of tourism and hospitality products or offerings. © 2015, IGI Global.

The article deals specifically with understanding how digital and creative skills in the UK are embedded across industries, or are concentrated in creative sub-sectors. Furthermore, it explores the role that these graduates play in each of the different sectors and their financial rewards. Findings suggest that digital technology graduates tend to concentrate in the software and gaming sub-sector of the creative industries, but also are likely to be in embedded creative jobs outside of the creative industries.

"Fleischmann K., Daniel R.",The rise of the embedded designer in the creative industries,2015,"Work practices in the creative industries have changed significantly since the turn of the twenty-first century. The design profession in particular has been influenced by rapidly emerging digital media practices and processes. While the design sector remains a significant source of employment, in recent years, there has been considerable growth in the number of designers working – or ‘embedded’ – in other sectors of the economy. The extent to which tertiary curricula cater for this shift in work practices and employment types is not well known. In this article, we report on original research on the preferred work destinations of a cohort of design students. This research was supplemented by a set of interviews with a small group of embedded designers in order to gain insights into the characteristics of embedded positions. Our research reveals that an embedded design position, while not well understood by undergraduate students, is a significant career path and one that should receive greater attention in undergraduate design curricula. We conclude that greater emphasis should be placed on assisting embedded designers to maintain creative networks that support them in what is a relatively isolated creative role. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",communication design; creative industries; design education; embedded creative; graphic design
"Park S.R., Choi D.Y., Hong P.",Club convergence and factors of digital divide across countries,2015,"By examining the digital divide phenomenon among 108 countries, this paper attempts to develop a greater understanding of the factors that can foster a more creative global economy. As part of this investigation, a new ICT development index is constructed using principal component analysis and the inclusion of conventional ICT development indicators. Using Phillips and Sul's (2007) log t convergence test, we found that the level of digitalization convergence that exists among the 108 countries analyzed can be categorized into three different groupings. Within these groups, we found that the 1st group which contains the highest level of convergence showed the slowest speed of convergence, while the results for the 3rd group displayed the lowest convergence level with the highest speed of convergence among its members in digitalization. This study also identified the factors that drive a country's digitalization convergence level, these included: per capita GDP, tertiary education entrance rate, the ratio of urban population, and the share of service trade in GDP. With the exception of urban population, which showed results to the contrary, all of these factors were proven to raise a country's likelihood to belong to a higher convergence level. As for policy measures that can be used to foster a creative economy, marginal effect analysis identifies the tertiary education entrance rate as being the most effective means for raising the digitalization convergence level. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Creative economy; Digital divide; Digitalization; ICT; Log t club convergence test

Faugère C.,Think Tank-Back to the Future: A NanoGold Standard Proposal,2015,"Gold and other precious metals have acted as a medium for economic exchange for millennia, and currencies based on gold have always had a certain attraction. Because gold is an exhaustible, nonrenewable resource, however, many economists view the gold standard, where the prices of currencies are fixed in terms of a specified amount of gold, as a recipe for economic depression in the long term. An exploration of a proposal to return to a gold standard based on NanoGold examines the practical implications of backing paper currency with minute quantities of gold. Advances in digital technology make it possible for NanoGold particles to serve as a viable medium of exchange-provided people can measure it accurately, validate its tangibility in transactions, and accept it as a new social norm. The undesirable effects of the private holding of gold flooding the economy can be avoided if central banks can enforce a minting monopoly on NanoGold particles. If these conditions are met, it might be possible that paper money will have a true backing and monetary policy can generate price stability and postpone deflation to an infinitely distant future. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",
Watkins E.,Literacy work in the reign of human capital,2015,"In recent years, a number of books in the field of literacy research have addressed the experiences of literacy users or the multiple processes of learning literacy skills in a rapidly changing technological environment. In contrast to these studies, this book addresses the subjects of literacy. In other words, it is about how literacy workers are subjected to the relations between new forms of labor and the concept of human capital as a dominant economic structure in the United States. It is about how literacies become forms of value producing labor in everyday life both within and beyond the workplace itself. As Evan Watkins shows, apprehending the meaning of literacy work requires an understanding of how literacies have changed in relation to not only technology but also to labor, capital, and economics. The emergence of new literacies has produced considerable debate over basic definitions as well as the complexities of gain and loss. At the same time, the visibility of these debates between advocates of old versus new literacies has obscured the development of more fundamental changes. Most significantly, Watkins argues, it is no longer possible to represent human capital solely as the kind of long-term resource that Gary Becker and other neoclassical economists have defined. Like corporate inventory and business management practices, human capital-labor-now also appears in a ""just-in-time"" form, as if a power of action on the occasion rather than a capital asset in reserve. Just-in-time human capital valorizes the expansion of choice, but it depends absolutely on the invisible literacy work consigned to the peripheries of concentrated human capital. In an economy wherein peoples' attention begins to eclipse information as a primary commodity, a small number of choices appear with an immensely magnified intensity while most others disappear entirely. As Literacy Work in the Reign of Human Capital deftly illustrates, the concentration of human labor in the digital age reinforces and extends a class division of winners on the inside of technological innovation and losers everywhere else. © 2015 Fordham University Press.

Chipembele M.,The future of library services in the digital economy: A case study of the copperbelt university library,2015,"Libraries may be on the verge of a revolutionary phase of integrating technology in all their services in order for them to become effective information providers in the digital economy. In much of the literature on the potential of ICTs in academic libraries, it is argued that advancements in ICTs are changing the way people are accessing and using information. Hence, integration of ICTs in library services is necessary if libraries are to effectively provide information at anytime and anywhere. This chapter seeks to address this issue with a focus on the Copperbelt University library in Kitwe, Zambia. The chapter reviews various similar sources that looked at technology and its impact on library services. Additionally, in the African context, there has been massive adoption of Internet-enabled technologies. For example many people have smart phones such as Blackberries, Samsung, Nokia and Apple iPhones, which enable them access Internet ubiquitously. The emergence of these technologies and their abilities to provide tailor made applications for pervasive access to information resources entails that even library content may now be provided on electronic platforms. Whereas the rest of the world has done a substantial amount towards electronic library systems, not much has been done in Africa. Despite such challenges, libraries are taking steps in modernizing their services in an effort to fully satisfy the ever-changing needs of their information users. Additionally, recommendations on what libraries ought to do in order for them to bridge the widening gap in terms of how people are accessing and using information are given. © 2015, IGI Global.

Kwami J.D.,"Gender, entrepreneurship, and informal markets in Africa: Understanding how ghanaian women traders self-organize with digital tools",2015,"Mainstream scholarship on entrepreneurship focuses on firms in the global north as the dominant paradigm, neglecting potential lessons to be found in the informal sector, in the global south, particularly in Africa, and among women. Local entrepreneurship practices present a valuable case study for understanding the nature of entrepreneurship in emerging economies and their contribution to social and economic development. Drawing on ethnographic data, this chapter examines gender and information and communication technology use in the Ghanaian marketplace. Market women's entrepreneurship is influenced by social capital derived from social networks drawn from strong community ties. The study found that ICTs such as mobile phone, while gendered, are central to organizing and managing these micro-enterprises.

"Lane K.E., Lemoine P., Tinney T.M., Richardson M.D.",Modify and adapt: Global higher education in a changing economy,2015,"The combinations of global networking and digital delivery have intense repercussions for higher education administrators who confront a magnitude of opportunities and challenges as the result of the digital revolution. Much of the reaction to technological change comes from those with a vested interest in either wholesale change or maintaining the status quo. Taking the resilience metaphor from ecology, the authors propose a framework for analyzing an institution's ability to adapt to digital challenges. To compete in today's economic environment, higher education institutions must become more adaptive, responding more quickly to changing expectations from society, politicians and customers. The non-linear approach to problem-solving evident in higher education and society in general, reflects a need to be more flexible, adaptive to alternative techniques and willing to invest in a new culture designed to acquire knowledge rather than specific solutions. This level of organizational flexibility and responsiveness fuels university performance. In the globally competitive and commercialized start to the 21st Century there has been a considerable increase in the demands for higher education institutions to provide additional global access, and increase opportunities while simultaneously reducing budgets. Globalization and technology have introduced critical alterations to higher education institutions. The context of education has become dynamic, energetic, and economically driven. The emerging technologies have rapidly turned knowledge to power. In this context knowledge is viewed as a commodity that can be managed (bought and sold) while being a vibrant source of social activity and learning. © 2015, IGI Global. All rights reserved.",

The conditions required for this to happen are investigated and the impact on social welfare is discussed.

We conducted a conjoint study, comprising more than 3000 participants, to investigate consumers’ data sharing sensitivities along six dimensions of context and across ten private and public sectors covering the whole economy. We find that nearly all consumers (99.9 % of our sample) want to share personal data with organizations if the benefits and terms suffice their needs. Second, we show that consumers clearly discriminate between organizations from various industry sectors when it comes to their willingness to share their data. Third, we find that context of sharing personal data is more important in the consumers’ decision making than the actual data itself. Further, we provide evidence that the right to be forgotten can significantly increase consumers’ willingness to share their data. © 2015, Institute of Information Management, University of St. Gallen.",Conjoint; Data protection; Digital identity; Personal data; Privacy
Runciman D.,Digital politics: Why progressives need to shape rather than merely exploit the digital economy,2015,"The IT revolution is transforming politics and opening up a new dimension of inequality. A progressive political party needs to understand this complicated new terrain, and to think of ways to get on the right side of it. At the moment it is an economy being driven almost entirely by the vast corporate monoliths of the digital age. The era of tech politics 2.0 was initiated by the 2008 Obama campaign, which appeared to demonstrate the great potential of social media when used creatively, particularly in terms of reaching young or otherwise disengaged voters. The digital age has encouraged politicians to consider this question beyond their remit, since individuals now have so many leisure options available to them. But the technology that creates the options also squeezes the time in which we are able to make best use of them. While today's politicians cannot intervene in traditional social democratic ways to correct for this, surely social democrats should be able to persuade people that they are at least worrying about it. The pace of change is only going to accelerate. The future does not belong to the party that tries to reverse or to second-guess those changes, because no one can. It belongs to the party that can make those changes work in the interests of more people than are benefitting from them at present.",
"Kamprath M., Mietzner D.",The impact of sectoral changes on individual competences: A reflective scenario-based approach in the creative industries,2015,"Many foresight studies concentrate on technological foresight and its impact at the organizational level. However, often these studies overlook the soft factor of employee competences which is critical to adopting technological and organizational changes and to developing the necessary innovation capabilities. This study investigates the theoretical and methodological underdeveloped relationship between technological innovation and social initiated change and the impact on individual competences in a dynamic sector. The setting of our study is the turbulent creative industries as a whole, where creative and artistic expression merges with changing technological progress. In a scenario study we mainly conducted in 2010, we developed a scenario model for competences to combine individual competences with a scenario approach to investigate how competences are important to the sector shift or need to be enhanced in the future. We use primary qualitative data from expert interviews and workshops and secondary data from industry reports to identify thirty-seven influence factors. An influence matrix calculation and a cluster analysis are used to project three different scenarios presenting how future developments of the creative industries will influence the competences needed for creative occupations. Now, five years later, we reflect the accuracy of the developed scenarios via a comparison of today's situation with the situation in the scenarios. We discuss theoretical contributions for the foresight literature and practical implementations for the future of work in general, and in particular for the creative industries case. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Competences; Convergence; Creative economy; Creative industries; Digital; Entertainment; Foresight; Futures studies; Human capital resource; Media; Microfoundations; Scenario; Skills; Strategic human resources; Technological impact; Work
"Wallin A., Harjumaa M., Pussinen P., Isomursu M.",Challenges of new service development: Case video-supported home care service,2015,"In all developed economies, there is a mounting demand for effective solutions to elderly care stemming from an aging population and the high cost of resources needed. Hence, significant investments have been made in developed countries to stimulate the growth of information and communication technology-enhanced services for the home care markets. However, digital provisioning of home care services includes major challenges. This study uses an individual longitudinal case study that explores the collaborative development of a video-based elderly care service to deepen the understanding of these challenges. The findings emphasize the importance of analyzing the contextual value for a variety of relevant stakeholders and identifying the key persons who are personally committed to the long-Term collaborative development. The observed challenges also call for actions by policy makers to increase the dynamicity of service development in long-Term research and development projects. Our theoretical contribution suggests integrating new service development theories with service-dominant logic and systems theories. This integration provides a means to contextualize the value of the service for individual beneficiaries, and it also contributes to coping with the complexity of new service development. For business practitioners, we translate these insights into propositions about new service development in the context of health and social care service systems. © 2015 INFORMS.",Codevelopment; Digitalization; Health service; Ict-enhanced service; New service development; Transformation

"Tasha L., Suzanne L.",Adoption of emerging in-store technology interfaces for the apparel retail employee,2015,"Technology use in apparel retail stores is on the rise and changing the way that employees work and customers shop. In spite of increased use, advanced technology deployed within apparel retail stores has yet to match the rapid pace of growth for technologies adopted by apparel consumers enabled by mobile devices and sophisticated digital applications. Apparel retail employees are the first line of contact for customers and are often engaged with them at several points in the service interaction, including assisting with the initial selection of apparel based on customers' desired product features, the try-on of clothing, and unique in-store services like personal shopping. In this chapter, the authors examine employee usage intent for technologies supportive of these various points of service interaction. The likelihood of employee usage of technology as well as employee characteristics that influenced the extent of technology adoption were also measured. © 2015 by IGI Global.

De Filippi P.,Translating Commons-Based Peer Production Values into Metrics: Toward Commons-Based Cryptocurrencies,2015,"Commons-based peer production (CBPP) constitutes today an important driver for innovation and social and cultural development, both online and off-line, through the establishment of an alternative, commons-based ecosystem, relying on peer production and collaboration among peers contributing toward a common good. Yet, to the extent that it operates outside of the market economy, the value of CBPP cannot be understood by relying exclusively on traditional market mechanisms (such as pricing). Based on empirical research on emerging value forms in the context of CBPP, we seek to achieve a better understanding of the value produced by CBPP communities, so as to come up with an alternative, universal, denominator of value that could act as an interface between the commons-based ecosystem and the market economy. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Cruz S.O.,Alternative futures of global governance: scenarios and perspectives from the global south,2015,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide a critical and informative exploration of the emerging roles and rising influence of the Global South in shaping the future of global governance. Specifically, it inquires into the following questions: How is the Global South impacting the way we govern globally? What are the pushers, pulls and weights to the futures of global governance? Using Jim Dator’s alternative futures archetype, what is the future of global governance? What are the emerging issues and trends? Design/methodology/approach - It uses Sohail Inayatullah’s futures triangle to map the drivers - the pushes, pulls and weights of global governance and Jim Dator’s archetypes - continued economic growth, collapse, conserver and transformation - to imagine and construct alternative futures of global governance. Findings - The futures triangle analysis maps and reveals three diverse but causally linked Global South narratives of global governance. The pulls of the future include the Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa leading the way, and emerging economies reinforcing the pluralization of global governance discourses and systems. New governance regimes create new global governance dynamics and North - South relations. Their increasing social, political and economic clout leads to new governance structures. The Global South’s rising human development index, economic growth, decreasing financial reliance, the rise of minilateralism and South - South cooperation is a push of the present. Weights are recurring financial constraints, their lack of technical capacity, existing international laws, stagnating bureaucracy, poverty, domestic issues and state centrism (among others). Four alternative global governance scenarios emerge: a harmonious world is everybody’s business - a state-centric and economic growth global governance future. Here, the dynamics of global governance remain the same as zero-sum thinking informs the rules of the game. In dangerous transitions and the rise of the rest, however, the status quo is disrupted as power shifts rapidly and detrimentally. Then, in mosaic of the old structure, the South embraces protectionism, and the old vanguards return. Finally, in all boats rise substantially, power is redistributed as emerging states gain larger, formal (and informal) leadership roles in global governance. The global world order is re-designed for the Global South. A world parliament is created and stronger regional confederation or unions emerge. Research limitations/implications - This paper extensively utilizes existing and emerging literature, official reports, blogs, interviews, books and other digital texts on global governance. The sources relevance is analyzed using the futures triangle tool and dissected to present four detailed scenarios using Dator’s alternative futures archetype. This study seeks to initially explore alternative futures of global governance from the perspective of the Global South. While some studies have approached the topic, only a few authors have addressed global governance using futures tools and methods. The goal of this research is to map and explore some alternative futures of global governance. The paper is less useful in predicting what lies ahead. Its intention is to highlight the “rise of the different” and to create a space for more meaningful conversations on global governance. Practical implications - This research could provide futurists, policy-makers, international relations scholars and global governance advocates some alternative narratives, frameworks and images of global governance. While it does not offer any specific structures and solutions, it offers a number of emerging issues and perspectives from the Global South that decision-makers and institutions might want to consider as they rethink global governance. Social implications - This paper highlights the emerging roles and perspectives of the Global South in global governance. It identifies some “trading zones” and “emerging issues” that may inspire actors to create new global governance spaces, innovate alternative narratives and design new frameworks of global governance. Originality/value - It maps and constructs some plausible scenarios of global governance that emphasize Global South perspectives while using futures tools and methods. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Alternative futures; Emerging issues; Futures triangle; Global governance; Global South; Non-state actors; Transformation
Yeh B.T.,"An overview of the ""patent trolls"" debate",2015,"Congress has recently demonstrated significant ongoing interest in litigation by ""patent assertion entities"" (PAEs), which are colloquially known as ""patent trolls"" and sometimes referred to as ""non-practicing entities"" (NPEs). The PAE business model focuses not on developing or commercializing patented inventions but on buying and asserting patents, often against firms that have already begun using the claimed technology after developing it independently, unaware of the PAE patent. PAEs include not only freestanding businesses but patent holding subsidiaries, affiliates, and shells of operating companies that want to participate in the PAE industry and/or a new means of countering competitors. The proliferation of PAEs was among the central factors raised in support of the most recent patent reform legislation, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act of 2011 (AIA). However, the AIA contains relatively few provisions that arguably might impact PAEs, apparently because of lively debate over what, if anything, should be done about them. In the 113th Congress, the Saving High-Tech Innovators from Egregious Legal Disputes (SHIELD) Act of 2013 (H.R. 845) has been introduced in an effort to affect the number of lawsuits filed by PAEs. PAEs emerged alongside the burgeoning tech industry around the turn of the 21st century and gained notoriety with lawsuits claiming exclusive ownership of such ubiquitous technologies as wireless email, digital video streaming, and the interactive Web. They have had the attention of Congress, the press, and the public since at least 2006, when a successful PAE suit almost caused the shutdown of BlackBerry wireless service. Such victories in court are rare for PAEs; they lose 92 percent of merits judgments. But few cases make it that far. The vast majority of defendants settle because patent litigation is risky, disruptive, and expensive, regardless of the merits; and many PAEs set royalty demands strategically well below litigation costs to make the business decision to settle an obvious one. For most PAEs, the costs of litigating and losing are more than offset by the licensing fees they can gain by demonstrating their tenacity to future defendants. According to one estimate, PAEs generated $29 billion in direct costs from defendants and licensees in 2011, a 400 percent increase over §7 billion in 2005, and some researchers suggest these costs are primarily deadweight, with less than 25 percent flowing to support innovation and at least that much going towards legal fees. Another study reported that 62% of all patent suits filed in 2012 were brought by PAEs. Critics assert that PAEs undermine the purposes of patent law-promoting innovation by providing incentives to invest in development and commercialization of inventions-and injure companies that play a vital role in the American economy. However, defenders of PAEs argue that they actually promote invention by adding liquidity options, managing risk, and compensating small inventors. The Federal Trade Commission and several leading scholars suggest that these benefits exist but are significantly less than the costs they impose. What remains unclear is the extent of imbalance between costs and benefits and whether Congress could recalibrate it to advance the goals of patent law while avoiding unintended consequences. This report reviews the current debate and controversy surrounding PAEs and their effect on innovation, examines the reasons for the rise in PAE litigation, and explores the legislative options available to Congress if it decides that these are issues that should be addressed. © 2015 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",

Kwami J.D.,"Gender, entrepreneurship, and informal markets in Africa: Understanding how ghanaian women traders self-organize with digital tools",2015,"Mainstream scholarship on entrepreneurship focuses on firms in the global north as the dominant paradigm, neglecting potential lessons to be found in the informal sector, in the global south, particularly in Africa, and among women. Local entrepreneurship practices present a valuable case study for understanding the nature of entrepreneurship in emerging economies and their contribution to social and economic development. Drawing on ethnographic data, this chapter examines gender and information and communication technology use in the Ghanaian marketplace. Market women's entrepreneurship is influenced by social capital derived from social networks drawn from strong community ties. The study found that ICTs such as mobile phone, while gendered, are central to organizing and managing these micro-enterprises. This chapter contributes to studies on entrepreneurship by drawing attention to the under-researched intersections of female entrepreneurship in the Ghanaian marketplace and ICTs in emerging economies. © 2015 by IGI Global.

"Umadikar J., Sangeetha U., Kalpana M., Soundarapandian M., Prashant S., Jhunjhunwala A.","mASK: A functioning personalized ICT-based agriculture advisory system: Implementation, impact and new potential",2015,"While Indian agriculture contributes merely 13.9% of the country's Gross Domestic Product, nearly 52% of the population still depends on agriculture for its livelihood. Close to half of the farmers are small farmers (owning 1.0 ha or less) facing near-stagnant productivity. This is due to several factors, but farmers often indicate that access to the right information at the right time is one of the most sought after need. Addressing this need to aid in the development of a productive and sustainable agricultural sector has certainly emerged as one of the major humanitarian challenges in India. There have been numerous efforts in this direction with the setting up of agricultural advisory systems, to provide information to farmers, but not many have succeeded in the objective of providing easily accessible, sustainable, personalized advisories to farmers. Recognizing this, the Indo-UK Advanced Technology Centre of Excellence in Next Generation Networks, Systems and Services (IUATC), a major technology transfer initiative, supported by the Department of Science and Technology (DST) in India and UK Government under the Digital Economy Theme is attempting to address the challenges in Indian agriculture through Information and Communication Technology (ICT) networks. This paper presents a functioning Agricultural Advisory System that has been built with the aim of bridging information gaps between farmers and agriculture knowledge workers (such as agricultural scientists and extension workers) and is an extension of a technology effort that has been previously presented. While our earlier work only discussed the potential of using an innovative ICT approach to providing personalized agricultural advisories, this paper covers details of the technology implementation, presents a brief summary of the impact analysis carried out with the farmers registered into our system and discusses new features that could make the system more effective. © 2014 IEEE.",Agricultural Technology; Agriculture Advisory System; Call Centre; Dashboard for farmers; Interactive Voice Response System; Mobile telephony applications
Grimes S.M.,Configuring the Child Player,2015,"Scholars from various disciplines have explored the powerful symbolic function that children occupy within public discourses of technology, but less attention has been paid to the role this plays in the social shaping of the technologies themselves. Virtual worlds present a unique site for studying how ideas about children become embedded in the artifacts adults make for them. This article argues that children’s virtual worlds are fundamentally negotiated spaces in which broader aspirations and anxieties about children’s relationships with play, technology, consumer culture, and the public sphere resurface as “configurations” of an imagined, ideal child player. The article begins with a brief overview of the children's virtual worlds phenomenon, followed by a discussion of related research on children’s play and play technologies. Findings from a case study of six commercial, game-themed virtual worlds targeted specifically to children are then presented, with a focus on how these artifacts configure their child players in highly ideological and normative ways, wherein play is narrowly defined in accordance with a neoromantic, consumerist ethos. The article aims to uncover the hidden politics inscribed within a particular genre of children’s technology and to explore some of the implications for children’s digital play. © The Author(s) 2014.",arts and aesthetics; children and technology; governance; markets/economies; politics; power; representation

"Zhao F., Wallis J., Singh M.",E-government development and the digital economy: a reciprocal relationship,2015,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to capture and understand the nature of the relationship between e-government development and the digital economy. Design/methodology/approach – Drawing on the Technology Acceptance Model and Fountain’s technology enactment theory, a multidimensional research model was developed. The model was tested empirically through an international study of 67 countries using reputable archival data, primarily including the UN’s e-government survey and the Economist Intelligence Unit’s digital economy rankings. Findings – The empirical findings indicate a strong positive reciprocal (two-way) relationship between e-government development and the digital economy. This finding provides empirical evidence to support the general notion of “co-evolution” between technology and organisations. The study also finds that along with social, economic, political, technological and demographic factors, certain national cultural characteristics have significant effects on the digital economy and e-government development. Research limitations/implications – Relying on archival global data sets, this study is constrained by the coverage and formulation of the data set indices, the sample size (67 countries), and the impossibility of detecting errors that may occur in the process of data collection. Therefore, caution should be taken when making generalisations about the findings of this study. Originality/value – The paper addresses a deficit of empirical research that is supported by sound and established theories to explain short-term dynamics and the long-term impact of the digital economy on public administration.

In mid-2013, cities of Brisbane, Australia and Vancouver, Canada both released their 'Digital Strategy' documents to strengthen their economy by enhancing digital connections amongst citizens, business, and the whole city as a digital organisation. The paper critically investigates the digital strategies developed for the two cities to understand how they utilise the potentials of the digital economy in their respected cities and regions. The results identify fundamental differences in the two documents' core focus that firstly define different roles for the digital strategies in Brisbane vs. Vancouver, and secondly could highly affect the implications of the strategies for the two cities' overall economic development. Nevertheless, both Vancouver and Brisbane are still in the early days of implementing their digital strategies, and the paper has to be understood as a prelude to further empirical investigation.

"Crew M.A., Brennan T.J.",Postal and delivery innovation in the digital economy,2015,"Worldwide, postal and delivery economics is the subject of considerable interest. The postal industry s business model is in drastic need of change. Notably, the European Commission and member states are still wrestling with the problems of implementing liberalization of entry into postal markets, addressing digital competition, and maintaining the universal service obligation. In the United States, the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006 has, perhaps, exacerbated some of the problems faced by the United States Postal Service (USPS). Currently, the USPS has serious financial problems because of difficulties it faces in making changes and the failure of the Act to address problems that have been long-standing. Electronic competition is severe and affects post offices (POs) worldwide, which have been slow to address the threat. This book addresses this new reality and includes discussion of how POs may attempt to reinvent themselves.

"Ahmed E., Akhlaq A.",Digital commerce in emerging economies: Factors associated with online shopping intentions in Pakistan,2015,"Purpose – More research is needed to understand the online shopping behaviors and intentions of consumers in emerging economies. The purpose of this paper is to examine the extent to which key variables from the Technology Acceptance Model (perceived usefulness (PU) and ease of use (PEOU)), and others theoretically associated with digital engagement (distrust, perceived risk (PR), perceived enjoyment (PE) and legal framework (LF)), accounted for variation in online shopping intentions in Pakistan, focussing on affiliates of a large metropolitan university. Design/methodology/approach – Online survey using a convenience sample of university staff, students and alumni recruited through the university’s online network. A questionnaire capturing the above constructs was tested for content validity and reliability prior to dissemination. The survey results were factor analyzed to determine the degree to which the constructs were independent, and regression was used to examine their ability to predict online purchasing intentions. User characteristics were analyzed descriptively. Findings – All six independent factors, PU, PEOU, PR, PE, distrust and LF, in the model were independently predictive of intention to shop online and supported the theoretical model by demonstrating the predicted direction of the relationship. Research limitations/implications – There are limitations in the generalizability of the findings. Most of the data being collected were only from Karachi, the biggest metropolitan city and the business hub of Pakistan. Practical implications – This research may help retailers in becoming e-tailers. The model would also help existing e-tailers to streamline their business according to the research findings. In addition, government may work on policies to provide a better online business environment to the people of Pakistan. Originality/value – A new online shopping model has been discovered for an emerging market, Pakistan. Developing countries could take advantage of this model to get real insights of their e-tailing industry. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",e-Commerce; Factor analysis; Online shopping; Pakistan; Technology Acceptance Model

An eastern European country's approach,2015,"In the digital economy, Smart City represents one of the medium and long-term multi-dimensional objectives of each city on its road to modernity. This trend becomes even more obvious in the case of cities from countries with emerging economies. The aim of this paper is to compile a literature review in accordance with the Smart City concept and the models tackled for the smartness-type analysis. It is followed by the improvement and concrete application of the European model proposed by the team coordinated by Giffinger in 2007 for the Romanian cities, as an emerging economy country in East Europe. In order to attain this goal, the authors developed an exploratory research method based on direct observation accompanied by the synthetic and critical analysis of several selected Romanian cities that fulfil the minimum criteria of smart cities in compliance with the European methodology. The results of this study reveal that from the 41 cities, only 6 fulfilled the minimum criteria.",Digital economy; Smart cities; Smart cities framework; Smart community
"Kazlauskaitė R., Autio E., Šarapovas T., Abramavičius Š., Gelbūda M.",The speed and extent of new venture internationalisation in the emerging economy context,2015,"Objective: The objective of this paper is to explore to what extent the patterns of the internationalisation process described in the new venture (NV) internationalisation theory, developed on the experience and practice of advanced economy firms, apply to the emerging economy context. Research Design & Methods: The paper is a systematic literature review developed on the basis of peer reviewed journal articles on NV internationalisation in emerging economies. It critically evaluates the applicability of arguments proposed by the NV internationalisation theory to the emerging economy context. Findings: In contrast to firms from advanced economies, internationalisation of NV from emerging economies is mainly driven by push factors related to their domestic markets. Transportation, communication and digital technology play a less relevant role in emerging economies; besides, their significance is more context specific; while their absence does not inhibit rapid internationalisation. Implications & Recommendations: To better understand the process of NV internationalisation in the emerging economy context, it is necessary to study to what extent other theoretical logics contribute to its explication. Further research should also seek to synthesise findings of research on other major theoretical frameworks. Contribution & Value Added: The paper contributes to the NV internationalisation theory by offering some propositions on the specifics of international entrepreneurship in the emerging economy context. © 2015, Cracow University of Economics.

Researchers and policymakers thus need a clear picture of digital businesses, but conventional datasets and typologies tend to lag real-world change. We use innovative 'big data' resources to perform an alternative analysis for all active companies in the UK, focusing on ICT-producing firms. Exploiting a combination of observed and modelled variables, we develop a novel 'sector-product' approach and use text mining to provide further detail on key sector-product cells. We find that the ICT production space is around 42% larger than SIC-based estimates, with around 70,000 more companies. We also find ICT employment shares over double the conventional estimates, although this result is more speculative. Our findings are robust to various scope, selection and sample construction challenges. We use our experiences to reflect on the broader pros and cons of frontier data use. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

"Zhang J.J., Lichtenstein Y., Gander J.",Designing scalable digital business models,2015,"Digital business models are often designed for rapid growth, and some relatively young companies have indeed achieved global scale. However, despite the visibility and importance of this phenomenon, analysis of scale and scalability remains underdeveloped in management literature. When it is addressed, analysis of this phenomenon is often over-influenced by arguments about economies of scale in production and distribution. To redress this omission, this paper draws on economic, organization, and technology management literature to provide a detailed examination of the sources of scaling in digital businesses. We propose three mechanisms by which digital business models attempt to gain scale: engaging both non-paying users and paying customers; organizing customer engagement to allow self-customization; and orchestrating networked value chains, such as platforms or multi-sided business models. Scaling conditions are discussed, and propositions developed and illustrated with examples of big data entrepreneurial firms.

"Gu Z., Tayi G.K.",Investigating firm strategies on offering consumer-customizable products,2015,"Advances in the digital economy have driven the trend among manufacturers, particularly those in the information technology (IT) industry, to offer products that consumers can self-customize to satisfy their idiosyncratic needs. This study examines firm strategies on offering such consumer-customizable products. Our analysis shows that a monopolistic firm obtains a greater profit from offering a consumer-customizable product than from offering a preconfigured standardized product only if consumers are sufficiently capable to conduct the customization task; otherwise, it is more profitable for the firm to offer a standardized product. Moreover, consumers obtain a greater surplus when the firm offers the customizable product. We also consider the case where the firm is capable of offering both a customizable product and a standardized product and find that the firm benefits more from offering both products than offering either product if consumer customizing capability and the customization cost are not too high. Interestingly, when the firm offers both products, its effort in enhancing consumer customizability (e.g., offering free consumer training) always benefits both the firm and consumers, but its effort in increasing the value of the standardized product (e.g., offering more functions) can hurt both the firm profit and consumer surplus. Our theoretical results explain many interesting business practices and provide useful insights for marketing practitioners. © 2015 INFORMS.",Consumer customization; Consumer-customizable product; Game theory; IT products; Standardized product

"Jung C., Padman R.",Disruptive digital innovation in healthcare delivery: The case for patient portals and online clinical consultations,2015,"Health care is the largest service sector in many economies worldwide, but it lags behind other industries in the use of efficient and innovative approaches to both patient care and service organization. Thus, innovative, disruptive models of healthcare delivery that leverage current information, communication, and decision technology platforms in novel ways have the potential to change the practice of healthcare delivery and management. To satisfy the growing demand for medical care, several new models are currently being developed and piloted, such as online medical consultations, which do not rely on face-to-face visits as the sole model of care delivery. Alongside, the current patient-centered care imperative has also resulted in the use of portal technologies, among others, to inform, engage, and empower the patient in shared decision making. In this chapter, we briefly introduce different types of digital service innovations in health care and provide some details about these current streams of care delivery innovations, particularly in the primary care setting given its broad influence on overall healthcare services. Furthermore, we focus on the potential of online care delivery that includes web portal services for patients and online medical consultations beyond simple email communications between patients and physicians. We conclude with a brief discussion of the implications of these models for the future of healthcare delivery in the digital age. © Springer-Verlag London 2015.",Disruptive service innovation; eHealth; eVisit; Online medical consultation; Patient portal

"Powers S.M., Jablonski M.",The real cyber war: The political economy of internet freedom,2015,"Contemporary discussion surrounding the role of the internet in society is dominated by words like: Internet freedom, surveillance, cybersecurity, Edward Snowden and, most prolifically, cyber war. Behind the rhetoric of cyber war is an on-going state-centered battle for control of information resources. Shawn Powers and Michael Jablonski conceptualize this real cyber war as the utilization of digital networks for geopolitical purposes, including covert attacks against another state's electronic systems, but also, and more importantly, the variety of ways the internet is used to further a state’s economic and military agendas. Moving beyond debates on the democratic value of new and emerging information technologies, The Real Cyber War focuses on political, economic, and geopolitical factors driving internet freedom policies, in particular the U.S. State Department's emerging doctrine in support of a universal freedom to connect. They argue that efforts to create a universal internet built upon Western legal, political, and social preferences is driven by economic and geopolitical motivations rather than the humanitarian and democratic ideals that typically accompany related policy discourse. In fact, the freedom-to-connect movement is intertwined with broader efforts to structure global society in ways that favor American and Western cultures, economies, and governments. Thought-provoking and far-seeing, The Real Cyber War reveals how internet policies and governance have emerged as critical sites of geopolitical contestation, with results certain to shape statecraft, diplomacy, and conflict in the twenty-first century. © 2015 by the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois.

Zambelli S.,"Dynamical coupling, the non-linear accelerator and the persistence of business cycles",2015,"Many of the research questions and programmes that were posed and suggested by Richard Goodwin remain highly relevant today for various methodological, empirical and theoretical reasons. This paper addresses the issue of whether highly articulated and complex economic interactions can be represented by a simplified low-dimension model. We follow the valuable insight offered by Goodwin in 1947, concerning the importance of dynamical interactions (coupling) and the potential role of analogue and/or digital computers in studying them fruitfully. The non-linear, dynamic multiplier-flexible accelerator model of the business cycle proposed in 1951 is extended to the case in which these economies are coupled through trade. The dynamics implied by the coupling are studied by analogy with the well-known Fermi-Pasta-Ulam problem. It is shown that for non-linear economies, even when they are exactly the same, i.e. having the same structural behavioural equations, the very rich dynamics depend crucially on the initial conditions. This result is somewhat unexpected. © The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Cambridge Political Economy Society.

The purpose of this news diversity research component of the ARC project is to investigate the implications of mobile news content provision, including for the development of media diversity policies. These Asian news case studies (in Hong Kong, South Korea, the People's Republic of China [PRC] and Japan) explore the dynamic relations between old and new media industries and the transformations underway: the governance/content management of digital news apps and how this relates to other masthead content; their availability and how they are accessed; the usage patterns of particular news brand apps; and, their afford-ability together with platform access and handset histories, including branded/proprietary content arrangements associated with specific portals and telecommunications networks. The research draws on industry interviews with key personnel (in senior editorial, information technology [IT] and management roles) in selected news media organisations conducted in 2013 and 2014 in Hong Kong, Seoul, Beijing and Tokyo.

Helbing D.,"Thinking ahead-essays on big data, digital revolution, and participatory market society",2015,"The rapidly progressing digital revolution is now touching the foundations of the governance of societal structures. Humans are on the verge of evolving from consumers to prosumers, and old, entrenched theories - in particular sociological and economic ones - are falling prey to these rapid developments. The original assumptions on which they are based are being questioned. Each year we produce as much data as in the entire human history - can we possibly create a global crystal ball to predict our future and to optimally govern our world? Do we need wide-scale surveillance to understand and manage the increasingly complex systems we are constructing, or would bottom-up approaches such as self-regulating systems be a better solution to creating a more innovative, more successful, more resilient, and ultimately happier society? Working at the interface of complexity theory, quantitative sociology and Big Data-driven risk and knowledge management, the author advocates the establishment of new participatory systems in our digital society to enhance coordination, reduce conflict and, above all, reduce the ""tragedies of the commons,"" resulting from the methods now used in political, economic and management decision-making.

""It is becoming increasingly clear that many of our institutions and social structures are in a bad way and urgently need fixing. Financial crises, international conflicts, civil wars and terrorism, inaction on climate change, problems of poverty, widening economic inequality, health epidemics, pollution and threats to digital privacy and identity are just some of the major challenges that we confront in the twenty-first century. These issues demand new and bold thinking, and that is what Dirk Helbing offers in this collection of essays. If even a fraction of these ideas pay off, the consequences for global governance could be significant. So this is a must-read book for anyone concerned about the future."" Philip Ball, science writer and author of Critical Mass ""This collection of papers, brought together by Dirk Helbing, is both timely and topical.

"Fong B., Lo M.F., Ng A.",Healthy use of internet for personal knowledge management: An interventionist approach in tertiary education,2015,"Recent studies on use of Internet among youngsters suggest problematic behaviour and adverse impacts on overall health as there are uncharted boundaries of information and media through Internet. Such related problems include Internet addiction, shyness, alienation, psychological distress and academic performance decrement over time. As a consequence, the ability of students in tertiary education to communicate effectively and interact humanly could deteriorate as they become more accustomed to networking via Internet. However, students nowadays do increasingly rely on the Internet to perform research under the knowledge-based economy despite concerns over reliability and truthfulness of information available from Internet. Against such a background, we construct a framework for an optimal use of Internet with the main purpose of Personal Knowledge Management (PKM). We argue for an interventionist approach to orient students in tertiary education to develop a strategic mindset that utilizes Internet as a source for developing knowledge about learning outcomes while mitigating the risks associated with over-reliance and inadequate uses. There are specific skills of PKM for an optimal use of Internet. These skills can be learned in the initiation of a study programme and reinforced in course delivery, which include course assessments and assignments provided. Students are advised on the validated sources, such as electronic databases and e-libraries that are well-recognized as knowledge bases for studying and learning. PKM aims to orient students in tertiary education to develop a strategic mindset that exploits Internet as a source for developing knowledge about learning outcomes while mitigating the risks associated with over-reliance and inadequate uses. The importance of orientation, on-going monitoring and reinforcing position habits through pedagogies should be emphasized. A key potential benefit of this approach is to prevent students from adopting habits of using Internet that could cause health-related problems and develop into behaviours that inhibit their future developments.",Internet addiction; Knowledge-based economy; Personal knowledge management; Tertiary education

One solution to the above-mentioned challenges is sharing professional knowledge, good practices, and work, by applying innovative teaching methods in order to find the synergies in teaching, also in higher education. The starting point for implementing co-teaching is administrative encouragement, which requires a willingness to take risks and an acceptance of experimental quality.

"Kenney M., Rouvinen P., Zysman J.",The Digital Disruption and its Societal Impacts,2015,"Deepening digitalization and globalization has induced an ongoing societal transformation that may ultimately prove to be as significant as the original industrial revolution. Even as the ICT industry is being restructured, global competition is being transformed. Previously dominant firms—including telecommunications carriers, equipment providers, and powerful legacy software firms—are under assault from the move to cloud computing, in the network center, and mobile computing, on the network periphery. This transformation of the computing and communication infrastructure has been occurring simultaneously with the spread of ever more complicated and sophisticated global value chains. The articles in this special issue explore a number of the key facets of this transformation in a comparative lens. The authors find that the social, legal, and economic arrangements will impact how these changes affect nation-states.

"Beverungen A., Böhm S., Land C.","Free Labour, Social Media, Management: Challenging Marxist Organization Studies",2015,"In this paper we explore how so-called ‘social media’ such as Facebook challenge Marxist organization studies. We argue that understanding the role of user activity in web 2.0 business models requires a focus on ‘work’, understood as value productive activity, that takes place beyond waged labour in the firm. A reading of Marx on the socialization of labour highlights the emerging figure of ‘free labour’, which is both unpaid and uncoerced. Marxist work on the production of the ‘audience commodity’ provides one avenue for understanding the production of content and data by users as free labour, but this raises questions concerning the distinction between productive and unproductive labour, which is central to Marx’s labour theory of value. The Marxist literature on ‘the becoming rent of profit’ allows for a partial understanding of how the value produced by free labour is captured, thereby developing the understanding of the economic dimension of ‘free labour’ as unpaid. It overstates, however, the ‘uncontrolled’ side of free labour, and neglects the ways in which this work is managed so as to ensure that it is productive. We therefore call for a return to Marxist labour process analysis, albeit with an expanded focus on labour and a revised understanding of control associated with digital protocols. On this basis, a Marxist organization studies can contribute to an understanding of the political economy of digital capitalism. © The Author(s) 2015",critical management studies; digital capitalism; Facebook; free labour; Marx; social media; sociology of work; value

Huberty M.,Awaiting the Second Big Data Revolution: From Digital Noise to Value Creation,2015,"“Big data”—the collection of vast quantities of data about individual behavior via online, mobile, and other data-driven services—has been heralded as the agent of a third industrial revolution—one with raw materials measured in bits, rather than tons of steel or barrels of oil. Yet the industrial revolution transformed not just how firms made things, but the fundamental approach to value creation in industrial economies. To date, big data has not achieved this distinction. Instead, today’s successful big data business models largely use data to scale old modes of value creation, rather than invent new ones altogether. Moreover, today’s big data cannot deliver the promised revolution. In this way, today’s big data landscape resembles the early phases of the first industrial revolution, rather than the culmination of the second a century later. Realizing the second big data revolution will require fundamentally different kinds of data, different innovations, and different business models than those seen to date. That fact has profound consequences for the kinds of investments and innovations firms must seek, and the economic, political, and social consequences that those innovations portend. © The Author(s) 2015.",Big data; Business models; Digitalization; Technological change; Value creation
"Qian Y., Xie H.",Drive more effective data-based innovations: Enhancing the utility of secure databases,2015,"Databases play a central role in evidence-based innovations in business, economics, social, and health sciences. In modern business and society, there are rapidly growing demands for constructing analytically valid databases that also are secure and protect sensitive information to meet customer and public expectations, to minimize financial losses, and to comply with privacy regulations and laws. We propose new data perturbation and shuffling (DPS) procedures, named MORE, for this purpose. As compared with existing DPS methods, MORE can substantially increase the utility of secure databases without increasing disclosure risk. MORE is capable of preserving important nonmonotonic relationships among attributes, such as the inverted-U relationship between competition and innovation. Maintaining such relationships is often the key to determining optimal levels of policy and managerial interventions. MORE does not require data to be of particular types or have particular distributional shapes. Instead, it provides unified, flexible, and robust algorithms to mask general types of confidential variables with arbitrary distributions, thereby making it suitable for general-purpose data masking. Since MORE nests the commonly used generalized linear models as special cases, a much wider range of statistical analyses can be conducted by using the secure databases with results similar to those achieved by using the original databases. Unlike existing DPS approaches that typically require a joint model for all variables, MORE requires no modeling of nonconfidential variables and thus further increases the robustness of secure databases. Evaluation of MORE through Monte Carlo simulation studies and empirical applications demonstrates that it performs better than existing data-masking methods. © 2015 INFORMS.",Database; Digital economy; Innovation; Nonparametric; Perturbation; Privacy; Shuffling

Berisha-Shaqiri A.,Management information system and competitive advantage,2015,"We have known full of examples where the use of information technology and computer systems are seen as factors for competitive advantage. Even this paper aims to highlight how businesses provide satisfactory support and achieve competitive advantage through the management information systems. Information Management System aims to make enterprise environment as safe by providing information on competition and market. Therefore, we say that the quality of governance in an enterprise depends on the development and design of information systems based on computers that are designed according to the requirements and needs of the enterprise system. Increasing the pressure of competition forces businesses to fight for new research, new products and new markets, these businesses move can only afford having support from a quality information system. This support should enable higher quality solution for the governance of resources that businesses possess. In the last decade, information technology had a significant development. As the result, businesses have undergone a series of changes in the way of cooperation, presentation, finding buyers, suppliers, and placing products at the market. Management information systems to support management activities, this means that the structure of an information system can be classified within the hierarchy of activities, planning and management control. Activities vary according to levels of low, middle and senior management. Managers need different types of information, and the information needs determined by the decisions that must be taken. Contemporary management is increasingly dependent on information technology, because without a perfect technology and available data, the software may not have adequate information to be managers in making decisions. © 2015 Mediterranean Journal of Social Sciences.

They can achieve an economy of scale and greatly facilitate the commodification of music works. However, due to the excessive market power held by these organisations, it is also possible for CMOs to harm both copyright holders and their licensees. Consequently, consent decrees between ASCAP, BMI and the US Department of Justice (DOJ) aim to deter CMOs from abusing their market power. Additionally, individuals are also entitled to take private actions against CMOs' anticompetitive behaviours. Further, faced with the fragmented online music copyrights, challenged by the common use of digital equipment, the collective management of copyrights in the USA calls for substantial reforms.

The work aims to bridge the gap between theory and practice, and highlight the areas of potential research. Design/methodology/approach - The study employs a systematic and critical review of the relevant literature to explore the challenges posed by Big Data to hardware technology, and assess the worthiness of hardware technology at various stages of Big Data analysis. Online computer-databases were searched to identify the literature relevant to: Big Data requirements and challenges; and evolution and current trends of hardware technology. Findings - The findings reveal that even though current hardware technology has not evolved with the motivation to support Big Data analysis, it significantly supports Big Data analysis at all stages. However, they also point toward some important shortcomings and challenges of current technology trends. These include: lack of intelligent Big Data sources; need for scalable real-time analysis capability; lack of support (in networks) for latency-bound applications; need for necessary augmentation (in network support) for peer-to-peer networks; and rethinking on cost-effective high-performance storage subsystem. Research limitations/implications - The study suggests that a lot of research is yet to be done in hardware technology, if full potential of Big Data is to be unlocked. Practical implications - The study suggests that practitioners need to meticulously choose the hardware infrastructure for Big Data considering the limitations of technology. Originality/value - This research arms industry, enterprises and organizations with the concise and comprehensive technical-knowledge about the capability of current hardware technology trends in solving Big Data problems.

Wonglimpiyarat J.,The new Darwinism of the payment system: Will Bitcoin replace our cash-based society?,2015,"This paper is concerned with the new Darwinism of the payment system. The researcher discusses the payment system to understand if Bitcoin would replace our cash-based society. The analysis is based on the technology S-curve and Schumpeter’s model of economic development. At present, there are problems hindering Bitcoin innovation to achieve a wide adoption as the innovation is not well received by the government central banks around the world. It is interesting to see that the swing of S-curves is not strong enough to cause a paradigm shift according to the Schumpeterian concept of creative destruction. The results have shown parallel S-curve trajectories of electronic money innovations signifying a move from a cash-based economy towards a less cash society. The study provides useful implications to support the diffusion of Bitcoin innovation. © 2015 Wonglimpiyarat J.",Bitcoin; Cashless; Darwinism; Digital money; Payment system

As James Cortada describes what was once called the ""office appliance industry,"" he challenges our view of the digital computer as a revolutionary technology. Cortada interprets reliance on computers as a development within an important segment of the American economy that was earlier represented largely by such instruments as typewriters, tabulating machines, adding machines, and calculators. He also describes how many of the practices of the office appliance industry evolved into those of the computer world. Drawing on previously unavailable industry archives, the author adds to our understanding of IBM's early history and offers short corporate histories of firms that include NCR, Burroughs, and Remington Rand. Focusing on the United States but also including comparative material on Europe and Asia, Before the Computer will be a unique source of knowledge about the companies that built office equipment and their enormous impact on economic life. © 1993 by Princeton University Press.

"Polasik M., Piotrowska A.I., Wisniewski T.P., Kotkowski R., Lightfoot G.",Price fluctuations and the use of bitcoin: An empirical inquiry,2015,"Over recent years, interest has been growing in Bitcoin, an innovation that has the potential to play an important role in e-commerce and beyond. The aim of our paper is to provide a comprehensive empirical study of the payment and investment features of Bitcoin, and their implications for the conduct of e-commerce. Since network externality theory suggests that the value of a network and its take-up are interlinked, we investigate both adoption and price formation. We discover that its returns are driven primarily by Bitcoin's popularity, the sentiment expressed in newspaper reports on cryptocurrency, and total number of transactions. The paper also reports on the first global survey of merchants who have adopted this technology, and we model the share of sales paid for with this alternative currency, using both ordinary and Tobit regressions. Our analysis examines how country-, customer-, and company-specific characteristics interact with the proportion of sales attributed to Bitcoin. We find that company features, use of other payment methods, customers' knowledge about Bitcoin, and the size of both the official and unofficial economy are significant determinants. The results will be of interest to traders who seek to understand factors driving prices and will help to inform vendors as to the most favorable circumstances for adopting the currency for online transactions. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Bitcoin; cryptocurrency; digital money; electronic money; emerging technologies; financial services; online payments; peer-To-peer network; technology adoption
"Ferreira E.J., Steenkamp R.J.",The exploration of the triple helix concept in terms of entrepreneurial universities and corporate innovation,2015,"University-industry-innovation networks (UIINs) are made up of entrepreneurial higher education institutions, industry and government. Universities such as Scotland’s Strathclyde University, which was the entrepreneurial university of 2013 in the UK, organise themselves as co-productive institutions by means of technology transfer offices (TTOs), innovation centres and a variation of offices for knowledge transfer and university-business-co-operation (UBC). Such a network is referred to as the triple helix approach/concept/model of co-operation between industry, universities and government, with the aim of building an enterprising state in which these partners co-innovate in order to solve global economic challenges. The global economy faces multiple challenges represented by indicators such as the World Health Organisation’s (WHO’s) spiralling health-care needs, unemployment, un-sustainable changes to the environment and rapidly emerging digital business models. Most universities promote academic engagement with industry for various reasons (e.g. to generate a third stream of income). The effective management of triple helix takes UBC to the next level in terms of a formal prominent mission for the university. This article broadly describes the triple helix concept and analyses several international cases. The three main objectives of this article are to: 1) explore triple helix and the related concepts such as UBC and TTO; 2) determine the leading stakeholders of the triple helix model; 3) conduct a content analysis of triple helix case studies (45) in four groups, namely (1) national innovation strategies, (2) entrepreneurial universities, (3) entrepre-neurship education, and (4) new initiatives, frameworks and technologies. © 2015, Virtus Interpress.

"Avci B., Girotra K., Netessine S.",Electric vehicles with a battery switching station: Adoption and environmental impact,2015,"The transportation sector's carbon footprint and dependence on oil are of deep concern to policy makers in many countries. Use of all-electric drive trains is arguably the most realistic medium-term solution to address these concerns. However, motorist anxiety induced by an electric vehicle's limited range and high battery cost have constrained consumer adoption. A novel switching-station-based solution is touted as a promising remedy. Vehicles use standardized batteries that, when depleted, can be switched for fully charged batteries at switching stations, and motorists only pay for battery use. We build a model that highlights the key mechanisms driving adoption and use of electric vehicles in this new switching-station-based electric vehicle system and contrast it with conventional electric vehicles. Our model employs results from repairable item inventory theory to capture switching-station operation; we embed this model in a behavioral model of motorist use and adoption. Switching-station systems effectively transfer range risk from motorists to the station operator, who, through statistical economies of scale, can better manage it. We find that this transfer of risk can lead to higher electric vehicle adoption than in a conventional system, but it also encourages more driving than a conventional system does. We calibrate our models with motorist behavior data, electric vehicle technology data, operation costs, and emissions data to estimate the relative effectiveness of the two systems under the status quo and other plausible future scenarios. We find that the system that is more effective at reducing emissions is often less effective at reducing oil dependence, and the misalignment between the two objectives is most severe when the energy mix is coal heavy and has advanced battery technology. Increases in gasoline prices (by imposition of taxes, for instance) are much more effective in reducing carbon emissions, whereas battery-price-reducing policy interventions are more effective for reducing oil dependence. Taken together, our results help a policy maker identify the superior system for achieving the desired objectives. They also highlight that policy makers should not conflate the dual objectives of oil dependence and emissions reductions as the preferred system, and the policy interventions that further that system may be different for the two objectives. © 2015 INFORMS.",Business model innovation; Electric vehicles; Public policy; Sustainable operations; Transportation
Evan W.,Literacy work in the reign of human capital,2015,"In recent years, a number of books in the field of literacy research have addressed the experiences of literacy users or the multiple processes of learning literacy skills in a rapidly changing technological environment. In contrast to these studies, this book addresses the subjects of literacy. In other words, it is about how literacy workers are subjected to the relations between new forms of labor and the concept of human capital as a dominant economic structure in the United States. It is about how literacies become forms of value producing labor in everyday life both within and beyond the workplace itself. As Evan Watkins shows, apprehending the meaning of literacy work requires an understanding of how literacies have changed in relation to not only technology but also to labor, capital, and economics. The emergence of new literacies has produced considerable debate over basic definitions as well as the complexities of gain and loss. At the same time, the visibility of these debates between advocates of old versus new literacies has obscured the development of more fundamental changes. Most significantly, Watkins argues, it is no longer possible to represent human capital solely as the kind of long-term resource that Gary Becker and other neoclassical economists have defined. Like corporate inventory and business management practices, human capital—labor—now also appears in a “just-in-time” form, as if a power of action on the occasion rather than a capital asset in reserve. Just-in-time human capital valorizes the expansion of choice, but it depends absolutely on the invisible literacy work consigned to the peripheries of concentrated human capital. In an economy wherein peoples’ attention begins to eclipse information as a primary commodity, a small number of choices appear with an immensely magnified intensity while most others disappear entirely. As Literacy Work in the Reign of Human Capital deftly illustrates, the concentration of human labor in the digital age reinforces and extends a class division of winners on the inside of technological innovation and losers everywhere else. © 2015 Fordham University Press.

Mohamed Nour S.,Overview of Sudanese economy and the status of ICT in Sudan,2014,"This chapter presents an overview of Sudanese economy and the trend and status of ICT in Sudan. Section 2.2 explains some stylised facts along with other strategic problems confronting economic development in Sudan that, it explains that Sudan's economy has been characterised by low GDP per capita income, presence of high rates of poverty, unemployment and inequalities in resources sharing. Section 2.3 explains the trend and status of core ICT indicators in Sudan. We show that in the recent years, Sudan has shown growing telecommunication networks and Internet services and the diffusion of ICT in Sudan has increased significantly. We explain that recent indicators from International Telecommunication Union (ITU) 2014 show the trend of core ICT indicators and illustrate that despite recent slowdown in terms of fixed telephone, the recent average growth rate of the total online population, Internet, fixed (wired)-broadband and mobile-cellular subscribers in Sudan during the period 2000-2013 has been significant. ITU 2014 data for 2000-2013 indicates that in Sudan the growth rate of mobile-cellular telephone (1,039.71) is faster than Internet (755.67), fixed (wired)-broadband (59) and fixed telephone (-0.04) respectively. We show that the status of ICT indicators in Sudan in 2013 can be explained by regional and international standards compared to Arab countries and world regions respectively. We find that ITU 2014 data for 2000-2013 indicates that by regional and international standards the rapid increase in ICT indicators in Sudan that appear from the increasing use of Internet and mobile-cellular telephone and the increasing proportion of households with Internet and proportion of households with computer are above that of Africa but below Arab region and World region, whereas the use of fixed-telephone in Sudan is less than Africa, Arab region and World region. This implies that by regional and international standards, ICT indicators in Sudan are below compared to Arab countries and World regions. Our findings indicate that the reported increasing trend of mobile and Internet usage at the aggregate macro level in Sudan seems consistent with the observed increasing trend at the regional and international levels. We find evidences in support of the incidence of the global digital divide between Sudan and the World countries, developed countries and developing countries that appear from ICT Development Index (IDI), access sub-index, use sub-index and skills sub-index over the period (2011-2012). Our results indicate that the reported digital gap in core ICT indicators at the aggregate macro level in Sudan compared to world regions seems consistent with the observed development gap in social, economic, human development and education indicators in Sudan compared to world regions. © 2015 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",
Mohamed Nour S.,Conceptual framework and reviews of theoretical and empirical literature,2014,"This chapter presents the conceptual and theoretical framework and theoretical and empirical literature that emphasize the positive effects of ICT in enhancing knowledge and economic growth and the negative effects of ICT through exacerbating the digital divide. We explain the debate on the effects of ICT and the economic opportunities and the challenges that ICT imposes on the production and dissemination of knowledge in the world economy. We illustrate that on the one hand, some studies provide robust results showing the various influences of ICT on enhancing economic growth and development, not only directly, but also indirectly through enhancing knowledge and through the complementary relationships between ICT, human capital and skill upgrading. We explain that on the other hand, several studies discuss the hazards ICT creates for economic development. In particular, the rapid progress in ICT will make it harder for the developing countries to bridge the already existing and widening gap and digital divide between the developed and developing countries. Based on our findings from the existing studies in the literature we highlight the need for improvement of investment in ICT to alleviate the digital divide, enhance production, creation and transfer of knowledge in higher education institutions and to enhance economic growth and sustainable development in Sudan. © 2015 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",
"Benghozi P.-J., Paris T.",The cultural economy in the digital age: A revolution in intermediation?,2014,"The new digital economy seemingly is leading to the disappearance of intermediaries. Externalities and the ongoing comparison of competitors favor dominant players; creators and producers also can distribute their content directly to consumers, bypassing any intermediaries. This movement exhibits some contradictory tendencies though. Online transactions give space to various unforeseen intermediation patterns involving contractual relations, information processing, and customer relations. In doing so, they alter cultural sectors and fundamentally challenge traditional organizations and revenues. This overhaul particularly affects economic actors, selection and creative processes, distribution channels, and cultural practices, as well as production structures. Accordingly, the Internet has had notable effects on the complexity of artistic and cultural markets. Various cultural fields thus reveal the emergence and simultaneous development of different ways to create, produce, make available, and charge for contentsdthat is, different business models. These unfamiliar intermediations drive reorganizations of cultural industries, because they invent innovative economic terms, restructure common forms of creation and recommendation, prompt new forms of entrepreneurship, and stimulate competition by newcomers. This study scrutinizes all these reconfigurations according to three current developments in cultural industries: the vast increase of available contents, the solid entrepreneurial dynamics in online markets, and renewed business models. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

"Price R., Wrigley C., Dreiling A., Bucolo S.",Design LED innovation: Shifting from smart follower to digital strategy leader in the Australian airport sector,2014,"This paper presents and discusses organisational barriers and opportunities arising from the dissemination of design led innovation within a leading Australian airport corporation. This research is part of a greater action research program which aims to integrate design as a strategic capability through design led innovation within Australian businesses. Findings reveal that there is an opportunity to employ the theoretical framework and tools of design led innovation in practice to build collaborative idea generation by involving customers and stakeholders within the proposal of new to world propositions. The iterative gathering of deep customer insights also provided an opportunity to leverage a greater understanding of stakeholders and customers in strengthening continuing business partnerships through co-design. Challenges to the design led approach include resistance to the exploratory nature of gathering deep customer insights, the testing of long held assumptions and market data, and the disruption of an organisational mindset geared toward risk aversion instilled within the aviation industry. The implication from these findings is that design led innovation can provide the critical platform to allow for a business to grow and sustain internal design capabilities necessary to challenge prevailing assumptions about how its business model operates to deliver value to customers and stakeholders alike. The platform of design led innovation also provides an avenue to support a cultural transformation towards anticipating future needs necessary for establishing a position of leadership within the broader economic environment. © 2013 IEEE.",action research; customer relationships; design thinking; digital economy; innovation

"Bardt H., Kempermann H.",The German Energiewende: Is the manufacturing sector at risk?,2014,"The abandonment of nuclear power and the new focus on renewable energy sources represent a fundamental change in the structure of Germany’s electricity supply. In the wake of this change in energy policy (which is widely referred to as the energy turnaround), prices immediately started to rise and further increases are to be expected in the years ahead. In the case of the manufacturing sector, this cost burden has been mitigated by exempting the energy-intensive sectors that are most affected. However, this causes high levels of uncertainty for large electricity consumers as their current exceptional status may be called into question at some point in the future. Moreover, the price and cost effects of the German energy policy are not only restricted to energy-intensive enterprises. While the metal production industry, parts of the chemical industry and others have to deal with higher price risks, other industries are closely linked to these electricity consumers in complex value chains. Large segments of the manufacturing sector work closely with energy-intensive companies. These dense networks particularly bear fruit in the joint development of innovations, one of German industry’s main competitive advantages. This strength of the German economy may turn into a risk if the future of electricity-intensive industries is hampered by rising national energy prices. A potential relocation of energy-intensive companies to other countries would thus also weaken the competitiveness of other areas of German industry. These risks need to be compared with the new market opportunities provided by the energy turnaround. The industry sees such opportunities especially in renewable energies and techniques for improving energy efficiency. © 2014, Infopro digital. All rights reserved.",

"Soler L.S., Gonçalves D., Gregorio L.T., Leal P., Saito S.",Combining geo-information technology and empirical knowledge to improve natural disaster early warning and monitoring systems in Brazil,2014,"Population growth in urban areas drives people vulnerability to natural disasters, especially in emergent economies like Brazil. The existing automatic pluviometric network is insufficient to provide enough information to monitor and prevent deaths due to landslides and floods in 821 municipalities defined as priority ones in the Brazilian National Plan of Risk Management and Response to Natural Disasters, implemented in 2012. Therefore, aiming to support early warning and monitoring systems and make available near-real time rain data, the National Early Warning and Monitoring Centre of Natural Disasters (Cemaden) has carried out an integrative institutional project to acquire and identify optimal places to install 1400 automatic pluviometers in risk areas of landslides and/or floods, already mapped in more than 350 Brazilian municipalities where existing network is scarce. Using geo-information techniques, the methodology included a deficit analysis to estimate the needed number of pluviometers per municipality. These estimates were used in a cooperative action between Cemaden and institutions at state and municipality levels, especially municipality governments and their civil defenses. A number of technical meetings and fieldwork training were done in 14 from the 27 Brazilian Federal Units in several municipalities to promote the project. Cemaden developed a dedicated web database where the institutions' representatives were able to supply detailed information of suitable sites to install pluviometers inside or nearby risk areas, based on their empirical knowledge of local characteristics. The results so far are very promising as 1, 500 locations have been filled since March 2013, and around 600 were chosen as optimal installation sites using spatial analysis. As the pluviometers installations take place, we expect a significant improvement on the efficiency and confidence of early warnings of landslides and floods as well as more commitment of local governments and communities to respond to warnings. © 2013 IEEE.",Brazil; Empirical; Natural disaster; Pluviometric network; Spatial analysis

Wilsdon J.,Digital futures: Living in a networked world,2014,"Beyond the hype about dot-coms, WAP phones and dot-com entrepreneurs, what impacts will e-commerce have on society? How will it affect jobs and local communities? What will it mean for the environment - for energy use, transport and the future shape of our cities? How can we ensure that everyone enjoys the benefits of the new digital technologies? This is a groundbreaking exploration of the social and environmental impacts and opportunities of the new economy. It brings together the leading thinkers and visionaries from the worlds of policy, business and academia in an insightful, vigorous and at times controversial examination of the impact e-commerce will have on the way we live and work, and on the environment on which we all depend. © Forum for the Future, 2001.

"Jackman M., Lorde T.",Why buy when we can pirate? The role of intentions and willingness to pay in predicting piracy behavior,2014,"Purpose: Digital piracy is one of the most popular forms of intellectual property theft and is currently recognized as a crime in several countries. This begs the question, if persons are fully informed that digital file sharing is a crime and, if caught, can be legally prosecuted, why do individuals opt to engage in such criminal behaviour? The purpose of the paper is to determine the psychological, social and economic factors influencing digital piracy. Understanding the social and psychological features of digital pirates is necessary if effected strategies are to be developed to deter the practice of digital piracy. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, a representative sample drawn from the population of Barbados was surveyed. The conceptual models were estimated using ordinary least squares multiple regression, Tobit estimation and quantile regression. Findings: The results suggest that intentions and willingness to pay (WTP) both have a significant impact on digital piracy. Intentions are in turn influenced by the pirate's attitude, perceived consequences, ethics, education level and environment. Finally, a facilitating environment and perceived importance of the piracy issue help to predict' WTP for digital products. Originality/value: To the best of the knowledge, no other study has combined notions from attitude/values/behaviour with that of WTP. Yet, the literature would suggest that they both have significant impacts on the quantity of digital goods that are pirated. It is possible that not modelling their joint impact could have resulted in loss of vital information. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Barbados; Crime; Digital piracy; Social economy
Rhodes K.M.,Digital trade on the internet and its role in U.S. and global economies,2014,"At the request of the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance, the U.S. International Trade Commission undertook an investigation to better understand the role of digital trade-domestic commerce and international trade conducted via the Internet-in the U.S. and global economies, as well as the effects of barriers and impediments to digital trade that impede U.S. access to global markets. This book shows that digital trade contributes to economic output by improving productivity and reducing trade costs. Digital trade also contributes to the economy as a whole as it facilitates communication, expedites business transactions, improves access to information, and improves market opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).",
"Horinouchi K., Takabayashi N., Yamamoto H., Ohba M.",A study of sales increase and/or decrease by campaign using a differential equation model,2014,"With society becoming more advanced and complex, the required management engineering makes essential the development of human resources that can propose solutions for problems of new phenomena from a different perspective. As an example of such phenomena, we note a consumer electronics 'Eco-point' system campaign in this study. To mitigate global warming, revitalize the economy, and encourage the adoption of terrestrial digital compatible TVs, the consumer electronics Eco-point system campaign was implemented in May 2009 in Japan. In this study, we note a model which is constant term with exponential curve with notion of the growth phenomenon (Nakagiri and Kurita, Journal of the Operations Research Society of Japan, 2002). In our study, we call this model the 'differential equation model of the growth phenomenon.' This model represents a phenomenon with a hierarchical structure for capturing the properties of n species. In this study, we propose a new model which can represent not only the impact of largescale campaigns but also seasonal factors. Accordingly, we understand the phenomenon of fluctuation of sales of some products caused by large-scale campaigns and predict the fluctuation of sales. The final goal of this study is to develop human resources that can propose provision and solution for pre-consumption and reactionary decline in demand by understanding the impact of large-scale campaigns. As the first step of this goal, our objective is to propose a new regression method with different conventional perspective that can describe the fluctuation of sales caused by large-scale campaigns and show the possibility of new management engineering education. © 2014 KIIE.",Differential equation model; Prediction; Regression; Subsidiary growth phenomenon
"Gupta M., Jin S., Lawrence Sanders G., Sherman B.A., Simha A.",Virtual worlds: A review,2014,"Virtual Worlds have emerged as important socio-technical artifacts with the potential to impact many important facets of contemporary society and to enable unique, novel business models in the digital economy. The authors present a rich account of the ways in which virtual worlds interact with modern society, their present heuristics, and future promise, with examples of successes and failures. The present and projected impact of virtual worlds on corporate business models, on the academic sphere, on cutting-edge healthcare, and on society in general are examined based upon existing literature, and legal issues arising from virtual worlds are summarized.

Castronova E.,Wildcat currency: How the virtual money revolution is transforming the economy,2014,"Private currencies have always existed, from notes printed by individual banks to the S&H Green Stamps to Bitcoin. Today's economy has seen an explosion of new forms of monetary exchange not created by the federal government. Credit card companies offer points that can be traded in for a variety of goods and services, from airline miles to online store credit. Online game creators have devised new mediums of electronic exchange that turn virtual money into real money. Meanwhile, real money is increasingly going digital, where it competes with private currencies like Bitcoin. The virtual and the real economic worlds are intermingling more than ever before, raising the possibility that this new money might eventually replace the government-run system of dollars, euros, and yen. Edward Castronova is the leading researcher in this field, a founder of scholarly online game studies and an expert on the economies of virtual worlds. In this dynamic and essential work, he explores the current phenomenon of virtual currencies and what it will mean legally, politically, and economically in the future. In doing so, he provides a fascinating, often surprising discourse on the meaning of money itself-what it is, what we think it is, and how we relate to it on an emotional level. © 2014 by Edward Castronova.

Zekos G.I.,Risk management and corporate governance in 21st century digital economy,2014,"Governance designates all regulations intended for organization and centralization of human societies on a global scale. The management of corporations organizes the efforts of individuals in order to achieve aims and objectives using available resources inventively and efficiently. Risk management is a practice of steadily choosing cost-effective tactics for diminishing the consequence of threat realization to the corporation which cannot be evaded for the reason that there are financial and practical limits, which means the acceptance of some degree of residual risks. Cyberspace strengthens national and global governance. E-business involves the total digitization of value chains and business processes, and serving traditional organizations creates new value and reach up to that time unattained heights of operational and financial excellence. E-technology and e-commerce produce new challenges for both risk management and corporate governance which could be solved by effective utilization of a continuous development of the means of risk management such as information technology, logistics, networks and a constantly improved ERM in order to comply with the new developments. A highly educated personnel controlled by an effective human resources management is a prime means for accomplishment of effective risk management and corporate governance in a 21st century digital economy. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The continuing absolute fall of ICT prices and ICT capital prices, respectively, is not adequately considered in the standard analysis of ICT. In the study presented here the ICT investment-GDP ratio is calculated in real terms and it is shown that this ratio is higher (order of magnitude is about 2 percentage points) than the nominal investment-GDP ratio which is misleading the ICT sector, policy makers and society at large. Moreover, we take an innovative look at the digital time budget of private households in selected OECD countries. Assuming that 10 % represents the relevant share of the time budget the digital value-added of private households stands for an unrecorded digital value-added of 2-5 % of gross domestic product; with a share of 20 % of the household's internet time budget devoted to value-added the hidden internet value-added in the US would be in the range of 4.7-10.4 %.

"Al-Debei M.M., Aloudat A., Al-Lozi E., Al Asswad M.M.",The role of value networks in the design of mobile platforms: The case of Apple iPhone,2014,"Unlike the simple mobile voice service, which is normally designed and developed by the telecom itself, the development of mobile data services and platforms, due to their complexity, usually requires a collaboration and cooperation amongst many actors within and outside the mobile telecommunication industry such as mobile network operators, content providers, content aggregators, payment gateways, regulatory commissions, and others. The actors usually form the so-called value network in which each actor complements others and adds important value elements to the final value proposition given that actors have different knowledge domains, backgrounds, and expertise. Contrasting value chains where the relationships amongst different parties are to some extent simple and linear, the relationships linking actors in value networks are mainly complex and non-linear, and such relationships had led to a shift from forming value chains to creating value networks in many digital economies such as the mobile telecommunication industry. Although it is argued that designing powerful value networks is critical to the success of mobile platforms, very limited research can be found on explaining and proving this argument. As such, this chapter intuitively utilizes a methodical approach to explain the role of value networks in the design of successful mobile platforms. This chapter demonstrates, through the case of iPhone, how a powerful and well-designed value network is a critical enabler of innovations in the mobile telecommunications industry. Further, the chapter argues that cohesion, fitting network-mode, uniqueness, and dynamicity are four key value drivers of powerful value networks. © 2014, IGI Global.",
Burhan M.,Postal operators as viable e-government partners: A case study of three major postal operators,2014,"The digital economy has transformed several industries, resulting in higher productivity, greater consumer choice and lower prices.Digital platforms of communication are producing massive competition in the postal sector. Traditional mail volume is down, while delivery points are up. The digital world provides opportunities to various public, as well as private, organizations to broaden their services and product range. Most postal operators worldwide have responded positively to this opportunity, and adopted postal e-services to improve the quality of existing services and introduce new value-added services. e-Government, which involves use of information and communication technology to facilitate the development of small and efficient government structures, has found a natural implementation partner in postal services, which have a vast and extensive network of outlets and a broad outreach in the country. This study explores the extent of the various roles played by different postal operators in implementing e-government services. Case studies based on Empresa Brasileira de Correios e Telegrafos, Post Italiane and Saudi Post are taken up to analyze their role as e-government serviceprovider partners. The study will help to outline the potential role of postal operators in helping governments implement digital services.",Digital economy; E-government; E-services; Ict; Postal operators
"Kim T.-Y., Kim E., Park J., Hwang J.",The faster-accelerating digital economy,2014,"The digital economy is one of the most important features of the knowledge-based society of the future. Based on information and communications technology (ICT), it grows faster than and eventually overtakes the traditional industrial economy. The fundamental driving forces of the digital economy’s faster economic growth are as follows. First, ICT converges with and improves the efficiency of traditional industries. Second, the production function of the ICT industry shows increasing returns to scale. Third, the development of ICT stimulates not only demand and supply but the entire expansive reproduction system, resulting in faster-accelerating economic growth. This paper investigates the essentials, causes, and patterns of the faster economic growth of the digital economy, and forecasts its future on the basis of real-life examples from the US, Finland, and Ireland.

Al-Khouri A.M.,Digital identity: Transforming GCC economies,2014,"Governments and businesses alike are coming to understand that national and global economies should use the Internet as a medium for innovation and economic growth. A critical component that has been left to service providers to establish and manage is that of digital identities of online clients and customers. Lack of regulation and effective methods of management has resulted in greater concerns over privacy, security, and productivity in online environments, thus hindering the development and use of the full potential of the Internet. This paper attempts to explore the role of a government initiated digital identity management system in supporting the creation of a stronger digital economy. The author provides an overview of the identity management infrastructure development initiatives in Gulf Cooperation Council countries and briefly examines their potential to revolutionize and transform existing economic models. The author argues that the new smart identity cards produced in these countries may serve as secure tokens that connect digital and physical identity, create trustworthy environments, and strengthen confidence in online transactions critical to the growth of the digital economy. © eContent Management Pty Ltd.",Digital economy; Digital identity; E-business; E-commerce; E-government; Identity management
"Oprescu G., Eleodor D.",The impact of the digital economy’s development on competition,2014,"The digital economy is comprised of markets based on digital technologies that enable and conduct the trade of goods and services through electronic commerce on the Internet. The constantly growing importance of the Internet for the retail markets raises several competition concerns due to increased price transparency. Against this background, the objective of this paper is to provide an overview over the issues that seem to become more challenging and frequent concerning competition in digital markets and its assessment, starting with selective distribution systems (in particular, the vertical restraint called resale-price-maintenance) and then turning towards the effects of two-sided markets and highly dynamic markets on competition on the market and its assessment. Thus, the first section identifies the main inevitable factors that are changing the environment in which competition regulation works. The second section asks the question of whether competition regulators are well equipped to deal with such sharp changes or are presumably outpaced by such changes. After answering to this dilemma, the third section assesses what could be the competition enforcers role in a knowledge-based economy and how should competition rules be enforced in digital markets. Some concluding remarks will follow. © 2014, SRAC - Societatea Romana Pentru Asigurarea Calitatii.

Ng I.C.L.,New business and economic models in the connected digital economy,2014,"This article discusses business models as a systemic phenomenon as opposed to traditional reductionistic approaches of business disciplines. It presents the ways connectivity changes economic models due to the availability of consumption data as an economic resource, markets forming at consumption spaces and how industries could disrupt one another when connected through consumption technologies. The article further suggests that the challenges posed by connectivity result in the redrawing of traditional firm and market boundaries. It proposes more research into modularity, transaction costs, the future role of the firm and the necessary transformation of businesses to stay agile in a connected digital economy. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.",Business models; Consumption; Digital economy; Economic models; Markets; Transformation
Quiggin J.,National accounting and the digital economy,2014,"The construction of national accounts by Colin Clark and others was a major contribution to, and assisted the documentation of, the prosperity of the second half of the 20th century. In the 21st century, the crucial problem is to account for the value of information. Information is, naturally a public good, even though it is costly to produce. Moreover, the distinctions central to the 20th century economy, such as those between primary, secondary and tertiary industry, and between households and the market economy are increasingly irrelevant. These changes bring new policy challenges and, with them, the need for new systems of national accounting. © 2014.",Information economy; National accounting
Schiller D.,Digital depression: Information technology and economic crisis,2014,"The financial crisis of 2007-08 shook the idea that advanced information and communications technologies (ICTs) as solely a source of economic rejuvenation and uplift, instead introducing the world to the once-unthinkable idea of a technological revolution wrapped inside an economic collapse. In Digital Depression, Dan Schiller delves into the ways networked systems and ICTs have transformed global capitalism during the so-called Great Recession. He focuses on capitalism's crisis tendencies to confront the contradictory matrix of a technological revolution and economic stagnation making up the current political economy and demonstrates digital technology's central role in the global political economy. As he shows, the forces at the core of capitalism--exploitation, commodification, and inequality--are ongoing and accelerating within the networked political economy. © 2014 by Dan Schiller.

"Breznitz S.M., Noonan D.S.","Arts districts, universities, and the rise of digital media",2014,"In the last decade, arts and culture have been placed at the center of attention when discussing economic growth. In particular, studies on the ""creative class"" have been using arts and culture as an important factor impacting local economies. In addition, studies on local economic development have frequently viewed universities as a major factor in economic growth. In the middle of this discussion is new economic growth via creativity, via new recipes and new combinations of local capital, and via innovation centers. Combining these disparate literatures brings to center stage both clusters of arts and culture and concentrations of research and human capital development. Hence, the focus of this paper is to analyze the dual impacts of universities and arts districts on innovation and economic growth through employment in digital media. The results indicate that cultural districts have a consistently positive effect on local digital media economic activity-employment and innovation.

Despite this, Manchester remains home to some of the most socially and economically deprived communities in the UK: just as those who work in the city earn the highest salaries outside London, those who live in the city earn the lowest salaries of the UK’s Core Cities. Responding to the particular challenge widespread deprivation poses for a city experiencing economic growth, the administration has deployed an entrepreneurial model of urban development, characterized by close partnerships with private organizations and local actors.

Design/methodology/approach: Five value-creating opportunities are likely to drive further progress in the dynamic experience economy: customizing goods; enhancing services; charging for experiences; fusing digital technology with reality; and transformative experiences, a promising frontier. Findings: For leaders, five insights about the value-creating opportunities are key to achieving success via state-of-the-art experience staging, and they provide tested guidelines for managing in the experience economy, now and into the future. Practical implications: A huge first step in staging more engaging experiences is embracing the principle that work is theatre. So businesses should ask: What acts of theatre would turn our workers' functional activities into memorable events? Originality/value: Three key lessons: innovation to create high-quality experiences that customers will pay for is even more important than goods or service innovation.

Lesame Z.,The South African digital access index,2014,"International and national data made available during the past few years indicate that access to and use of information and communication technology (ICT) and services is experiencing slow growth in South Africa. In the early 2000s, South Africa led Africa in terms of ICT infrastructure development. However, more recent ICT statistics indicate that other African countries, such as Nigeria and Mauritius are advancing faster than South Africa in this regard. The World Economic Forum Global Information and Communication Report (2012, in e-Skills Institute Newsletter, 2012a) states that the sub-Saharan African region still has the least developed ICT infrastructure in the world, and also has a severe lack of ICT skills. Having considered the Southern African ICT infrastructure deficiencies, this article captures and evaluates ICT policy and regulatory interventions instituted by South Africa towards the creation of a knowledge society. The article starts by providing brief historical background on ICT access and use in South Africa, and states the stakeholders engaged in transforming South Africa towards e-readiness. The Digital Access Index is applied as a measuring instrument or research method to measure the South African e-readiness status. Further, the article evaluates the progress of South Africa towards becoming an information society by comparing levels of public access to, and usage of ICT in South Africa with those of selected African countries and BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) countries.",Digital access index; Digital inclusion; Digital literacy; E-skills; Information society; Information superhighway or internet; Internet economy; Technology access

Traditional economic activities, and the administrative rules governing them, face the challenge of adapting to developments that blur the dividing lines, for example, between shop and online sales or between traditional media and Internet communication. Convergence of this type will lead to a European Digital Single Market. A genuine Digital Single Market would generate new types of growth and also sustainable economic and social benefits for all European citizens. There are still a number of barriers which impose obstacles for the development of the digital market in Europe. Obstacles which can be identified include national differences regarding data protection rules, e-commerce rules, consumer protection rules and other legislation pertaining to information flows. The paper brings in discussion the advantages of a Digital Single Market, the obstacles in developing it in connection with e-commerce regulations, consumer protection and information flows legislation and also the premises for implementing a Digital Single Market. Consumers' trust in on-line commerce results as one of the driving factors in implementing a Digital Single Market. These are some of the main obstacles for the boosting consumers' confidence in the European Single Market. Improving consumer confidence in cross-border shopping online by taking appropriate policy action could provide a major boost to economic growth in Europe.

Weber T.A.,"Intermediation in a Sharing Economy: Insurance, Moral Hazard, and Rent Extraction",2014,"A key impediment to sharing is a lender's concern about damage to a lent item due to unobservable actions by a renter, usually resulting in moral hazard. This paper shows how an intermediary can eliminate the moral hazard problem by providing optimal insurance to the lender and first-best incentives to the renter to exert care, as long as market participants are risk neutral. The solution is illustrated for the collaborative housing market but applies in principle to any sharing market with vertically differentiated goods. A population of renters, heterogeneous both in their preferences for housing quality and with respect to the amount of care they exert in a rental situation, face a choice between collaborative housing and staying at a local hotel. The private hosts choose their prices strategically, and the intermediary sets commission rates on both sides of the market as well as insurance terms for the rental agreement. The latter are set to eliminate moral hazard. The intermediary is able to extract the gains the hosts would earn if transacting directly. Finally, even if hotels set their prices at the outset so as to maximize collusive profits, collaborative housing persists at substantial market shares, regardless of the difference between the efficiencies of hosts and hotels to reduce renters' cost of effort. The aggregate of hosts, intermediary, and hotels benefits from (a variety in) these effort costs, which indicates that the intermediated sharing of goods is an economically viable, robust phenomenon.

"Pantea S., Martens B.",Has the digital divide been reversed?-Evidence from five EU countries,2014,"This paper examines whether there is a digital divide in the use of the internet in general and of specific websites (leisure, improving human capital and obtaining goods and services). It uses a unique dataset which covers the entire clickstream of almost 20,000 internet users in the five largest EU economies during 2011. Our main finding is that, for those who have access to the Internet, the income-based digital divide in internet use at home has been reversed. Low-income internet users spend more time on the internet at home than high-income users on all types of websites. There is some evidence of an education-based digital divide in the use of human capital and goods & services websites. Tertiary education has a negative effect on time spent on leisure websites and a positive effect on time spent on human capital and goods & services websites. Using quantile regressions, we find that the negative effect of income and the positive effect of education for human capital and goods & services websites hold for the entire conditional distribution of these online activities. Moreover, these effects are stronger for more intensive internet users. We discuss several possible explanations for these results.",Internet use; Leisure; Time allocation

Design/methodology/approach – In total, 22 persons working in elder care participated in the study. The study had a qualitative approach and focus group interviews were used to collect data. To analyze the manifest content a phenomenographic method was used. An interpretation of perceptions was then undertaken aimed at identifying underlying values. Findings – Three descriptive categories, “utility,” “impact on working environment” and “economic impact” were the result of the manifest analysis. The values of having a “good working environment,” “benefits” and “good economy” were interpreted as guidance for staffs’ acceptance or rejection of the DSM. Social implications – The care-giving process and its challenges from the perspective of the staffs need consideration. Staffs in this study sometimes expressed strong emotions as a sign of frustration for losing prerequisites to perform their work well. In big complex organizations where economy and effectiveness are often discussed, knowledge of power relations in innovation and implementation processes would be beneficial. Although moral distress is a well-known phenomenon, future research may be needed to find solutions that diminish this negative trend in more economic focussed organizations. Originality/value – This study had a twofold approach with the intention of going beyond descriptions. To gain a deeper understanding a normative interpretation was completed. Ethical conflicts are frequently characterized as conflicts between at least two values. In this study staffs expressed fear of losing prerequisites needed to perform their work well.

Cox M.,Comparative analysis of e-Government in the EU: Trends in Eastern Europe,2014,"The proliferation of diverse benchmarks for evaluating e-government performance points to a quandary. On one hand, researchers and practitioners recognize the need for flexibility in assessing particular needs, establishing goals, and monitoring progress in the public administration of unique environments. On the other, lack of consistent and holistic frameworks of analysis obstructs agreement on best practices and models that reflect common guiding principles and democratic values. To date, there is little study of the progress made by Eastern European Union member states in developing e-governance capabilities as a means to transform public administration. This paper takes two approaches in providing a comparative analysis of e-governance in eleven of those states. First, it demonstrates the different levels of complexity present on central government websites in East Europe, and second, compares user responses reported by the European Commission. Outcomes demonstrate that demands placed upon East European members to meet goals of the EU 2020 Digital Initiative are met to varying degree. As we might expect, many e-government features remain in the preliminary stage of development in this region, while user perceptions of e-government in West European states are more encouraging. Beyond noting different levels of e-government development-differences we might expect to find due to relatively recent transitions to a market economy, recent EU membership, and the digital age-preliminary observations suggest that a unique Eastern European model is in the making that will reflect the influence of persistent cultural norms, political legacies, and citizen expectations about government use of information technologies in public administration. This paper thus offers a unique perspective of e-government trends in Eastern Europe and suggests room for further investigation into ways that national governments might respond to growing public demand for more accountability, trust, and participation. It also suggests future directions that digital government assessment may take. © 2014 The Authors.",Benchmarking digital government; E-Government in East Europe; EU digital agenda; Government websites; Single entry portals

With each passing year broadband developments, and in particular the services and applications enabled by broadband, are linked more closely with economic growth and development. The European Union (EU), OECD, ITU and other international organizations have programmes that document progress, identify common barriers and best practices, and facilitate the development of broadband infrastructures. A major focus is national government policies and regulations that play key roles in stimulating, directing or restricting broadband development within dynamic markets characterized by rapidly improving technologies and enhanced digital services.

Spencer A.J.,Tourism and technology in the global economy: Challenges for small island states,2014,"Purpose: This paper sets the stage for research on the willingness and readiness of a developing country to fully embrace the changes in tourism that are being facilitated by rapidly changing technological advancements. The purpose of this paper is to explore some of the technological advancements and the debates surrounding technology adoption within the context of Jamaica. Design/methodology/approach: Using Jamaica, a developing country low on internet penetration as the site of investigation, this work suggests that there are lessons to be learned from broadly assessing its context economically, socially and technologically. This specific case is juxtaposed against the theoretical works on diffusion of technology and the digital divide to indicate the way forward for the local tourist industry. Findings: The work shows that technology diffusion and adoption has become an important area of research globally. For countries that are heavily dependent on inbound travel from regions of the world with high technology penetration and a clientele which is increasingly expecting cutting edge technology to be part and parcel of their travel plans, this type of research and application of new technologies to the travel package are critical to survival and growth. Research limitations/implications: The practical application of this paper is that it suggests that Jamaica and other developing countries can learn valuable lessons from the debates and discussions in the literature relating to technology adoption in the tourism context.

Katsamakas E.,Value network competition and information technology,2014,"A defining feature of digital transformation (the digitization of business and economy) is that networks of firms, instead of individual firms, are competing with each other. While competition shifts from the level of firm to the level of networks, it is not well understood how value networks compete. This article makes a conceptual and analytical contribution to this gap in the literature. Introducing the concepts of overlapping and non-overlapping network competition, the article analyzes network competition in a setting where firms invest in intangibles or non-contractibles, such as knowledge sharing and innovation. One main finding is that as non-contractibles become more valuable to end-consumers the industry structure is more likely to shift to competition among non-overlapping value networks. The paper proposes that IT affects network competition through the reduction of cost of investment in non-contractibles and the evolution of consumer preferences. © 2014 - IOS Press and the authors.

"Avila R.C., Jurado E.B., Moral A.M., Poyatos R.P.",Improving e-economy by regional governments,2014,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyse and assess a government support programme for business innovation in a very peripherical European region: the Spanish region of Andalucía. Design/methodology/approach: Endogenous development approach is used to categorize the main public and private actions included in the government ICT support programme. Cross-time analysis has been carried out by using three territorial indicators of diffusion and effective use of ICT: the physical aspect, refereed to the infrastructures used as a base for the information society development (infrastructures, technology and equipment); the actors and their degree of organization (firms present on the internet and support organizations and institutions); and knowledge, refereed to the technological sprawl and the entrepreneurship capacity (fostering innovation and training among the general population and businesses). Findings: The study confirms that the public policies implemented are coherent with the endogenous development approach, where investment in physical and human capital have been accompanied by enabling measures of interaction between firms and other economical agents (universities, business associations, business centres and technology institutes, etc.), with a view to favouring the dissemination of innovations and knowledge among firms. Secondly, the research assess the impact of this ICT programme, both in terms of economic growth and per capita income, as well as on the main variables that reflect the degree of business participation in the Information Society. Results show that, during the period 1996-2010, this region has made important progress in terms of convergence with more advanced European regions.

Practical implications: Recent outlooks of the OECD call for more assessment research on ICT national and regional policies around the world, especially those that prove that it is possible to broke the international digital divide. The present study suggests that public policies following the directives laid down by the endogenous development approach can reach this economic and social target. The Andalucía Information Society Programme constitutes a real commitment and private-public partnership towards a structural change in the technological culture amongst businesses. Investment in physical capital and human capital has been accompanied by measures that enable the interaction of firms with other economic agents (university, business associations, technology centres, etc.), with a view to favouring the dissemination of innovation and knowledge among firms. Originality/value: The study uses for the first time the endogenous development approach applied to a less advanced region for evaluation of ICT policy and it improves a methodology based on this approach to assess its effectiveness. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Business support services; Economic development; Information society; Innovation; Policy
Welfens P.J.J.,Issues of modern macroeconomics: new post-crisis perspectives on the world economy,2014,"Modern macroeconomics has failed in the analysis of both the US banking and the euro crises, respectively, and there is also a rather inadequate view on a range of relevant policy issues. The approach presented herein looks at the reasons for analytical failure and suggests means of improvement – picking up proposals from the literature as well as contributing new ones. The economics profession did not anticipate the banking crisis and there is reluctance to switch to a new paradigm for stabilization policy analysis. Beyond this, there are several analytical challenges which should be integrated into a post-crisis approach: for example, the question of the true degree of economic openness and the role of multinational companies. Moreover, the macroeconomic impact of the digital economic expansion is largely underestimated. The traditional view on asset bubbles has become doubtful. A new paradigm should emphasize the triple analytical challenge of short-term financial market analysis, the routine new questioning of the systemic stability of economic systems and standard macroeconomic modeling – with some refinements; a “Schumpeterian Mundell-Fleming-Solow-Akerlof-model” and sustainability aspects are important on the one hand, on the other hand NKM models have to integrate a broader array of market imperfections. The perspectives presented could jump-start a new paradigm that combines a more realistic macro perspective with a complementary critical institutional analysis. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Banking crisis; Economic policy; Forecasting; International economics; Macroeconomics
"Plorin D., Müller E.",Efficient empowerment of engineering knowledge transfer for a sustainable global economy,2014,"More than ever companies find themselves in a dynamic market with turbulent conditions, technological change and increasing competition. Sustainable industrial enterprises have recognized that the development of employee skills is a key success factor for manufacturing companies. However, it is not the easiest to address this topic with the help of a suitable learning environment. Especially in view of the projected shortages and the lag of qualified young people, it is important to develop the existing staff. Thus, sustainable and innovative learning environments need to be created to mediate the knowledge, qualifications and the necessary skills. An adequate and consistent concept reflects the advanced Learning Factory (aLF) and is presented in this paper. As part of the Experiment and Digital Factory (EDF) at the Department of Factory Planning and Factory Management of Chemnitz University of Technology, the concept of aLF provides an innovative learning environment to empower efficient and modular based transfer of knowledge directly into the user environment. It allows the configuration of various industry-related applications driven by the fields of action out of for example megatrends and research results. By integrating participatory and professional cross-field knowledge modules due to appropriate scaffolding in a model factory, thus an innovative learning environment for teaching, research and industry can be created. The paper takes the challenge of demographic change as starting point in order to review recent developments in the field of learning factories and the concept of the aLF.",Demographic change; Didactic empowerment; Learning environment
"Neirotti P., De Marco A., Cagliano A.C., Mangano G., Scorrano F.",Current trends in smart city initiatives: Some stylised facts,2014,"The concept of Smart City (SC) as a means to enhance the life quality of citizen has been gaining increasing importance in the agendas of policy makers. However, a shared definition of SC is not available and it is hard to identify common global trends. This paper provides with a comprehensive understanding of the notion of SC through the elaboration of a taxonomy of pertinent application domains, namely: natural resources and energy, transport and mobility, buildings, living, government, and economy and people. It also explores the diffusion of smart initiatives via an empirical study aimed at investigating the ratio of domains covered by a city's best practices to the total of potential domains of smart initiatives and at understanding the role that various economic, urban, demographic, and geographical variables might have in influencing the planning approach to create a smarter city. Results reveal that the evolution patterns of a SC highly depend on its local context factors. In particular, economic development and structural urban variables are likely to influence a city's digital path, the geographical location to affect the SC strategy, and density of population, with its associated congestion problems, might an important component to determine the routes for the SC implementation. This work provides policy makers and city managers with useful guidelines to define and drive their SC strategy and planning actions towards the most appropriate domains of implementation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Information systems; Public policies; Regression analysis; Smart City; Urban planning
"James L., Guile D.",Evaluating the transition from Regional Development Agencies to Local Economic Partnerships: The views of SMEs in the British West Midlands,2014,"After the election of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat Coalition in 2010, the UK Government instituted a radical reorganisation of governance structures for subnational economic development in England. This involved the abolition of Regional Development Agencies and the introduction of Local Enterprise Partnerships, defined as 'joint local authority-business bodies brought forward by groups of local authorities to support local economic development across ""functional economies""' (Department for Business Innovation and Skills, 2010: 10). This article contributes to the debate about Local Enterprise Partnerships through an exploration and analysis of the views of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) with regard to lessons to be learned from the old Regional Development Agency system and the transition to the new Local Enterprise Partnership system. Empirically, it focuses on the experiences of digital media firms in the West Midlands region (and now in the Greater Birmingham and Solihull Local Enterprise Partnership). The article draws on desk research and in-depth interviews with Regional Development Agencies and Local Authority employees involved in economic development, industry representatives and business support organisations, in addition to interviews with small and medium enterprise owners and self-employed consultants/freelancers. The research reported here adopted a longitudinal approach with four rounds of interviews between 2010 and 2013. Overall, disruption to publicly funded networks was seen as a significant cost of institutional change between Regional Development Agencies and Local Enterprise Partnerships. Valued functions of the Regional Development Agency were its role in increasing the visibility and coherence of the digital media sector and supporting networking. However, the SMEs reported considerable uncertainty regarding the role of the Local Enterprise Partnership and were concerned about the loss of well-functioning programmes and institutional support structures. © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.",digital media; Local Enterprise Partnerships; Regional Development Agencies; West Midlands
"Lin Y.-S., Chang Y.-S.",Music platform competition and advertising strategy in the duopoly music industry,2014,"Information technologies ""weed out"" the old and bring forth new industries, such as the Otaku Economy Markets and Knowledge Sharing Platforms, and influence traditional industries, especially digitization products. Digital industries also encounter several challenges (e.g., piracy and virtual channels) because of the popularization of the Internet. Hence, we used a game theory approach to compare two competing music platforms with and without paid services. We show that the paid music platform does not earn excess profits, and the relationship between socially optimal advertising and basic utility of virtual digital products are parabolically related. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg..",Advertising strategy; On-line music; Social welfare; Two stage game approach
Rampersad G.,The internet of everything: Assessing its impact on business and community,2014,"The 'Internet of Everything' (IoE) whereby each human on average is currently connected to about 200 things (smart phones, tablets, sensors and systems) has had a radical impact on business but also on community for instance through the Arab Middle Eastern Spring. This chapter examines how countries can grapple with evaluating the influence of IoE to leverage its ability to improve its impact on their economies and communities in vital areas of education and health. In addition to its relevance to governments, businesses internationally are also interested in the IoE, for instance CISCO, Microsoft and IBM in pursuing business opportunities for developing new services to leverage this connectivity. However, the extent to which this increased connectivity presents opportunities or challenges for development is yet to be assessed. A significant factor for developing communities to partake in this connectivity is the underlying Internet infrastructure. Investing in Internet infrastructure is usually a major digital investment facing developing communities. Although billions of dollars are being spent internationally on such infrastructure, there are insufficient effective tools to monitor the impact of such investment. This chapter is significant as it provides a tool for assessing the contribution of this digital investment on the economy and community, and can be used by government agencies and businesses in developing communities to identify opportunities for interventions and applications as required. © 2014 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",
Mikkonen T.,Perceptions of controllers on EU data protection reform: A Finnish perspective,2014,"Data protection regulations are undergoing a global reform. The European Commission proposed a reform of the EU data protection framework in 2012. One major driver for the reform has been the research on the consumer perceptions indicating that the consumers are worried about their personal privacy. However, there has been practically no research on perceptions of companies (the controllers of the personal data) and on the data protection reform. This research analyses the awareness and the willingness to act towards compliance regarding the proposed General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Finland in 2013. The GDPR will replace the Finnish Personal Data Act and therefore plays a central role in the Finnish privacy regulation. This research found that the general level of awareness was low: only 43% of the controllers were aware of the forthcoming reform. The willingness to act or to take steps towards the compliance was even lower: 31% of controllers said that they are planning to act towards compliance during this year. These results indicate that the companies are quite unfamiliar with the reform that correlates with other relevant studies in Europe. Personal data are said to be the oil of the digital economy, the hottest commodity of the market today. There are companies that understand this, but the majority seems to ignore this at least what comes to their awareness regarding the reform, even the reform captures many of the best practices regarding processing of personal data. © 2014 Kah Leng Ter.

They are defined as shared, open and evolving socio-technical systems providing distinct IT capabilities. The Cassandra EU project aims to enhance visibility of the international flow of goods over sea with an electronic data pipeline as an information infrastructure. This paper presents data sharing issues that could prevent adoption of the Cassandra Pipeline. Potential solutions are provided regarding access restriction and data sharing. In addition solutions are derived from the design theory for dynamic complexity in information infrastructures of Hanseth and Lyytinen (2010), proposing to gain momentum by starting small, focusing on immediate benefits for supply chain partners and obtaining experience using simple prototypes. This paper underlines that designers of the Cassandra Pipeline as an information infrastructure need to think carefully about the implications of restricting access and non-obligatory or obligatory data sharing, both allowing for generativity and trust while preventing potential abuse at the same time.",Adoption; Design science; Design theory; Digital eco systems; Digital infrastructures; Information infrastructures; Issues; Supply chain management

"Morgan A., Dix A., Phillips M., House C.",Blue sky thinking meets green field usability: Can mobile internet software engineering bridge the rural divide?,2014,"Mobile applications (apps) are becoming more commonplace as mobile phones and tablets begin to replace traditional desktop devices. Software developers are usually located in areas where good connectivity is the norm, but large numbers of users are located in other areas where 3 G connectivity is at best poor or non-existent. This results in app development which is unsuitable for many areas of the world and, as well as being a problem in rural areas of the UK, has ramifications for mobile app use in third world countries where fixed broadband services are largely absent. Drawing on experiences of users on the margins of connectivity, this paper discusses difficulties of mobile internet access in Wales and recommends changes to app development methodology to maximise bandwidth in areas of limited network coverage. © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.",digital divide; mobile internet; rural economy
"Ling F.Y.Y., Ong S.Y., Ke Y., Wang S., Zou P.",Drivers and barriers to adopting relational contracting practices in public projects: Comparative study of Beijing and Sydney,2014,"When contracting parties adopt relational contracting (RC) as opposed to formal contracting stance, the construction project may achieve good outcomes. However, public projects usually face more constraints in adopting RC, as close relationships may lead to allegations of corruption. The aim of this study is to undertake a comparative analysis of drivers and barriers to adopting RC practices in public construction projects in two different markets viz. a centrally planned economy and a free market economy by investigating practices in Beijing and Sydney. The survey research design was adopted and data of public construction projects in Beijing and Sydney were collected using a structured questionnaire. The results revealed that relationship quality and level of harmony among contracting parties are significantly good in both cities. In Sydney, the level of inter-personal relations between contractors and consultants is significantly higher than in Beijing. It was found that the same 18 factors drive contracting parties in Beijing and Sydney to adopt RC practices, and in 6 instances, these are significantly greater drivers in Sydney. The barriers to adopting RC practices are totally dissimilar in both cities. Contracting parties in Beijing could not adopt more RC practices because of a lack of training in relational arrangement and public clients lack initiative in adopting RC practices. The conservative industry culture that encourages preservation of the status quo is also prevalent in Beijing. In Sydney, the only significant barrier is public sector accountability concerns. To cultivate readiness to embrace RC practices, it is suggested that industry professionals and the government adopt recommendations highlighted in this study according to the type of market structure. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd and APM IPMA.",Australia; China; Performance; Project outcome; Relational contracting

"Eimhjellen I., Wollebæk D., Strømsnes K.",Associations Online: Barriers for Using Web-Based Communication in Voluntary Associations,2014,"Despite the high adoption level of Facebook and other social network sites (SNSs) in Norway, local level voluntary associations have not embraced SNSs to the same degree. Regular websites are the main web representation, and information provision is the main function of the associations' web representations. Using quantitative data on website content and organizational characteristics we have analyzed which factors hinder SNS adoption. The results point to size and complexity of associations and to age-based digital divides among members as important factors for having a profile on a SNS. It seems that a certain numerical point must be reached in terms of organizational and community size, for SNSs to be useful. Also, older members, smaller economy and a low degree of formalization in associations might hamper the implementation of SNSs in associations. Using Norway as a critical case, this article contributes new knowledge about web communication in voluntary organizations, an increasingly important field of research internationally. © 2013 International Society for Third-Sector Research and The Johns Hopkins University.",Nonprofit organizations; Social network sites; Technology adoption barriers; Voluntary associations; Websites
"Foulonneau M., Turki S., Vidou G., Martin S.",From open data to data-driven services,2014,"The data-driven economy promises the creation of enormous amounts of economic activity and growth opportunities. However these projections lie to a large extent in the development of new services. Currently, the results in terms of service creation remain below the expectations of open data promoters. Indeed most services created are not sustainable and / or do not use the variety of datasets. They are to a wide extent relying on a limited number of very popular datasets. To increase the reuse and the value extracted by services from data, our hypothesis is that service innovation approaches can help understand the mechanisms that drive the creation of services. We therefore propose a review the current approaches to encouraging the creation of services based on data, an analysis of the creation of services from two open data platforms, in the UK and in Singapore, and a description of the roles that the data can have in the design of services based on a theoretical framework of service innovation. © 2014 The Authors.",Data-driven service; Innovation; Open data; Service design

"Myers G.D., Crawford J.E.",Effectively addressing the risks to the infrastructure presented by extreme hazards: The need for a shift in the design paradigm,2014,"The risk of extreme damage to critical facilities by attacks from terrorists or disgruntled employees combined with process risks is becoming a major factor in the design. The approach suggested by extant practices and guides with this regard has evolved into a pseudo-design methodology involving missing columns and ""tie force"" designs and detailing. Very different design concepts are needed to analyze structures that are highly damaged or have failed completely. The new design paradigm focuses on component design of critical building elements using a threat dependent, performance-based methodology using high-fidelity physics-based (HFPB) finite element codes that capture actual material and component response. One of these is LS-DYNA developed by Livermore Software Technology Center. To counter the difficulty, expense and high degree of skills needed for use of HFPB codes one approach is to develop and use a library of fast running models (FRMs), which interrogate a database of virtual HFPB response data for given components and loading. These FRMs can be rapidly and easily run on desktop computers and can provide access to a domain of solutions far outside the capability of simplified engineering tools for a range of loading scenarios, such as air blast loading from high-explosive detonations, vapor cloud explosions, and primary and secondary fragmentation. Component design using HFB codes and FRMs for speed and economy of analysis will provide a far more meaningful analysis for blast effects, including disproportionate collapse than simplified methods advocated in the unified facilities criteria (UFC) and similar design guidance documents. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.",

These two concepts play a strategic role in the evolution of any organization, defining its competitive advantages and thus securing its future survival. Here, in this chapter, we examine them in the light of the public sector and especially in the area of educational organizations management. We investigate under which circumstances they emerge, how they flourish or fail, and what impact they have on the daily operations of a PSEO. These concepts are dynamic, so the corresponding phenomena are discussed using analytical as well as discrete methodologies. We focus our attention on policies and strategies developed by the public sector, in the frame of e-government initiatives, so as to prepare the organizations for competition in the digital future. Finally, we propose a methodology appropriate for transforming a typical conservative PSEO into a modern, innovation-endorsing, and sustainable business model. It is important to aim at and describe in detail a step-by-step process that leads smoothly to the new situation, avoiding incongruities and disruptions. This is depicted in a roadmap sketched using the basic concepts embedded on a transition diagram.

Reduced data bundle rates, the expansion of telecommunications, and the increased use of the Internet in Africa are the main driving forces. In recent times, African entrepreneurship has been in a constant state of development and flux. This paper reports the findings of an online survey conducted in Africa in 2013, investigating the experiences of entrepreneurs on the continent in adapting and incorporating online social network platforms and digital tools in both the formal and informal sectors. In recent times, African entrepreneurs have realised that the empowered, sophisticated, critical and well-informed society living on the continent in the present day is different from that of the previous post-colonial era. The Internet (and more recently social media enabled through Web2.0) has enabled the business community at large to control information and have power over the marketing process, with concomitant dilemmas and challenges for African entrepreneurs. This paper explains what role the new face of the Internet, widely referred to as Web2.0 or social media has played in unlocking this vast potential in terms of enabling the economic survival and success of modern African entrepreneur. Embracing social media platforms and tools facilitates entrepreneurship through the creation of competitive advantages that build prosperity in the modern global economy.

Universities such as Scotland's Strathclyde University, which was the entrepreneurial university of 2013 in the UK, organise themselves as co-productive institutions by means of technology transfer offices (TTOs), innovation centres and a variation of offices for knowledge transfer and university-business-co-operation (UBC). Such a network is referred to as the triple helix approach/concept/model of co-operation between industry, universities and government, with the aim of building an enterprising state in which these partners co-innovate in order to solve global economic challenges. The global economy faces multiple challenges represented by indicators such as the World Health Organisation's (WHO's) spiralling health-care needs, unemployment, un-sustainable changes to the environment and rapidly emerging digital business models. Most universities promote academic engagement with industry for various reasons (e.g. to generate a third stream of income).

This paper presents partial results of the Czech Science Foundation research project no. 403/11/0447, whose objectives are to identify the problems in merger preparation in compliance with valid Czech regulations and to analyse economic causes and consequences of mergers. The source of information is a basic dataset formed in the structure necessary for statistical analysis; the dataset was created by the project implementers. An empirical research has been conducted on the basic statistical file that contains information about all the companies in the Czech Republic, which merged in the last 10 years (2001–2010), and published in digital form financial statements in the collection of the Trade Register. We analyse temporal series reflecting the development of mergers in companies as divided by size and the role of the company in the merger process, measured by the number of mergers and volume of assets of the successor and the dissolved companies.Our research has proven that the Czech economic environment is dominated by the combinations where a larger company devours the smaller one with the objective to achieve a more advantageous position in the market and economies of scale. A closer dependence was found for development trends in the cases when the dissolved companies were larger than the successor company than in opposite cases. © 2014, Kaunas University of Technology.

"Edwards E., Lien S.",Uncertain images: Museums and the work of photographs,2014,"Almost all museums hold photographs in their collections, and museum professionals and their audiences engage with photographs in a myriad of ways. Yet despite some three decades of critical museology and photographic theory, and an extensive debate on the politics of representation, outside art museums, almost no critical attention has been given specifically to the roles, purposes and lives of these photographs within museums. This book brings into focus the ubiquitous yet entirely unconsidered work that photographs are put to in museums. The authors' argument is that there is an economy of photographs in museums which is integral to the processes of the museum, and integral to the understanding of museums. The international contributors, drawn from curators and academics, reflect a range of visual and museological expertise. After an introduction setting out the range of questions and problems, the first part addresses broad curatorial strategies and ways of thinking about photographs in museums. Shifting the emphasis from curatorial practices and anxieties to the space of the gallery, this is followed by a series of case studies of exhibitionary practices and the museum strategies that support them. The third section focuses on the role of photographs in the museum articulation of ‘difficult histories’. A final section addresses photograph collections in a digital environment. New technologies and new media have transformed the management, address and purposing in photographs in museums, from cataloguing practices to streaming on social media. These growing practices challenge both traditional hierarchies of knowledge in museums and the location of authority about photographs. The volume emerges from PhotoCLEC, a HERA funded project on museums and the photographic legacy of the colonial past in a postcolonial and multicultural Europe. © Elizabeth Edwards, Sigrid Lien and the contributors 2014.

"Shen X., Naughton B.J.","The power of ""a visible hand"" to the building of innovation capabilities: A study of China's ICT technologies",2013,"Purpose: This paper aims to provide an analytical account of the process by which China has developed its complex and infrastructural information and communication technology (ICT) systems over the last three decades, with the result that today it has become a key player in the global ICT sector. This paper discusses the role of the Chinese government in supporting and coordinating large-scale ICT system deployments and implementation, by-passing dilemmas that have beset more laissez-faire economies. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is based on two case studies in China: public digital switching systems in the 1990s and 3G mobile standards recently. The former is a typical complex system and the latter exemplifies infrastructural technology. From the tradition of science and technology studies, it incorporates historical approach into a socio-technical discourse of the process and examines the operational practices of the Chinese government in different stages. Findings: The paper demonstrates the pivotal role of government in the case of a latecomer country like China in developing and implementing complex and infrastructural ICT systems. While development of such socio-technical systems has presented challenges in many countries, the findings show the transition of socio-technical context in China has provided the best operational platform for the government to perform its roles. Originality/value: Most research into innovation capabilities focuses on technological matters, while this paper also addresses the social context, institutional mechanisms and roles for coordinating different resources and players involved. In this way, it raises questions for conventional thinking in the West that market systems can perform the best in innovation. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",China; Government roles; Innovation

"Lomotey R.K., Deters R.",RSenter: Terms mining tool from unstructured data sources,2013,"The emergence of 'Big Data' is changing the data storage status quo at the business and corporate level. Previously, relational databases have been employed to accommodate business-related digital records but in today's data economy, the data is unstructured which puts limitations on relational databases. Thus, NoSQL databases have been proposed to contain the unstructured data which is chiefly schema-less, textual, file-based, and so on. However, the rise of unstructured data and the adoption of NoSQL storages lead to emerging challenges that call for active research. Firstly, existing data mining techniques are designed for schema-based data storages and are inapplicable to NoSQL storages. Secondly, NoSQL storages are from different vendors (or, providers) so require the understanding of multiple APIs to generate queries. These two challenges hinder data extraction for most businesses since information stored can be lost due to inaccessibility. Our ongoing research has therefore proposed a tool called RSenter that aids terms mining from unstructured data storages. Specific to NoSQL storages that are document-oriented, we detail the architectural design, the algorithms, and the benefits that distinguish the tool from other existing frameworks. Significantly, RSenter performs the required mining tasks in real-time which is crucial for business continuity.

The cutting edge of this research is characterized by a recognition of the crucial importance of information and, specifically, ICTs to cities' positions in the current Knowledge Economy. This chapter builds on recent ""cyberspace"" analyses of the global urban system by arguing for, and demonstrating empirically, the value of Web search engine data as a means of understanding cities as situated within, and constituted by, flows of digital information. To this end, the authors show how the Google search engine can be used to specify a dynamic, informational classification of North American cities based on both the production and the consumption of Web information about two prominent current issues global in scope: the global financial crisis, and global climate change. © 2014, IGI Global.",

Raghavan S.,Reboot Systems: bridging digital divide – the green way,2013,"Subject area: Emerging markets – marketing and business strategy; social entrepreneurship; opportunity identification; frugal innovation. Study level/applicability: MBA; marketing management; specialis ed courses such as entrepreneurship and international marketing. Data rich case, but analytical difficulty is only moderate. Case overview: Reboot Systems was conceived as a reverse engineering/refurbishing company for used computers when Rahul Chowdhury and Subbarao came in contact with Anand Tater who had started a small business in the used computer market. The team recognised the potential of the refurbished computer market in India, which was largely unorganised with penetration of personal computers pegged at less than 5 per cent. They identified the opportunity to address the digital divide, caused by lack of affordability and accessibility, by providing inexpensive “as good as new” used computers to those who aspired to own a computer. Additionally, in extending the life of used computers on a large-scale through “frugal innovation”, they hoped to reduce the extent of e-waste generated in the economy. This case provides a rich description of an emerging market characterised by market heterogeneity, social-political governance with poor policy measures, unorganised markets, chronic shortage of resources and inadequate infrastructure. Entrepreneurs hoping to address social issues must tackle these problems at the grass-root level and come up with improvised solutions that address the unique needs of the heterogeneous and resource constrained market. Some of Reboot Systems pressing challenges were in building a viable strategic approach to the market and ensuring scalability in a sustainable way. Expected learning outcomes: An understanding of the characteristics of an emerging market from a macro (environmental) as well as micro (industry specific) perspective, an appreciation of opportunity identification and improvisation in emerging markets as well as differentiating “frugal” innovation from the idea of “Jugaad”, an understanding of the role of strategic vision and mission in accomplishing social and business objectives, an understanding of how to develop sustainability and competitive advantage from a social as well as business perspective.

O'Donnell T.,"It really is all about the data, and then some",2013,"Information On Demand (IOD) 2013 in Las Vegas, Nevada, told a different, very compelling story. Volumes of customer use cases; business partner testimonials; EXPO demonstrations; research, statistics, and test results;and technology enhancement announcements contributed to a palpable air of significant business and IT transformation that is fueling innovation in a new economy. One eye-opening example was an evening debate at a 'birds-of-a-feather' session on whether data is an asset for enterprises and organizations. It developed into a spirited discussion highlighting several insightful and philosophical viewpoints. Some supported the view that data alone did not constitute any real value beyond the cost of the storage it resided on and the real value was the delivery or usage of the information gleaned from the data. Others believed that data repositories do in fact have real value just like facilities, hardware, and other physical assets.",
"Chan Y.E., Dixon J.A., Dukelow C.R.",Revitalizing rural economies: A guide for practitioners,2013,"Rural communities in Canada are facing a new reality where traditional economic bases such as agriculture, forestry, and manufacturing have eroded. The digital divide, whereby rural Canada lags in access to broadband, has created further barriers to participating in the emerging knowledge economy. Revitalizing Rural Economies offers practical tools for developers, business people, and community leaders. The result of a partnership between the Monieson Centre at Queen's School of Business and entrepreneurs, policy makers, economic development officials, and elected representatives from rural communities across southern Ontario, Revitalizing Rural Economies draws on four years of community-based research to provide strategies for economic revitalization. Integrating case studies and community development guidelines, the authors explore themes such as the building blocks for community economic development (CED), innovation, community assets, vibrant downtowns, social capital accumulation through collaboration and inclusion, and new opportunities for rural economies through creative and value-added businesses. Designed as a practical guide, this book serves as a primer to CED, while also allowing those familiar with the field to delve deeper. Case studies ground the discussion in the challenges and opportunities facing communities.

Ramsay B.,Catalysing regional business development through high speed broadband: Opportunities and risks,2013,"This chapter explores the effect of the National Broadband Network (NBN) rollout on regional businesses. Research conducted in Tasmania by Inovact Consulting on how regional businesses are responding to broadband access provides illustrations of these opportunities and challenges being played out in the context of an increasingly interconnected global economy. The first part of the chapter examines the opportunities and challenges that the rollout of the NBN presents to regional businesses. The research shows that broadband technology can increase internal efficiencies and harness business growth, grant geographically isolated businesses access to global supply chains and enable innovations that make entering the export market more viable. The second part of this chapter outlines the need for businesses to initially regard the access to high speed broadband as a shock to their operating environment, and to prepare a strategy that views its advent as having potentially disruptive effects. However, once a strategy is in place to preserve and stabilise the company, it can then adopt a forward-thinking strategy for optimal leveraging of opportunities in the digital economy. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

"Valentine E.L.H., Stewart G.",The emerging role of the Board of Directors in enterprise business technology governance,2013,"In an increasingly business technology (BT) dependent world, the impact of the extraordinary changes brought about by the nexus of mobile and cloud technologies, social media and big data is increasingly being felt in the board room. As leaders of enterprises of every type and size, board directors can no longer afford to ignore, delegate or avoid BT-related decisions. Competitive, financial and reputational risk is increased if boards fail to recognize their role in governing technology as an asset and in removing barriers to improving enterprise business technology governance (EBTG). Directors' awareness of the need for EBTG is increasing. However, industry research shows that board level willingness to rectify the gap between awareness and action is very low or non-existent. This literature review-based research identifies barriers to EBTG effectiveness. It provides a practical starting point for board analysis. We offer four outcomes that boards might focus on to ensure the organizations they govern are not left behind by those led by the upcoming new breed of technology-savvy leaders. Most extant research looks backward for examples, examining data pre-2010, the time when a tipping point in the personal and business use of multimedia and mobile internet devices significantly deepened the impacts of the identified nexus technology forces, and began rapidly changing the way in which many businesses engage with their customers, employees and stakeholders. We situate our work amidst these nexus forces, discuss the board's role in EBTG in this context and modernize current definitions of enterprise technology governance. The primary limitation faced is the lack of scholarly research relating to EBTG in the rapidly changing digital economy. Although we have used recent (2011-2013) industry surveys, the volume of these surveys and congruence across them is significant in terms of levels of increased awareness and calls for increased board attention and competency in EBTG and strategic information use. Where possible, we have used scholarly research to illustrate or discuss industry findings. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.",board EBTG competencies; enterprise business technology governance (EBTG); strategic information orientation; technology governance risk
Clare K.,"The essential role of place within the creative industries: Boundaries, networks and play",2013,"This paper examines the role of place and spatial boundaries for the creative industries. Evidence from interviews with 70 workers in the advertising industry in London reveals the importance of geographical clustering for workers in this sector despite the potential of digital technologies. Creative firms are embedded in place, where the importance of urban aesthetics and social networks leads to tight geographic clustering. The aim of this paper is (i) to explore how and why geography matters for workers in the 'new' or 'changing' economy and (ii) how this creates a shared identity between creative workers. The article concludes that despite technological breakthroughs that have caused the death of distance, it turns out that geography is still important. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Boundaries; Creative workers; Place; Proximity; Social networks

However, the benefits of using the traditional museum to inspire visitors and promote the local economy may be compromised in the digital museum. This study attempts to offer insights on digital museum adoption from user and system perspectives. We extended the technology acceptance model (TAM) by incorporating computer self-efficacy and personal innovativeness as individual variables and media richness as a system characteristic. We launched a full-scale study with 441 users of 3 weather museums in Taiwan. We had 327 valid responses, a 74% response rate, from our target population. We conducted a regression analysis to investigate the potential influence of independent variables on the adoption of digital museums. Our results showed that both user and system characteristics have a positive influence on perceived usefulness (PU). A proper consideration of these three constructs can increase a user's PU and perceived ease of use (PEOU), thereby establishing a more positive attitude regarding the use of digital museums. Academic and practical implications concerning their adoption from user and system perspectives were drawn from these findings.",Computer self-efficacy; Digital museum; Media richness; Perceived ease of use; Personal innovativeness
Wittel A.,Counter-commodification: The economy of contribution in the digital commons,2013,"This is an article about digital production and the crisis of capitalism. It is about production in the digital commons and its implications for the building of alternatives to a commodified world. As digital production is at the very heart of cognitive capitalism, the digital commons is not just any other disruption of the process of commodification. This is the field of a fierce struggle over the future of the Internet and the future of capitalism itself. It is potentially the moment which moves back the frontiers of measurement, value and quantification towards qualities, values and an expansion of the gift economy. For this potential to unfold, it is vital that those who are giving, sharing, and contributing for the benefit of humanity are supported by global policies that enable them to do so. They have to be supported because their gifts are not based on reciprocity and the obligation to return the gift. This is an argument about the future of digital labour. The article concludes that this could be achieved through a global basic income scheme. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",commodification; digital commons; digital technologies; gift; labour; political economy

It presents broadband as increasingly necessary for the delivery of information, health, education, business, social security, public and leisure services. Access to broadband has become vital for rural communities to participate in a progressively digital economy and to overcome problems of physical and social isolation. Yet rural areas are among those most excluded from fast broadband developments. Although this is partly due to technological/economic barriers in reaching more remote locations, even where technology is available, adoption can still be low in rural areas. This article explores the problems of providing broadband in rural Britain, considers various technological approaches and concludes with key development areas for policy and government. © The Author(s) 2013 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.",broadband; broadband adoption; digital divide; economic; economy; inclusion; isolation; rural; rural development; social
"Cardona M., Kretschmer T., Strobel T.",ICT and productivity: Conclusions from the empirical literature,2013,"Innovation drives economic competitiveness and sustained long-term economic growth. Especially the emergence and intensive utilization of information and communication technologies (ICTs), which spawned the beginning of the digital economy two decades ago, heavily affected the opportunities and efficiency of how firms produce and provide goods and services. We provide an overview of the empirical literature on ICT and productivity and highlight the main results and methodological differences. The majority of studies indicates that the productivity effect of ICT is indeed positive and significant. However, methodological approaches of how to appropriately estimate the ICT effect matter. While aggregate and sectoral growth accounting exercises suggest stronger differences of the ICT effect between US and Europe, firm-level analyses suggest no significant country differences. Moreover, we shed light on the notion of ICT being a General Propose Technology (GPT) enabling further innovations. Most of the GPT evidence on ICT is found for the US, while evidence for European countries is harder to come by. However, more theoretical and empirical research is needed to better understand spillovers and externalities of ICT and how these technologies transform our economies. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",General purpose technology; Growth accounting; Information and communication technologies; Productivity

"Meng Y., Shapira P., Tang L.",The emergence of science-driven entrepreneurship in China: A case study of technological innovation in nano-pigment inks,2013,"All countries face challenges in commercialising scientific advances in emerging technology domains. As an emerging economy, China is rapidly evolving its innovation system, but still faces many issues in linking scientific development with industrial applications. While research and development (R&D) investment in Chinese science has increased significantly in recent years, there are substantial lags and barriers in the deployment of new technology knowledge by business, including by small and medium-sized enterprises. Yet, there are important signs of change within research organisations and in the policy support structures for research commercialisation in China. To explore these developments, this study examines a specific case within the domain of nanotechnology, an emerging technology domain where China is now among the world's biggest R&D performers. We investigate an example in China of science-driven entrepreneurship in a new technology for producing nano-pigment inks for digital inkjet textile printing. The contextual conditions and the development and commercialisation processes of this focal technology are analysed, as we examine the strategies used by the research team to spin-off their research towards commercialisation. We identify key factors in the Chinese innovation system that respectively facilitated and hindered this research commercialisation example, and consider managerial and policy implications raised by the case.

Foord J.,The new boomtown? Creative city to Tech City in east London,2013,"This paper presents an initial analysis of a creative digital cluster which emerged in east London in the immediate aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Drawing on spatial analysis of sector and firm level data, the eastward trajectory of a new wave of digital creative activity, and its particular mix of co-located sectors, is placed within the wider context of the geography of London's creative and digital economies. The particular dynamics of this cluster - its sector combinations, markets and firm organisation - are creating a localised spike of economic vitality. The relative strength of this new cluster is contrasted with the faltering position of longstanding local craft and arts based creative industries. Analysis of a sample of 261 firms suggests that the current vitality of this cluster emerges from risky experimentation across co-located sectors in which hitherto unrelated knowledges and activities are being combined. A core role for hybrid firms - creative digital agencies - is suggested. These firms show many of characteristics already identified for creative SMEs, including their tendency to agglomerate in and benefit from specialised clusters within urban economies. However, these firms also appear to have internalised the sector and skill diversity commonly identified as the primary positive externalities of urban economies. It is also noted that this self-organising creative digital cluster is producing spatially embedded 'noisy' networks with a multitude of weak ties. This cluster arrangement appears therefore to be a mechanism for mediating the high degrees of uncertainty and risk in London's creative digital sector, currently exacerbated by the recessionary conditions of London's post 2008 economy. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Creative clusters; Creative digital; Digital Shoreditch; East London; Tech City

Daniel R.,Enterprise learning in Australasian tertiary music education: The status quo,2013,"The creative industries is recognized as one of the fastest growing sectors of the global economy. Music, and the industry sector built around this discipline of creative practice, is a major part of the creative industries and contributor to global experience economies. The music sector is broad, diverse and complex, indeed it has arguably become increasingly so as a result of the explosion in digital and web 2.0 environments. In addition, within the literature there are ongoing references to the particular challenges associated with securing viable and consistent employment in the music sector and regardless of musical style. As a result, there is ongoing debate in the tertiary sector in relation to if and how educators should respond to the arguments for business, entrepreneurial and/or enterprise learning within undergraduate music curricula. This chapter therefore reports on an analysis of current undergraduate music programs in Australasia in terms of the extent to which they focus on the development of entrepreneurial or enterprise skills. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.

McCarthy B.,The landscape of music festivals in Australia,2013,"The landscape of festivals in Australia is a diverse one, ranging from large urban festivals to small, community-based rural festivals. Music, in all its forms, has the potential to contribute social, financial and artistic capital to a community. This chapter seeks to explore the human needs fulfilled by music and understand why such festivals and events have become so popular with policy makers and researchers alike. The chapter is organised as follows. Firstly, the universal appeal of music is explained by drawing on academic concepts of emotion, authenticity, experiential consumption, fandom, subcultures and identity. Secondly the concept of a festival is explored, their cultural value is highlighted and a profile of music festivals in Australasia is given. Recent studies strongly suggest that the number, diversity, and popularity of festivals have grown spectacularly over the past several decades. Thirdly, the commodification of music in modern times is described and the ramifications of festivals for local economies, tourism development and the natural environment are explored. Finally, conclusions are drawn about the future of music festivals in the light of the digital age. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013. All rights are reserved.",
"Miranda L.C.M., Lima C.A.S.",Technology substitution and innovation adoption: The cases of imaging and mobile communication markets,2013,"Technology substitution and innovation adoption are considered within the framework of evolutionary economy. The evolution hierarchical concepts of change, order, direction, progress and perfectibility are invoked to describe technological substitutions as processes that point towards the direction the economic system moves into, its rate of change giving the speed of change. Knowledge evolution and its appropriation into technological innovation are key ingredients in enhancing competition among technologies struggling towards capturing the other's market shares. We accordingly mathematically translate these evolutionary views into practice using Lotka-Volterra prey-predator model for competition and single logistic growth for the market evolution of the competing innovation. Using this formulation we studied the technological substitution of analog by digital imaging process and demonstrate how the later has disruptively displaced the former. Considering its vital importance to managing market strategies towards innovation products adoption, we redefine the takeoff time with a more realistic accounting of the innovation product adoption by consumers that is easily computed from its launching phase sales data. Our takeoff time is found to occur earlier than the one usually adopted. The new formulation is successfully tested against the consolidated innovation adoption of two economically impacting technological innovations: digital cameras and mobile phones. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",Digital cameras; Digital imaging; Evolutionary economy; Innovation adoption; Logistic modeling; Lotka-Volterra modeling; Mobile phones; Takeoff time; Technological substitution
"Edgington D., Hayter R.",The In Situ Upgrading of Japanese Electronics Firms in Malaysian Industrial Clusters,2013,"The ability of clusters generated by direct foreign investment (DFI) in emerging economies to generate sustained, value-added growth is a matter of controversy. This article assesses this debate with reference to the role of Japanese electronics multinational corporations (MNCs) in the development of clusters in Malaysia. Conceptually, we present a typology of DFI-generated industrial clusters that represent increasing degrees of commitment to local value creation and upgrading. Empirically, we conducted a survey of 10 Japanese firms in Malaysia that examined whether or not their factories increased technological upgrading, increasingly embedded their operations through using local skilled labor and supply firms, and responded positively to national policies and cluster-governance measures supporting the electronics industry. We found that Japanese firms had clearly moved beyond simple assembly-based to embedded clustering but had not progressed further to technology-intensive behavior because of the poor technological environment in Malaysia, as well as Japanese MNCs' strategies that depend on technology from headquarters. Nonetheless, Japanese MNCs were sufficiently embedded in Malaysia to upgrade production to digital consumer products, and semiconductor assembly has flourished, warding off competition from China and low-cost locations in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. At the end of the study period, Malaysia remained an attractive location for Japanese electronics MNCs. © 2013 Clark University.",Electronics sector; Industrial clusters; Japanese multinational corporations; Malaysia

Drawing on the thesis of immaterial labour this chapter explores how these new forms of informational work e.g. information aggregation systems for accessing the judgments of many minds, the distribution of digital free, and opportunities for the co-production of information goods, have emerged to valorise the cultural content of the commodity. The chapter begins by introducing the topic of information goods, and by identifying the main tenets of immaterial labour. This is followed by a discussion of these new forms of informational work within the context of proprietary and non-proprietary information production.

Carter D.,"Urban Regeneration, Digital Development Strategies and the Knowledge Economy: Manchester Case Study",2013,"In the late twentieth century, cities like Manchester, seen as the 'original, modern' [1] world industrial city, faced serious challenges in terms of how to respond to the massive economic restructuring that was taking place. On the one hand, Manchester needed to respond to the highest rates of unemployment and social exclusion seen for more than 50 years, whilst, at the same time, the city wanted to develop innovative and practical solutions which could bring real economic and social benefits to local people. The impact of even more rapid technological change, referred to as the emerging 'information society', which started to impact from the 1980s onwards, exacerbated this dilemma, accelerating the process of restructuring so that within urban areas new economic growth increasingly sat side by side with extremes of poverty, unemployment and other forms of social exclusion. This case study looks at the ways that Manchester, and key players from the city region, including the public sector, business, education and the community sector, responded to this and how those responses over the past 25+ years created new ambitions and aspirations for the city and its citizens. The conclusions focus on the concept of the 'Smart City' and Manchester's ideas on creating a more inclusive, creative and sustainable city, including through the imaginative use of digital technologies, applications and services, and a commitment to open innovation and the co-production of new and innovative services. © 2012 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of United Kingdom.",Co-production; Creativity; Inclusion; Open innovation; Smart cities; Sustainable city
Edoho F.M.,Information and communications technologies in the age of globalization: Challenges and opportunities for Africa,2013,"This paper aims to examine the challenges and opportunities for implementing ICTs in Africa. It identifies potential areas that ICTs can be targeted and implemented for maximum in the region, and offers an integrated framework that could help the region to coordinate various components and institutionalize ICTs in the economy. It is argued that Africa needs an integrated approach to leverage ICTs for socioeconomic development. The paper reviews African theoretical perspectives of ICTs. Synthesizing literature on African perspectives of ICTs, an integrated framework is developed to help provide a coherent focus for the implementation of ICTs in a holistic manner. Basic systems for leveraging ICTs for development in Africa are fragmented and uncoordinated. Critical physical infrastructure and human capacity do not work synergistically to effectively implement ICTs. Where the basic infrastructure exists, various components do not operate synergistically to engender optimal results. Ideas formulated in this study will be helpful to future researchers relative to how various ICT components could be systematized and managed to stimulate sustainable socioeconomic development and structural changes in Africa. The framework will help to guide policymakers to design and implement ICT-friendly policies and strategies.

"Lange B., Bürkner H.-J.",Value Creation in Scene-based Music Production: The Case of Electronic Club Music in Germany,2013,"The focus of this article is on the variability of value creation in the popular music industry. Recent trends in electronic music have been based on both the valorization of global tastes and of local specialities in performance and production. Depending on musical styles and market niches, local scenes have become important forces behind heterogeneous ""globalocal"" markets. At the same time, technological change and the virtualization of music production and distribution contribute to increasingly differentiated configurations of value creation. It is therefore necessary to reconstruct theoretically and empirically the new interplay among the local music production, digital media markets, and virtual communities that are involved. On the basis of empirical explorations in a German hot spot of electronic club-music production (the city of Berlin), the article indentifies local interaction practice and constellations of stakeholders. The findings show that value creation in these rapidly changing production scenes has moved away from the large-scale distribution of producer-induced media to audience-induced live performance and interactive soundtrack production. This change involves the rising importance of cultural embeddings such as taste building, reputation building among artists and producers, and local community building. Starting from an open theoretical problematization of value creation with regard to fluid scenes and shifting modes of production, the results of first empirical reconstructions are taken as inputs to an evolving discussion on the configurations of value creation in consumer-based strands of music production. © 2012 Clark University.",Berlin; Creative economy; Music industry; Value chain; Value creation

Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and the Internet are not equally spread around places and this heterogeneity affects spatial configuration. Despite the wide societal changes due to ICTs and the extensive interest in accessibility studies, these two themes have not yet come together in order to study the digital accessibility (DA) of places. Adopting an infrastructural perspective and a potential accessibility framework, a DA measure - embedding different types of impedance distance functions - is calculated for cities in Europe. Spatial Interaction Model and Complex Network Analysis are employed to calibrate and validate the DA results. The outcome of this approach is a new urban hierarchy which reveals a core-periphery pattern in Europe owing to digital accessibility. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Digital accessibility; Impedance functions; Internet geography; Potential accessibility
"Dobusch L., Quack S.","Framing standards, mobilizing users: Copyright versus fair use in transnational regulation",2013,"Following the agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) intellectual property rights, and more specifically copyright, have become the subject of highly politicized conflicts. In this paper we analyze how these conflicts shifted from the political arena to private standard-setting sites, where two opposing coalitions of actors pursued competing initiatives - an industry coalition which aimed at enforcing copyright protection through Digital Rights Management and an emerging coalition of civil society actors which sought to develop a digital commons based on copyleft licenses. Paradoxically, the industry coalition, which had very successfully lobbied international organizations, ran into trouble developing and enforcing private regulation in the market place, while the civil society coalition proved to be more effective in the market than in the political sphere. The findings of our analysis indicate that the strategic use of organizational forms and collective action frames can be more decisive for the mobilization of users than material resources, and that the success of collective action frames depends on their compatibility with user practices. Based on the argument that regime shifting from intergovernmental to private governance can open up new and favorable spaces for weak actors to experiment with alternative forms of regulation, the paper contributes to the literature on the politics of regime complexity. The paper furthermore highlights the importance of studying non-elite actors and their day-to-day practices to gain a better understanding of changes within the international political economy. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",framing; implementation politics; intellectual property regulation; International regime complexity; mobilization; standards
"Lopez V.W.B., Esteves J.",Acquiring external knowledge to avoid wheel re-invention,2013,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze the underlying characteristics that enable the acquisition and appropriation of external knowledge, paying special attention to the relationship between external and internal networks to support this process. Design/methodology/approach: A case study methodology is followed, using not only semi-structured interviews but also secondary data to triangulate the obtained information. For the interviews, the authors have considered not only employees in different strategic positions, from middle management to top management, but also participants in the main supplier, to obtain a holistic perspective of the knowledge acquisition and appropriation in the innovation process. Findings: For the improvements of the process of knowledge acquisition and appropriation, organizations should configure internal and external networks to support this process reorganizing their classical structures. Moreover, this process is enhanced by the support of top managers and innovation champions, which act as sponsors and facilitators of the project respectively, to ensure that the whole process runs smoothly. At the end, to deal with new kinds of projects that are completely different to previous ones, it is recommended to be open to new ways of organizing and structuring participants; hence, coordination and socialization mechanisms are important to reach not only potential absorptive capacity (associated with knowledge acquisition) but also realized absorptive capacity (associated with knowledge exploitation). This situation is even more relevant in Web 2.0 environments, where each participant has autonomy to participate actively, be just a passive participant, or cease to belong to the community. Practical implications: The paper's findings could be useful to identify the determinants of knowledge acquisition and appropriation because they could guide organizations in the development of external and internal networks to support this process, which would be used to promote innovation within the organization; and with this identification, organizations could take actions based on their organizational requirements and goals. It is important to note that organizational boundaries are shifting from being closed to be permeable, enabling a better interaction with key partners and facilitating the knowledge exchange. However, this situation offers new challenges for organizations that want to be leaders in the near future because traditional organizations should shift their old paradigms, having an organizational culture more aligned with Web 2.0 philosophy (e.g. collaboration and sharing), which is the paradigm of the new digital economy. Originality/value: This study is a step forward to understand the relationship between external and internal networks that act as enablers of knowledge acquisition and appropriation. The authors extend the knowledge-based view by applying it in a Web 2.0 context, highlighting coordination and socialization mechanisms as critical success factors to integrate internal and external knowledge.

The ICT industry will be among the hardest hit, as Canadian employers will need to hire more than 17,000 ICT workers per year until 2016 in order to meet labour demand. These trends will be compounded by the pending retirement of large segments of the baby boomer generation over the next decade. Domestic labour supply is necessary but insufficient to meet these ongoing demands. Despite the growing pressures for more immigrants, the Canadian government has identified a strong need to balance provincial and territorial demands with the prevailing socio-economic outcomes of recent immigrants, which are well below the Canadian average. Reasons for the declining labour market outcomes of Canadian IEPs are provided, as well as potential solutions for improving their economic integration. Based on the success of Australia's immigration system, as well as other factors, we conclude by presenting a theoretical model for immigration that combines both supply-driven and demand-driven programs and suggest why this hybrid approach can improve the labour market not only for immigrants, but for Canada as a whole. © Common Ground, Sam Bourgi, All Rights Reserved.",Canadian Immigrants; Digital Economy; Global Competition; Global Talent; ICT Sector; Immigration; Innovation; Internationally Educated Professionals; Knowledge Economy; Labour Shortage; Outsourcing; Skills Shortage; Soft Skills; Workforce Development
"Preston P., Rogers J.","Convergence, crisis and the digital music economy",2013,"In this chapter we consider the concept of convergence in the context of the complex relationships unfolding between technology, socio-economic factors and the contemporary music industry—the ‘canary down the mine’ of the digital media industries. We observe that when it comes to the music industry, technology convergence trends have generally been defined in rather negative terms. In essence, they are generally represented in terms of a fundamental ‘crisis’ especially for the recorded music sub-sector. Here, we move on to critically interrogate the conventional wisdom that implies technological trends and convergences are leading to some sort of fundamental decay or decline in the power and role of the music industry. Instead, we propose that whilst the initial disruptive effects of the radical new digital technologies may have induced a certain ‘crisis’ for the prevailing models and practices of the recorded music industry, these have also prompted and been accompanied by new opportunities for restructuring and reshaping of the sector’s scope and operations. We draw upon the concept of convergence to guide our study of a music industry that is widely perceived as a leading site for new media developments. We question the extent to which the music industry is experiencing transformations or significant disruptions resulting from technological innovations, or whether it is actually much more a case of ‘business as usual’ in the commercial music industry. Thus this chapter proposes to interrogate and challenge the dominant framing of current debates around the notion of ‘crisis’ in the music industry. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.",
Carter E.V.,Anatomy of a Scan: Digital Market Intelligence and Economic Literacy in the MBA Curriculum,2013,"This pilot study examined an innovative rubric designed to overcome the deficiencies of present environmental scanning frameworks. The Anatomy of a Scan rubric resolves two problems associated with environmental scanning instruction. First, the need for simpler rubric designs with familiar formats arises because digital knowledge economy intelligence exceeds the capabilities of existing scanning rubrics, given business education course delivery constraints. Second, the need for improved economic information literacy arises because knowledge economy dynamics expand the breadth and depth of digital market intelligence. By using economic market intelligence to anchor environmental scanning, the anatomy rubric improves students’ strategic focus with conceptual advantages and raises economic literacy with empirical application. © 2013, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",business education; cognitive rubric; digital intelligence; economic literacy; environmental scanning; knowledge economy; market intelligence; strategic planning

"Savic N., Radojicic Z.",Measuring the digital divide in the field of e-Government,2013,"This paper considers a topic of monitoring and evaluation of e-Government, focusing on a phenomenon known as digital divide that may exist in this field. Measuring a level of digital divide is especially important for decision makers, who are in a position to create or correct strategies for synchronized development and use of e-Government services, with respect to different entities like countries, populations, economies or companies. We investigate the size of digital divide in the context of applying different e-Government modules within monitored entities, divided into relevant groups. After defining one model for measuring different types of digital divide in e-Government usage, the model is applied on the case of Serbia, calculating sub-indices and the compound e-Government polarization index - EGPI. The model is a flexible and opened system that allows easy changes of its basic input parameters. This means that its semantic does not change when the set of sub-indices, the set of indicators for its quantitative expression and/or a division of objects into groups within a certain type of digital divide are changed. At the same time, all calculations are performed according to the same rules defined by the model. The paper contains both the theoretical part, and an empirical quantitative research. The results of this research elaborate on the actual level of polarization in acceptance of e-Government modules within enterprises in Serbia. Also, these results emphasize risk groups of enterprises that should receive special attention in the future, in order to minimize digital divide in usage of e-Government. © The Authors, 2013.",Digital divide; e-Government; E-government polarization index EGPI; Information society; Measuring digital divide

Pardo A.,Digital hollywood: How Internet and social media are changing the movie business,2013,"The history of Hollywood runs in tandem with the history of technological development. The inclusion of sound, followed by that of color, along with the need to adapt to new audiovisual media (television and video), are milestones in the history of the largest entertainment factory in the world. Each of these forms of technological development in turn marked a growing pain or turning point at the time of its invention, by which the Hollywood industry was ultimately strengthened. However, the changes over the last ten years have been both more fast-paced and more far-reaching than anything that came before. The digital revolution and globalization have transformed the film and TV industry in ways which could never have been foreseen. The big Hollywood studios have been forced to respond to the uncertainty-and potential for profit-prompted by the popularity of the Internet and the success of new digital platforms, especially among young people. This article is an attempt to trace the framework of present and future challenges facing the entertainment industry, as a step forward in relation to previous researches. First, I will examine the defining features of the emerging consumer profile and address the most significant elements of the new digital economy, epitomized by the “long tail market” model. Secondly, I will described the Hollywood reaction to this new digital scenario and discuss on the business models adopted by major American studios in relation to the downloading of films and TV programs. Thirdly, I will approach the substantial changes in the movie value chain. Finally, I will draw some concluding remarks to frame the changing physiognomy of the entertainment industry and the search for the right business strategies. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.",
Deshmukh N.P.,Leveraging BPM decipline to deliver agile business processes in emerging markets,2013,"Over past few years Emerging Markets have contributed significantly to the Global Economic Growth, outpacing their developed counterparts. Strong economic growth in emerging markets underpins the new opportunities for businesses. These Markets are characterized by demographic advantage, dense population, and large magnitude of consumption, high growth and potential risks due to evolving nature of Governance &amp; Regulations. Consumers, in Emerging Markets are at the cross roads with Digital Revolution and Financial and Social inclusion. Adaptation of these aspects to penetrate through multilayered consumer base demands Agile Business Processes to successfully render products and services in rapidly evolving emerging economies. This paper identifies basic elements of Business Process Agility and it's co-relation with Business Process Capability Maturity. It then recommends how an integrated approach to Process Engineering and Technology adoption of BPM can lead to agile business processes.

Rotondo S.A.,PERUWOOD: The digital video industry in Peru [PERUWOOD: La industria del video digital en el Perú],2013,"This article studies the expansion of digital technologies in Peru, one of the emerging economies of South America. I suggest that the arrival of VCD and DVD technologies has provoked a rampant increase of audiovisual piracy and, at the same time, the development of a video industry controlled by a popular social sector separate from mainstream institutions. The productive base of this industry is composed of formal-sector microenterprises dedicated to recording and selling videos with local content, as well as appealing to low-income market segments. Distribution is realized mainly though piracy networks. It is clear that digital technologies facilitate the democratization of production, commercialization, and consumption of audiovisual media. These technologies enlarge the opportunities for circulation of audio visual content different from European and North American tastes and aesthetic canons and have fostered the appearance of open business models that do not depend on authors' rights to accumulate capital. © 2013 by the Latin American Studies Association.",

Champion K.,Problematizing a homogeneous spatial logic for the creative industries: The case of the digital games industry,2013,"The computer games industry can be regarded, in many ways, as a paradigmatic sector of the creative economy. It has been firmly on the policy agenda in the United Kingdom since New Labour’s election in 1997 and, in particular, since 1998 with the inclusion of digital games as a sub- sector of creative industries as defined by the Creative Industries Task Force. Its high public profile has been justified by claims of economic weight and potential externalities (DCMS, 2012a; TIGA, 2012). As well as a belief that the sector can provide direct benefits to the economy, it is suggested that it also provides additional advantages through a multiplier effect and can even ameliorate the impact of the recent recession. In terms of policy interventions aimed at fostering growth within the computer games industry, many efforts have taken a spatially targeted focus including the funding and development of hubs and clusters. The rationale for this attention rests on a belief that the sector has a particular spatial logic in common with the wider creative industries, which preferences proximity and is subject to advantages of agglomeration. Despite a paucity of empirical research specifically reviewing the spatial rationale of the computer games sector, significant work has been undertaken to identify the location patterns within the wider creative economy. The existing research suggests that the creative industries have a dominant spatial rationale which tends to favour co- location, and that large metropolitan centres act as natural hubs of activity, but there remain gaps in the evidence base. © Sabine Hotho and Neil McGregor 2013 and Respective authors 2013.",
Hotho S.,‘Some companies are fine one day and gone the next’: Sustaining business in the digital games industry,2013,"While the overall global economic outlook since 2007 has remained pessimistic, the computer games industry continues to display remarkable resilience. In November 2012, for instance, NPD Group, reporting a 22 per cent year- on- year sales growth in digital games in the US market, described this industry as the only bright spot in an otherwise depressed economy. With its offering of affordable, easy- to- access entertainment and a still relatively youthful customer base, few industries seem to be as capable of recession proofing as the games industry. Constant technology updates and innovations diversify opportunities for development and routes to market, and consequently offer ever more opportunities for new enterprises. The industry’s growth trajectory remains exceptional as technological advances relating to platforms, their capacities and functionalities, and their potential for compatibility remain unpredictable (ParisTechReview, 2012). © Sabine Hotho and Neil McGregor 2013 and Respective authors 2013.",

Pfeffermann N.,Innovation communication as an integrative management capability in digital innovation ecosystems,2013,"Dynamics in communication and innovation environments, such as new online communication channels, new corporate innovation tools, and access to and availability of information via digital technologies world-wide, are catalysts for the expanding interest of communication as an underpinning success factor in innovation management. From a theoretical perspective, the literature, however, has not fully acknowledged management of innovation communication as a new management function in corporate communication and has fallen short of comprehensively explaining the How? of managing innovation communication as a strategic capability for effective idea generation to idea conversion in the open innovation economy. This chapter provides a new approach: Innovation communication as an integrative management capability from a strategic management perspective. After presenting a literature review on communicating innovations and corporate communication management, a new understanding of innovation communication as a dynamic capability from in corporate communication management research is provided. Second, the direct and indirect effects of innovation communication—as an integrative management capability—on company value are illustrated and propositions are set up to further develop theory.

"Riccaboni M., Rossi A., Schiavo S.",Global networks of trade and bits,2013,"Considerable efforts have been made in recent years to produce detailed topologies of the Internet, but so far these data have been overlooked by economists. In this paper, we suggest that such information could be used to characterize both the size of the digital economy and outsourcing at country level. We analyse the topological structure of the network of trade in digital services (trade in bits) and compare it with the more traditional flow of manufactured goods across countries. To perform meaningful comparisons across networks with different characteristics, we define a stochastic benchmark for the number of connections among each country-pair, based on hypergeometric distribution. Original data are filtered so that we only focus on the strongest, i. e. statistically significant, links. We find that trade in bits displays a sparser and less hierarchical network structure, which is more similar to trade in high-skill manufactured goods than total trade. Moreover, distance plays a more prominent role in shaping the network of international trade in physical goods than trade in digital services. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Distance; Hypergeometric; International trade; Internet; Network analysis; Outsourcing

With a growing number of ways for advertisers to market their products, the amount of competition against the newspaper publishing industry is escalating. While the economy has returned to slow growth, and business resources that were traditionally used on print advertising rebounded, less newspaper advertising space is available because print newspaper subscriptions have not recovered. Lower subscriptions also make newspaper ads less desirable to advertisers seeking to maximize their audience. Newspaper publishers are moving most of their content to digital platforms to maximize its value, publish news in real-time and retain tech-savvy readers.

Vukanovic Z.,Managing social media value networks: From publisher (broadcast) to user-centric (broadband-narrowcast) business models,2013,"The author argues that the media value networks in the twenty-first century have shifted from a traditional publisher (broadcast) to more innovative and digitally based user-centric (broadband-narrowcast) business models. Accordingly, in order to attain the sustainable competitive advantage of the user-centric business models media executives and companies are required to strategically adopt, implement and utilize increasingly interactive, mobile, wireless, pervasive, augmented, immersive, ubiquitous and digital business models of production, distribution as well as consumption. Furthermore the future of the media appears to be specifically oriented towards the establishment of networked, 3D, on-demand, broadband and unicast as well as multimedia and hypermedia models of distribution, communication and content creation. Thus, specific financial, technological, advertising, consumer and economic applications that need further implementations include: Micropayments; VoD, PPV-Pay-Per-View model, B2C and B2B marketing; 3D TV; sharing and usability of media content; mass personalization (customization) including more interactive and accessible as well as wireless and mobile user interfaces; long-tail economics; experience economy; market nicheization; tipping point; crowd sourcing; mesh company strategy; media content repurposing and UGC-User Generated Content (question-answer databases, digital video, blogging, podcasting, mobile phone photography and wikis). © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.",
Gambaro M.,"Some economics of new media content production and consumption, and strategic implication for media companies",2013,"This chapter discusses the economic condition of the content production for new digital platforms. I consider both entertainment and informative contents and the possible relationship with traditional media. News there is an obvious centre of interest since the whole society benefit from the dissemination activity of the media. On the economic side, in the market the benefit of the competition requires that every agent has access costless to relevant information, to prevent information rent for more informed part. On the same wave in democratic system only informed voters can monitor and eventually sanction politicians at the election. Technological innovations and redefinition of media landscape enable new entrants to unbundle traditional media contents and to offer specific information component to selected targets or general public. Therefore traditional cross-subsidiation patterns collapse and media organization need to evolve quickly in order to remain in the market. Declining production costs that characterize many information market reduce scale economies especially in new production organization making possible more flexible way to create and aggregate information contents. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.",
"Huang C.-C., Fan Y.-N., Chern C.-C., Yen P.-H.",Measurement of analytical knowledge-based corporate memory and its application,2013,"In the current knowledge-driven economy, businesses are increasingly required to function as knowledge-based organizations. In these organizations, knowledge usually serves as the means for attainment of competitive advantage. It is clear that organizational knowledge has to be carefully managed, and knowledge management measurement is important to businesses. In this paper, corporate memory (CM) is viewed as an organization memory for managing knowledge. Generically and concretely, CM is constructed using analytical knowledge (AK), which is defined as the knowledge formatted with 5W1H (who, when, where, what, why, and how). AK is extracted from data storage systems and domain experts by aggregating information, where data analysts, knowledge workers, and knowledge users are involved in a knowledge discovery process. The research objective of this study is to propose a measurement approach, which provides a generic and applicable methodology for measuring the performance and quality of CM. To represent the uncertainty and fuzzy terms in the evaluation environments, and to explicate the invisible impact induced by information technology (IT), the fuzzy set theory is applied. An effective procedure is also proposed to apply the measurement approach in practice. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Analytical knowledge; Corporate memory; Fuzzy set theory; Knowledge management; Measurement

"Chung K.C., Fleming P., Fleming E.",The impact of information and communication technology on international trade in fruit and vegetables in APEC,2013,"The global food marketing network is being constantly reshaped, providing opportunities and challenges for information and communication technology (ICT) to develop and improve international trade in food products. A gravity model of international trade is employed to see if ICT positively affects bilateral international trade in fruit and vegetables between member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) economies. We examine if the use of the Internet, mobile telephones, and fixed telephone lines determine the value of bilateral trade. Empirical results for the importance of ICT differ markedly between importing activities and exporting activities in the international value chain of fruit and vegetables in APEC countries. Changes in ICT levels in the import sector of the value chain have no effect on international trade in fruit and vegetables. However, in the export sector, growth in some ICT products has significant positive effects on trade in fruit and vegetables between APEC countries. Surprisingly, the strongest impact was discerned for the traditional form of ICT, fixed telephone lines, but this impact probably reflects the fact that fixed telephone lines are a proxy variable for the general level of infrastructure development. Of the two digital ICTs, mobile telephony and the Internet, only the Internet had a significant impact on trade levels. The further development of the Internet and its diffusion should make exporters in APEC countries more competitive in the fruit and vegetables value chain, and boost their trade values in these products. © 2013 Crawford School of Public Policy, The Australian National University and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.",

The digital divide is a barrier to achieving this goal because it expresses the inability to access, in their various forms, the benefits provided by information and communication technology and, ultimately, to access digital citizenship. The scope of the digital divide is significant between developing and developed economies, but alsoin areas with developed economies, as in the case of the European Union, where there is great diversity among the member countries. In the current global economic crisis, and specifically in Europe, some governments have promoted the idea that ICT is a strategic sector for growth and job creation -as stated by the EU Ministers responsible for the information society in the Granada Declaration of 19 April 2010. Following this guideline, Europe would reach a high level in the global digital economy, especially as regards theinformation technologies̀ market. At the same time, there is an inclusive policy aimed at a new European citizenship, in other wordsdigitally prepared and active users. Consequently and according to these principles, governments should commit more to this sector, extending its use and benefits to the general population, in order to improve both individual and collective life. However, despite these general guidelines, not all countries have addressed digital inclusion equally in both content and scope.

"Moatshe R.M., Mahmood Z.",Implementing eGovernment projects: Challenges facing developing countries,2012,"Globalisation of world societies, cultures, politics and economies is compelling countries world over to initiate and reinvent government systems to deliver efficient and effective services to citizens, businesses and other agencies. This transformation and reform in the way governments operate presents significant challenges and issues that developing countries need to fully take into account when implementing eGovernment projects. Governments in developing countries face challenges different from those in developed countries, challenges include amongst others; limited resources with competing national priority needs; lack of interoperability standards for build up of eGovernment systems; and limited and weak telecommunication platforms resulting into inaccessibility and poorinternet connections speed and efficiency. The potential for eGovernment in developing countries remains largely unexploited despitethat information and telecommunication technologies (ICTs) offers considerable potential for sustainable development of eGovernment. Developing countries in comparison to developed countries lack in (1) history and culture; (2) technical capabilities; (3) Infrastructure; (4) e-citizen development and (5) public service focus. There is digital divide between developed and developing countries, not withstanding that the world is in reality a one globally competitive market. Hence a need for eGovernment research specifically focused on developing countries. This paper takes both the theoretical and empirical approaches to address the study, a theoretical approach is used to explore and discuss the general challenges faced by developing countries with a view to create adequate awarenessof the challenges to give focus and enable developing countries to capture in their plans effective strategies to tackle these challenges when formulating implementation programmes. Whereas the empirical approach applies a case study based research conducted in Botswana mainly not to provide the solution at this point, but rather to highlight that though there are generic challenges facingdeveloping countries, there is however, no one size fits all solution as some challenges are peculiar and specific to countries and would need differentiated approaches and strategies. Further the paper discusses the present benefits of eGovernment to developing countries in three broader categories of; political and public sector administration benefits; economic benefits; and social and culturalbenefits. Presentation of how developing countries can benefit from implementing eGovernment projects coupled with awareness ofwhat challenges to address and specification of challenges per each country is expected to assist developing countries to set appropriategoals for pursuing eGovernment, define and set clear vision, mission and priorities for eGovernment as well as determine theeGovernment their nations may be ready for.",e-citizens; eGovernment; ICTS; Internet

"Lamari M., Belgacem I.",Knowledge brokering in the web 2.0 era: Empirical evidence of emerging strategies in government agencies,2012,"Over the last five years, knowledge brokering, a set of activities aimed at connecting producers and end users of knowledge, has emerged as one of the most influential good practices in knowledge use and innovation (1-2-3). As a learning organization, many public administrations and government agencies in Canada, as well as in other Western countries, have promoted knowledge brokering in order to reinforce knowledge utilization. In a similar vein, smart digital technologies, mainly Web 2.0 platforms, become increasingly a new user-friendly vehicle to identify, acquire, transform and exploit new knowledge and information. Despite the presence of more research stressing the importance of knowledge brokering, mainly in the public health sector [1-2], little is still known about knowledge brokers, their profession or their day-to-day activities, particularly in regard to their use of Web 2.0 technologies. This article goes beyond rhetoric and hermeneutic analyses on this subject to draw an empirical and factual overview of emerging practices and strategies in knowledge brokering, within government agencies. In this vein, our investigation is based on a survey developed for this purpose and carried out among a representative sampling of knowledge brokers (n=106) operating within Québec government agencies, well known for their widespread use of Web 2.0 platforms and digital innovation. © 2012 IEEE.",Canada; digital economy; e-learning; knowledge brokering; knowledge sharing; knowledge transfer; Web 2.0

Bold M.R.,The rights and wrongs of operational practices in the scottish publishing industry,2012,"Digital publishing has been considered as a panacea to bridge the gaps between different sized publishing companies: allowing small, independent companies to compete on an equal footing with cross-media conglomerates. However, this research discovered that Scottish publishers are not capitalising on new technology and new platforms for dissemination: this is detrimental to the authors they represent. The empirical research found that the majority of Scottish publishers are not fostering intellectual property rights (IPR) effectively across international markets and new media: The failure to do this means that the operational practices of the Scottish publishing industry are not in harmony with the burgeoning digital publishing environment. If Scottish publishers continue with current practices it will become increasingly difficult for them to compete in the national and international publishing environment. This study concludes that only by better training and knowledge exchange, in matters of rights exploitation and digital publishing, can Scottish publishers compete in the international arena and contribute to, and benefit financially from, the knowledge economy. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2012.",Copyright; Digital publishing; IPR; Scotland; Small nation publishing
Xu X.,Internet of things in service innovation,2012,"Last decade has witnessed rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) literatures by scientists from technology domain such as computer science, telecommunication and engineering, but very few studies have been done by sociologists and even fewer by economic geographers in service research. The great impact that IoT will bring to service offerings and its spatial consequence is disproportionate to how much research has been done in this area. The paper aims to understand how the adoption of IoT affects the spatial ramification of service offerings and service business. After the theoretical framework and research method, part three explains what the implications of IoT in service context are, why and how IoT enables innovation in services and the current obstacles. Part four further discusses what could be the spatial ramification with the case of China emerging IoT industry in city Wuxi.",Digital economy; Economic geography; Internet of things; Service innovation
"Bieron B., Ahmed U.",Regulating E-commerce through international policy: Understanding the international trade law issues of E-commerce,2012,"The Internet has facilitated a new wave of economic growth and development. Businesses across the world - both big and small - have taken advantage of the scale, scope, and access that the Internet provides to reach new markets and consumers. A small business in rural America can now reach an individual consumer in the European Union (EU) without any physical footprint in the EU. This type of transaction was not possible before the advent of electronic commerce (e-commerce). Moreover, this type of transaction requires a revaluation of a trade regime that was created with only the largest multinational corporations able to truly engage in international trade. The US has created trade policy governing cross-border e-commerce transactions largely through recent free trade agreements (FTAs). Since 2000, every FTA the US has signed has contained a chapter on e-commerce. These chapters have included important protections for the digital economy (e.g., no tax on digital goods, transparency in regulation, and free flow of information).Yet, these chapters have often taken a very narrow view of the issues that they have sought to tackle. It is worthwhile, a decade after these provisions were first written, to revisit and update them to better reflect the nature of modern e-commerce. There are a number of additional issues that are imperative to e-commerce that have not been addressed in past trade regulation. E-commerce often results in the cross-border transfer of digital services. These digital services must be protected against trade-distortive and domestic discriminatory preferences. Moreover, nation-states often rely on narrow interpretations of intellectual property law to restrict the cross-border transfer of e-commerce products and services. These non-traditional barriers to trade must be broken down. Internet intermediaries provide essential services that drive e-commerce. Strong limitations on liability must be guaranteed for these intermediaries. Finally, small businesses are only starting to engage in e-commerce. Future trade regulation should facilitate the growth of small businesses engaged in e-commerce. This article begins by describing the rapid growth of the e-commerce economy. It then reviews the history of past US free-trade agreement e-commerce provisions and suggests how to improve and update these provisions. The document then describes a host of additional e-commerce related issues that should be addressed in trade policy moving forward. © 2012 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands.",
Merritt H.,Factors affecting the adoption of an emerging technology: The diffusion of Wi-Fi Internet in Mexico,2012,"According to the literature in the field of Information Technology (IT), those who are unable to get access to the Internet tend to lack the necessary skills for harnessing the so-called ""knowledge base economy"". This situation is known as ""digital divide"". This problem has posed a major challenge for developing nations, such as Mexico, because of the rapid changes in the technology supporting the Internet, especially in wireless connections, which are rending obsolete the existing landline infrastructure. In this paper, we investigate the recent trends in the diffusion of Wi-Fi Internet in Mexico from a technology policy point of view. Available data suggest that a bottleneck in the Mexican legislation has discouraged private agents of supplying wireless Internet services, which in turn has affected the competitiveness of the Mexican telecommunications sector and, through this, of the Mexican economy at large. © 2012 IEEE.",

A systems approach was developed for a VELO and is presented in this paper. The VELO has to perform these three basic entrepreneurial tasks in interaction with a dynamic and complex global business environment. This requires exploring the future, predicting technology developments and preparing for the unknown. Developing visions of the future and linking the foresight to entrepreneurial decision-making is a big challenge in today's global economy. Global sustainable development is a widely accepted vision in today's world. Despite of the practical problems, this vision gives future direction for emerging technologies and changes in social, economic and ecological dimensions. The view on the global challenge of a sustainable development shows enterprises' opportunities to achieve and sustain vitality at the company-level: The VELO can contribute to a global sustainable development via innovation in new and established businesses to maintain their own competitiveness, reputation and economic substance. The paper describes global and company-level perspectives on sustainability and business opportunities as well as the interaction between the VELO and the global business environment.

"Mulder P., de Groot H.L.F.","Structural change and convergence of energy intensity across OECD countries, 1970-2005",2012,"This paper uses new and unique data derived from a consistent framework of national accounts to compute and evaluate energy intensity developments across 18 OECD countries and 50 sectors over the period 1970-2005. We find that across countries energy intensity levels tend to decrease in most Manufacturing sectors. In the Service sector, energy intensity decreases at a relatively slow rate, with diverse trends across sub-sectors. A decomposition analysis reveals that changes in the sectoral composition of the economy explain a considerable and increasing part of aggregate energy intensity dynamics. A convergence analysis reveals that only after 1995 cross-country variation in aggregate energy intensity levels clearly tends to decrease, driven by a strong and robust trend break in Manufacturing and enhanced convergence in Services. Moreover, we find evidence for the hypothesis that across sectors lagging countries are catching-up with leading countries, with rates of convergence that are on average higher in Services than in Manufacturing. Aggregate convergence patterns are almost exclusively caused by convergence of within-sector energy intensity levels, and not by convergence of the sectoral composition of economies. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Convergence; Decomposition; Energy intensity; Sectoral analysis
"Balocco R., Ghezzi A., Rangone A., Toletti G.",A strategic analysis of the European companies in the ICT sales channel,2012,"The strategic role of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) is growing in various companies. Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) adopt ICT solutions to support their processes and to improve their products and services. Because of SMEs' scarce resources and inadequate ICT competencies, they need support from ICT suppliers in the ICT adoption process. Little attention has been paid to the business models and strategies of ICT suppliers in the academic and professional literature, and SMEs find it difficult to determine the characteristics of available ICT suppliers and to choose the supplier that best responds to their needs and aims. The goal of this paper is to provide a detailed picture of the ICT sales channel and its players in the European market. A classification framework is proposed and eleven different business models are identified. The paper is based on a case study methodology that included 53 semi-standardized interviews with CEOs (Chief Executive Officers) and marketing and communications managers at leading European ICT suppliers coupled with the literature review. © 2012 Balocco et al.",Digital economy; Distribution channel; ICT

"Doong S.H., Ho S.-C.",The impact of ICT development on the global digital divide,2012,"Information and communication technology (ICT) has accelerated the growth of the global economy and improved the quality life of the world's inhabitants. ICT has brought new ways of creating livelihoods for people. The diffusion of ICT has also increased year by year and made it possible to reduce poverty. The opportunities created by ICT also may eventually decrease the ""distance"" between countries in many other ways. Because access to ICT plays a key role in defining the global digital divide, it is important to study how the ICT gaps among countries have changed. This study examines global ICT development in the last decade. We collected secondary data for 136 countries from 2000 to 2008. Four relevant variables are used as proxies for the ICT development status of a country. Because of this multivariate nature of the data, most previous studies have applied a composite index approach to represent the ICT status of a country. For this study, we developed a framework to reduce multivariate raw data into an ordinal number representing a country's ICT development level. The methodology behind the framework involves data clustering and multi-dimensional data ranking. After applying this data reduction procedure, we explored ICT development paths of different countries, and also conducted panel data analysis based on gross national income and various fixed effects. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

"Safaian M., Gholami M., Rahmani Z.",Trust and risk in e-business and e-commerce applications and trends in the retailing sector in Iran,2012,"This paper discusses e-commerce adoption trends in the Iranian retail sector. Data were collected using questionnaire and interviews of 170 retailers and 73 customers selected in Tehran. Iran's retail sector lags behind in e-business adoption. Key e-commerce applications were in administration, accounting, management and control systems with barcode-driven systems and debit card swipe technologies being most common. Mismatch between the demand for e-business solutions by customers and the supply of such solutions by retailers and a pronounced digital divide between multiple store and single store retailers in the areas of network technologies were identified. The impact of e-business on business processes and company productivity is positive for multiple store and minimal for single store operators. Internal work organisation, procurement costs of supply goods and quality of product and services impacts are minimal. Scope exists for improved adoption and development of e-business for Iranian retailers through better policies and supportive legislation. © 2012 IEEE.",applications in Iran; E-business; E-commerce; Internet business in developing economies; retail sector; risk; Trust
Şandor S.D.,ICT and public administration reforms,2012,"The advent of new ICTs brought a lot of new assumptions about radical changes in our society. In the context of the arrival of a new society, public administration was supposed to witness (and to address or implement) changes at different levels, such as: • citizenship (citizens becoming participants in governance or even a shift to e-democracy); • the nature of public service jobs (in terms of skills, work processes and job design); • organizational changes (from a hierarchical to a more horizontal structure, to network or even virtual organizations); and • the entire government (from classic bureaucracy to New Public Management and to network and digital governance). Technological change cannot be judged outside the social, economic and political frameworks. The massive change in our society cannot be explained only by technological (especially ICT) factors. Excluding other factors may help us predict easier (but not more accurately) future evolutions but as a scientific effort it is a bad practice. Much of the assumptions about technological change came from hasty generalizations. The changing nature of some collective actions, jobs in certain areas of the economy or organizations were considered as optimal (and necessary) paths for the entire society (from individual to national levels). Public administration reforms are far from being a consequence of new technologies. Moreover public administration reforms do not embed ICTs and do not have a happy marriage with e-government.",e-democracy; Information and communication technology; New Public Management; Organizational change; Public administration reform
Wing M.,"The digital copyright time bomb in the BRIC economies, some ideas from the UK for the Indian market",2012,"The purpose of this work is to provide an overview of the current debate over copyright piracy and its control in Western countries, especially the use of graduated response laws in countries like the UK, and provide some thoughts and lessons on better responses that may be adopted in countries like India where evidence suggests the market in broadband access is rapidly developing, with associated piracy implications. The work provides an overview of the current legal issues surrounding copyright piracy, and the most recent response of graduated response laws, together with the flaws in such responses. The author suggests through a coordinated strategy comprising four elements which will increase the success of on-line businesses involving copyright works (particularly film and music) in attracting people who may traditionally turn to piracy. Substantial losses as high as 40 per cent of revenues are reported by some copyright industries due to on-line piracy. The legal responses so far have proved to be largely ineffective due to problems the author identifies. Further, the latest legal responses such as graduated response will also fail for reasons the author elaborates. It is argued that it is time to take a different more pragmatic and coordinated approach to on-line piracy. If the suggested copyright exploitation strategy is adopted and successful, legitimate copyright businesses may start to take market share from piracy and considerably increase their revenues. The authors model with four interdependent pillars or legs postulates that a successful on-line copyright business must have a fully coordinated, realistic and pragmatic approach to maximising revenues and minimising losses, as it is clear that legal regulation per se appears to be inadequate to this task. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",BRIC; Broadband adoption; Copyright; India; Internet; Management; Piracy; Strategy; United Kingdom
"Borisov D., Ciocoiu C.N.",Digital development and quality of life in Romania: A numerical characterization,2012,"Starting from the idea that any economic growth must also generate better living conditions, a range of methods and indicators for evaluate standard of living and quality of life were developed. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the most recognized indicator but criticism of GDP made researchers to focus on finding more complex indicators which could accurately reflect changes in the standard of living (and especially in the quality of life) generated by expansion of a new kind of economy called digital economy. In this study is conducted an exploratory research using historical data for seven representative indicators to characterize the digital development and quality of life of a country. The characterization uses indicators of values dispersion within a numerical range, using quantiles computing in the form of deciles. What we aim to emphasize is Romania's current positioning in a top decile of the performance profile (and the advance or decline of this position when compared with 2000); also interesting is highlighting the convergence performances in what regards the analyzed indicators and the distribution of values of some countries of interest (obviously, Romania is of primary interest) in data sets of an indicator of the digital development.",Deciles; Digital economy; Quality of life; Romania; Standard of living

However, many municipalities in the United States have been left behind in terms of Internet penetration. Some municipal governments have tried to address this by launching initiatives that aim at offering citywide, universal broadband access. Unfortunately, most of these initiatives either have been discontinued or have ended in failure. Drawing on actor-network theory, we conducted a 3-year study to investigate the evolution of the Internet TV initiative in LaGrange, Georgia, in the United States. The results reveal distinct interpretations of the initiative by different actor groups (the government, the service providers, socioeconomically advantaged residents, and socioeconomically disadvantaged residents), at different stages of implementation, pointing to tensions among the various groups. These tensions reflect the structural problems embedded in the macro political, economic, and societal context.

James R.,Out of the box - Freescale: How free models scale in the world of information,2012,"In the physical sciences, as complex systems approach a phase transition (a change in a feature of a physical system that results in a discrete transition of that system to another state), there is an abundance of micro-events and new signals. There is evidence of a similar turbulence in the fusion of digital technology and publishing. As observers and participants, the hardest part of this is not in chronicling the changes but in recognizing the emerging patterns in order to make predictions for the future. As technology develops, it presents new options for content in a digital world and potential opportunities grow exponentially. However, the sustaining growth factors do not lie in technology, but lie with the economics of the markets and the ecology of adoption. Using the recent history of the Encyclopaedia Britannica as a template I present the three Internets - of People, of Things and the Social Internet. These three Internets enable different market phenomena: growing demand, improving efficiency, transforming production. Recognizing this difference is to see the future of the library amidst the declining economics of the printed world.

Design/methodology/approach: Based on a focus group interview, the study identified and classified the DGB models into four types in terms of sales channels and service methods, and further proposed five evolution strategies for the DGM. Findings: The paper proposes five evolution strategies for the DGB: from streaming direct to streaming intermediary; from download direct to download intermediary; from download intermediary to streaming intermediary; from download direct to streaming direct; and from download direct to streaming intermediary. These evaluation strategies will be suitably applicable to the type of digital goods for which a business strives. Research limitations/implications: As the study is exploratory in nature, further research will be required to empirically confirm the findings of the underlying study regarding various DGBs, such as software, games, and movies. In addition, as the proposed typology reflects only the current state of the DGB industry, a further elaboration of the typology may also prove necessary in the future as technologies and the DGB industry evolve. Originality/value: Providing a useful theoretical foundation for future DGB studies and valuable insight into practical applications in the ever-growing DGB field, the paper delivers transitional strategic insights based on digital goods taxonomy.

Fuller S.,The emerging political economy of Humanity 2.0,2012,"""Humanity 2.0"" refers to the title of my recent book (Humanity 2.0: What It Means to Be Human Past, Present and Future, Palgrave Macmillan, 2011), in which I present humanity as historically poised to re-negotiate its sense of collective identity. There are at least five reasons for this, which are addressed in this paper: (a) the prominence of digital technology in shaping everyday life and human self-understanding; (b) the advances (both promised and realized) in biotechnology that aim to extend the human condition, perhaps even into a phase that might be called ""trans-"" or ""post-"" human; (c) a growing sense of ecological consciousness (much of it promoted by a sense of impending global catastrophe); (d) a growing awareness of the biological similarity between humans and other animals, reviving doubts about strictly naturalistic criteria for demarcating the ""human""; and (e) an increasing sense of human affection and sympathy migrating to animals and even androids, during a period when national health budgets are stretched perhaps to an unprecedented extent. The article is structured into two parts. The first part follows the humanistic implications of the claim that the computer was the innovation that most changed the human condition in the twentieth century. The overriding significance of the computer provides a gateway to our emerging sense of ""Humanity 2.0"". The second part focuses on the implications of Humanity 2.0 for welfare policy, concluding with a thought experiment concerning health policy. Here the basic point is that the ontological framework for conceptualizing the just liberal society is subtly shifting from the potential to the virtual as the normative benchmark of our humanity. © 2012 Copyright ICCR Foundation.",
Samonis V.,Macro Prudential Regulation and Governance in Long Cycles: Towards Modern Experiential Learning Approach,2012,"We have not yet learned how to adapt to modern innovation challenges in the global economy's long cycles and how to govern the associated risks. All the traditional economic theories are too simplistic and do not account for the change in the speeds of global adjustments (esp. financial flows) in the modern digital and knowledge economy. This special analysis reveals that, inadequacies at micro- and macro-levels in the political-economic systems in the global economy cause a new type of crises which cannot be easily contained, let alone prevented, on the strengths of the classical self-correction mechanisms. This new problem is brought about by the speed of capital and information flows in the global (digital) economy. It follows therefore that, on top of new understanding of the real behavior of economic agents (and their dynamic interactions in complex systems), what we need are new institutions that help speed the necessary “processing and digestion” of knowledge to prevent “rubbish in, rubbish out” modeling syndrome, so that policy responses are much better informed and adequate than before. What to make of the new quantities of data and information is a new challenge (knowledge management challenge) that does not lend itself to atomized solutions. On the contrary, new governance supporting institutions are needed. Such knowledge management institutions (e.g. college of macroprudential regulators) would make a very good use of the new understanding of the economic principles (e.g. new agent based paradigms) and, in the longer run (long cycles), would provide less expensive solutions than market excess corrections via new global Great Depression. © 2012, © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",governance; great recession; knowledge management; long cycles; Macro prudential regulation

This paper investigates how locating in different types of clusters and parks interacted by firm size or in-house R&D capability affects a firm's innovation. Empirically testing the research hypotheses by the data of 165 Taiwan's manufacturing firms in the information and communication technology sector and taking policy-driven parks (e. g., science parks and industrial parks) and spontaneously clusters as examples, we find that in emerging economies, firms with inferior in-house R&D capability gain more innovation benefits by locating in a science park or a spontaneous cluster while smaller firms gain more innovation benefits by locating in an industry park or a spontaneous cluster. Moreover, our findings also suggest that locating in a science park, smaller firms benefit more than larger firms in terms of innovation performance whereas larger firms benefit more than smaller firms in terms of market performance. The findings suggest that in emerging economies, compared to larger firms, smaller firms are less influenced by negative spillover effect when locating in clusters or parks. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Agglomeration effect; In-house R&D; Science-based parks; SMEs

Using a sample of 83 listed companies in Bangladesh in the year 2009 and the disclosure index of Deller et al., Marston, Xiao et al. and Marston and Polei and comments from the users and investors of Bangladesh, the study employs statistical analysis to investigate the association between a number of company characteristics and the extent of voluntary disclosure of IFR. The findings revealed that only 29.12 percent (83) companies had web sites out of the 285 listed companies and only 33.34 percent (28) companies' provided financial information. Out of seven variables, only big audit firms and non-family ownership variables were significantly associated with the levels of voluntary disclosure. Another important result revealed that despite the mandatory requirements of having audit committee in Bangladesh, the companies without the audit committee were disclosing voluntary information more and it raised the question on the lack of regulatory enforcement in Bangladesh. The scope of this study is limited to a single country; it would be interesting to replicate this study to a group of emerging countries which have many similarities to the Bangladesh environment. To the best of the authors' knowledge, no studies have been conducted on IFR in a South Asian emerging country, in particular Bangladesh. The study also is the first of its kind to examine the whole population of a period in any country which enhances contribution to IFR literature. Unlike the prior studies conducted in emerging countries, the study contributes not only to the present state of IFR by the listed companies in Bangladesh but also the connectivity problem between the dream and reality of the digital Bangladesh concept. The study also finds that the companies' IFR practices are not influenced by “Digital Bangladesh” concept. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Bangladesh; Emerging economies; Emerging markets; Information disclosure; Internet financial reporting; Voluntary disclosure
Maliniak D.,Cost of wireless test must fall to protect margins,2012,"One of the biggest trends in the wireless test arena is the increasing urgency to reduce the cost of test, a trend that is made imperative by the state of the economy and the ferociously competitive nature of the consumer electronics market. Wireless devices or systems that operate on licensed spectrum must be calibrated for the power limits of the band they operate on. Another trend that is affecting test is the move from RF down to the baseband domain. Additionally, analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion blocks are being moved from the digital domain and into RF, closer to the power amplifier. Even though much of the design work on mobile devices will be performed at baseband going forward, design teams must continue to work carefully in the RF sections.

Hunton P.,Data attack of the cybercriminal: Investigating the digital currency of cybercrime,2012,"It is increasingly argued that the primary motive of the cybercriminal and the major reason for the continued growth in cyber attacks is financial gain. In addition to the direct financial impact of cybercrime, it can also be argued that the digital data and the information it represents that can be communicated through the Internet, can have additional intrinsic value to the cybercriminal. In response to the perceived value and subsequent demand for illicit data, a sophisticated and self-sufficient underground digital economy has emerged. The aim of this paper is to extend the author's earlier research that first introduced the concept of the Cybercrime Execution Stack by examining in detail the underlying data objectives of the cybercriminal. Both technical and non-technical law enforcement investigators need the ability to contextualise and structure the illicit activities of the cybercriminal, in order to communicate this understanding amongst the wider law enforcement community. By identifying the potential value of electronic data to the cybercriminal, and discussing this data in the context of data collection, data supply and distribution, and data use, demonstrates the relevance and advantages of utilising an objective data perspective when investigating cybercrime. © 2012 Grace Li.

Moreover, the instability in demand increases the need for enterprises to procure new partners as well as the associated risk of dealing with partners that may be unknown beforehand. Therefore, enterprises need mechanisms that allow to evaluate the confidence they have on their current and potential new, unknown, partners, and to monitor this confidence in a continuous and automatic way. This paper presents our computational trust model, which was inspired in the concept of the hysteresis of trust and betrayal and in the asymmetry principle of human psychology. Our model allows to estimate the trustworthiness of agents using different features of the dynamics of trust. Additionally, we present a study on the effect of preselecting partners based on their trustworthiness in automated negotiation processes. The study was conducted experimentally using our agent-based Electronic Institution framework for e-Contracting, which includes a normative environment and an automatic negotiation service, as well as the mentioned computational trust service. The results obtained show that, in identified conditions, business clients benefit from preselecting partners based on trust prior to the negotiation phase. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Computational trust systems; dynamics of trust; multi-agent systems

The relevance of the topic is confirmed by the empirical evidence supported by various competitiveness reports which point out that the most leaders in the rankings on productivity or general economic performance prove a business sophisticated business operation, based on innovative mechanisms. The Romanian economy still lags behind the various EU averages in indicators concerning new technological advancements, the investments in research and development or in the education system that can foster the technological absorptive capacity. The described methodology uses data taken from the EUROSTAT and Human Development Report (HDR) indicators for building composite indicators based on multi-attribute decision model. The multiple-facets metrics have several: it addresses the multi-criteria used for revealing the numerous dimensions and the complexity of the phenomenon, reducing the noise in data across the sample and is informative for decision makers at domestic level in regard with the gap among various countries.

"Deegan M., Sutherland K.",Transferred illusions: Digital technology and the forms of print,2012,"This is a study of the forms and institutions of print - newspapers, books, scholarly editions, publishing, libraries - as they relate to and are changed by emergent digital forms and institutions. In the early 1990s hypertext was briefly hailed as a liberating writing tool for non-linear creation. Fast forward no more than a decade, and we are reading old books from screens. It is, however, the newspaper, for around two hundred years print's most powerful mass vehicle, whose economy persuasively shapes its electronic remediation through huge digitization initiatives, dominated by a handful of centralizing service providers, funded and wrapped round by online advertising. The error is to assume a culture of total replacement. The Internet is just another information space, sharing characteristics that have always defined such spaces - wonderfully effective and unstable, loaded with valuable resources and misinformation; that is, both good and bad. This is why it is important that writers, critics, publishers and librarians - in modern parlance, the knowledge providers - be critically engaged in shaping and regulating cyberspace, and not merely the passive instruments or unreflecting users of the digital tools in our hands. © Marilyn Deegan and Kathryn Sutherland 2009.

"Sung R.C.W., Ritchie J.M., Lim T., Liu Y., Kosmadoudi Z.",The automated generation of engineering knowledge using a digital engineering tool: An industrial evaluation case study,2012,"In a knowledge-based economy, it will be crucial to capture expertise and rationale in working environments of all kinds as the need develops to understand how people are working, the intuitive processes they use as they carry out tasks and make decisions and trying to determine the most effective methods and rationales for solving problems. Key outputs from this will be the capability to automate decision making activities and supporting training and learning in competitive business environments. Knowledge capture in knowledge-based economies will also be important in a wide range of sectors from the financial and business domains through to engineering and construction. In traditional expert environments, current manual knowledge capture techniques tend to be time-consuming, turgid and, if applied during an activity, interrupt the expert whilst they are carrying out the task. The alternative is to do this after the event, which loses important information about the process due to the individual usually forgetting a great deal of the decisions and alternatives they have used during a task session. With the advent and widespread use of computerized technology within business, this paper contends that new opportunities exist with regard to user logging and subsequent data analysis which mean that there is considerable potential for automating or semi-automating this kind of knowledge capture. As a case study demonstrating the possibility of attaining automated knowledge capture, this work investigates product design. Within long lifecycle products of all kinds there is a need to capture the engineering rationale, process, information and knowledge created during a design session. Once these data has been captured, in an automated and unobtrusive manner, it must be represented in a fashion which allows it to be easily accessible, understandable, stored and reused at a later date. This can subsequently be used to inform experienced engineers of decisions taken much earlier in the design process or used to train and support inexperienced engineers while they are moving up the learning curve. Having these data available is especially important in long lifecycle projects since many design decisions are made early on in the process and are then required to be understood by engineers a number of years down the line. There is also the likelihood that if an engineer were to leave during the project, any undocumented design knowledge relating to their contribution to the design process will leave with them. This paper describes research on non-intrusively capturing and formalizing product lifecycle knowledge by demonstrating the automated capture of engineering processes through user logging using an immersive virtual reality (VR) system for cable harness design and assembly planning. Furthermore, several industrial collaborators of the project have been visited to determine what their knowledge capture practices are; these findings are also detailed. Computerized technology and business management systems in the knowledge-based economies of the future will require the capture of expertise as quickly and effectively as possible with minimum overhead to the company along with the formal storage and access to such key data. The application of the techniques and knowledge representations presented in this paper demonstrate the potential for doing this in both engineering and non-engineering domains. © 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company.",Knowledge capture; knowledge representation; virtual reality

The need to address the numerical measurement of such relations is driven from the evidence that there is a profound inference of the digital universe on business and professional life, impacting on the ability of organizations to manage effectively the IT risks associated to their regular activity. In order for eenterprises to choose the proper approach aimed to raise the awareness of ICT security policy, the relevant risks should be evaluated and their level benchmarked to a reference - most of the time, the best practices elsewhere or even the average level of a commonly agreed measure play this role. The paper uses a technique used as a benchmark method for assessing performance in order to point out the distance of a certain subject (in this case, Romanian economy) to the current state of other UE state members regarding several IT and ICT security indicators.

Smedinghoff T.J.,Solving the legal challenges of trustworthy online identity,2012,"Digital identity management is fundamental to the further development of the Internet economy. It is a foundational requirement for most substantive e-commerce transactions and other online activities. The critical importance of online identity management has led numerous governments, inter-governmental groups, and private organizations to begin work on development of viable and scalable business, technical, and legal frameworks to address the challenge of online identity. The focus of this work is on the emerging ""federated"" approach to identity, where an enterprise engages in online transactions in reliance on identity credentials issued by any one of several third parties, and individuals can use the same identity credential to engage in transactions with multiple organizations. This article examines this key requirement for online transactions, and explores the legal challenges that businesses must address to reap the benefits of federated identity. It begins with a general overview of digital identity management e what it is, why it is important, and generally how it works. Then, focusing on the federated identity approach, it examines the need for operating rules to ensure that such an identity system functions properly and in a manner deemed trustworthy by the participants. To that end, it identifies the key legal challenges that must be addressed to make identity systems work, and highlights some of the key issues of structuring an appropriate identity system legal framework. © 2012 Patrick Ryan & Sarah Falvey.",Authentication; Credential; E-identity; Federated identity management; Identification; Identity management; Identity system; Liability; Online identity; Operating rules; Privacy; Trust framework; Trusted identity

Spais G.S.,The case of region marketing of a Greek Southwestern City: Building a new image and personality of open innovation and creativity,2012,"The examination of the municipal broadband and building a ""digital city"" for a southwestern Greek city is the heart of this case study in terms of city's repositioning through open innovation and creativity. The paradigm of the first successful Greek digital city (""e-Trikala"") shows to every Greek that the Digital City ICT applications can improve everyday life by simplifying public transactions in regional urban centers, reducing telecommunication costs, and by delivering new services related to the local way of life (Heeks, 2010). However, every SME has its own social, economic, geographic, or political characteristics (Foster & Heeks, 2010). For this reason, the digital city can vary from region to region, so that ICT applications enhance local characteristics rather than detract from them. The author's objective is to create an independent case study that can be used as the basis for class discussion. The case of repositioning of Kalamata, a Greek southwestern city, as an open innovative and creative city through the new municipal broadband infrastructure presents a situation that requires the readers of this case study to develop and evaluate solutions. The case may be also meaningfully discussed, presented, or analyzed with reference to other cases. It can be used by itself without creating false impressions. In this case study, Kalamata's municipal leadership believes that a short-term promotion campaign for the benefit of the city's digitalization is enough to build a new image and personality for the city: the image and personality of an open, innovative, and creative city, an ideal location to visit, do business, and live. The development of a short-term promotion campaign in order to achieve the repositioning of a city is a major strategic pitfall. The municipal leaders must realize that transforming the city as an open innovative and creative city, needs a new philosophy. The achievement of such a strategic goal prerequires an overall transformation of all the protagonists (from citizens to municipal administrators to entrepreneurs) as the following strategic issues must be managed: the introduction of an open innovation model, the choice of an innovation scenario for the local economy, and the strategy in order to address the way of urban innovation through the municipal broadband infrastructure. However, the question remains whether transformative learning and building critical reflection are the paths for building a new image and personality for Kalamata as an open innovative and creative city. © 2012, IGI Global.",

Design/methodology/approach: In the last decades, the development and advancement of information and communication technologies (ICTs) and the business innovations related to them have defined a new economy which is known as ""digital economy"". Establishing and running businesses in this digital space means carrying out a kind of electronic commerce by exploiting the internet and other electronic networks. The new digital economy provides exceptional opportunities for many entrepreneurs to create new ventures in different business areas according to electronic commerce models. Given that researchers in Iran have not studied digital entrepreneurship and there is a great interest in digital entrepreneurship, further research is needed on this subject. According to research in Canada by Carrier et al. on cyber entrepreneurship, the authors used the same method and studied five cases that work in digital entrepreneurship in Iran. In this paper, the authors first review the literature of digital entrepreneurship - digital entrepreneurship framework that include a typology of digital ventures and their characteristics, characteristics of digital entrepreneurs, and the distinctions between digital and traditional entrepreneurship. Then five digital entrepreneurs in Iran were surveyed to explore the process of their entrepreneurship and competitive elements applied by them. Findings: The most notable contribution of this research is the focus on the process of this type of entrepreneurship and the steps which were used by entrepreneurs. Unlike the traditional forms of entrepreneurship, the entrepreneurs in cyber space in Iran did not examine the feasibility of their projects; also, the identification of a business opportunity created business ideas. Another contribution is that the authors found ten factors as the internet-based entrepreneurs' competitive elements in Iran, and also found interesting results about characteristics of internet-based entrepreneurs.

We also found a stronger correlation between some eWOM channels and sales compared to other channels. eWOM has traditionally been considered an un-structured and ad-hoc source of sentiment. Our results suggest that eWOM generated in social networking when analysed appropriately is a fairly reliable predictor of market success. It is effective as a tacit suggestion, recommendation, or referral element with viral network effects.

Mismatch between the demand for e-business solutions by customers and the supply of such solutions by retailers and a pronounced digital divide between multiple store and single store retailers in the areas of network technologies were identified. The impact of e-business on business processes and company productivity is positive for multiple store and minimal for single store operators.

Odendaal N.,The spaces between: ICT and marginalization in the South African city,2011,"Popular media and policy rhetoric often portray Information and Communication Technology (ICT) as a means to social and economic empowerment. Many assumptions embedded in ICT for Development (ICT4D) literature do the same. The ubiquitous presence of mobile telephony in emerging countries such as South Africa and proliferation of digital networks imply a critical role for these technologies in overcoming physical constraints in space. Is access to technology enough however? This paper responds by reflecting on two sources of data collected over a three-year period in Durban, South Africa. A web development process for community organizations in two townships was followed and documented. The second data source entailed focus groups conducted with foreign street traders (hawkers) active in many parts of the city.

"Koeberl P., Li J., Rajan A., Vishik C.",Silicon PUFs in practice,2011,"Low cost computing devices have become a key enabler of the digital economy, supporting everyday activities such as banking, access control, and travel. These devices often present highly resource constrained environments which impede the introduction of technologies that can improve the safety of the transactions performed on them. Several approaches have been proposed which strive to enhance the security of the user application without significantly increasing the associated cost, for example foregoing the use of higher grade smart cards supporting efficient public-key cryptography. In high volume scenarios the cost saving associated with such a decision can be compelling and security is invariably compromised as a result. This paper proposes realistic scenarios for the use of silicon PUFs (Physically Unclonable Functions) to enable lower cost and more secure implementations of smartcards and similar technologies. Silicon PUFs leverage the unique manufacturing variation present on all ICs to support authentication that is conceptually similar to biometric functionality as well as the generation of cryptographic key material. We recognize that significant improvements in PUF implementation will need to be achieved in order to make the technology commercially deployable. With these improvements, we can anticipate the potential applicability of PUFs to meeting the authentication, confidentiality and integrity requirements of many everyday transactions. In addition, the volatility of PUF-based secrets offers an attractive alternative to storing cryptographic keys in non-volatile memory. © Vieweg+Teubner Verlag | Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden GmbH 2011.",
Mahmood Z.,Barriers to developing eGovernment projects in developing countries,2011,"eGovernment is about transforming the way a government interacts with its citizens and harnessing the information and technology revolution to improve the efficiency of the government. It is the use of information and communications technologies (ICTs) to operate more effectively and transparently to strengthen support to public policies and involve the citizens in decision making processes. eGovernment is not a one-off process or a single event: its implementation is a staged anditerative process that requires a clear vision and long term strategy. If implemented appropriately, eGovernment offers numerous benefits including: 1) cost reduction, efficiency gains and improved quality of service delivery; 2) transparency and accountability; 3) development of a networked digital community and a true information society; 4) better and efficient decision making on the part of government leaders and 5) citizens' participation through e-democracy. Whereas, developed economies of the world are well advanced in the process of achieving vertical and horizontal full integration within the eGovernment provision, many developing countries are only at the initial stages of such developments and are finding it difficult to progress to the next stages to achieve full eGovernment. Difficulties are due to the fact that eGovernment is a huge undertaking and there are numerous inherent issues and barriers to successful development and implementation which include: 1) lack of clear vision and commitment from political leadership; 2) inappropriate assessment of eReadiness of the nation; 3) lack of ICT infrastructure and provision; 4) unavailability of ICT equipment and citizens' limited access to such technology and 5) citizens' inability to make full use of ICT usually due to lack of e-literacy and the digital divide that normally exist in most developing countries. This paper discusses such limitations and barriers and presents a way forward by suggesting that governments need to ensure that: 1) they have a clear vision, strategy and commitment; 2) they understand the complexity of the undertaking and the level of investment required;3) they develop workable and transparent policies and structures and 4) they also consider human factors including people's preferences and ways of actions. The aim of this paper is to provide some useful practical guidance so that the eGovernment projects have a better chance of being more successful.",Barriers; Developing countriest; eGovernment; eReadiness; Issues

This paper aims to explore the development process of digital transformation through an e-banking project based on the resource fit concept. Design/methodology/approach: The qualitative method of case study is applied. In total, 17 in-depth interviews and secondary data were collected and analyzed. Findings: Numerous researches related to e-banking have focused on either the resource-based theory or strategic fit perspective, but not on both. This paper makes a unique contribution by constructing a resource fit framework that integrates these two theories. This framework offers a theoretical advancement in the resource fit literature. It includes four dimensions: external resource fit, internal resource fit, external capability fit, and internal capability fit. Through an actual empirical case examination of the resource fit framework, this study explored eight critical factors necessary for successful e-banking project implementation. Research limitations/implications: This study fills a theoretical gap by developing an integrative framework and evaluating it via an empirical case study. Hence, examining this framework for organizational digital transformation in different industries and multiple case studies with cross-cases comparison will be valuable for future research. Practical implications: The study demonstrated that managing digital transformation can be challenging, but awareness of, and preparedness for, analysis of both the resources/capability and external demands through the resource fit perspective are necessary.

Perceived enabling factors were: co-mentoring from business partners, course content, financial gain, creativity and innovative ideas, control and risk taking, and the overarching package of support. Linkages between internal and external support could be improved. Research limitations/implications: The study provided insights into constraints and enablers to self-employment for a small cohort of recent graduates looking to start-up in the creative and digital industries. Further studies are required to explore the suggested effect of the ""creative identity"", and of sector-specific family entrepreneurial background. Practical implications: The support provided by universities can facilitate the transition from early stage ideas to actual graduate business start-up. Issues such as provision of specialist advice and links with external parallel and follow-on support need to be considered. Originality/value: University start-up units provide an important contribution to the development of graduate entrepreneurs and their role in the growth of national and global economy. Suggestions for improvements in performance, such as closer links with external business development agencies and support providers, are discussed. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Business enterprise; Entrepreneurship education; Higher education; Regeneration; Student and graduate business start-up; United Kingdom
"Chu Y.-Y., Lin S.-W.",Network ontology and dynamics analysis for collaborative innovation in digital services,2011,"With the advances of digital technologies and participative webs of services, knowledge-intensive digital services have thrived on a rapidly expanding platform-based network economy. There is a great need for a comprehensive research on knowledge based analysis on social network and business network evolution to facilitate collaborative development of digital services. This research aims to develop an ontology-guided analysis of networking to facilitate the formation of the innovation network to create new digital services. Central to the research is a dynamic ontology construct that could articulate the evolution of the social and business networks driven by the prospects of value creation with networking structure and routines contributing to recognizing, engaging, and mobilizing key actors and resources. Based on a prototype model and a series of case studies of the emerging knowledge-intensive service industries, this research explores the potential of the model in adapting to the heterogeneity of the service demands and collaboration mechanisms in the service network. Through in-depth model-based analysis and synthesis of the emerging digital service activities, this research expects to develop an ontology-based platform for knowledge creation and network management system to capture the extensive opportunities for value creation in participative webs of services on experience economics. © 2011 IEEE.",
Head S.,The New Ruthless Economy: Work and Power in the Digital Age,2011,"In the great boom of the 1990s, compensation to the top level of management soared, but the wage levels of most Americans barely grew at all. This stagnation has baffled experts, but this book points to information technology (IT) as the prime cause of this growing wage disparity. Many economists, technologists and business consultants have predicted that IT would liberate the work force, bringing self-managed work teams and decentralized decision making. The book argues that the opposite has happened. Reengineering, a prime example of how business processes have been computerized, has instead simplified the work of middle and lower level employees, fenced them in with elaborate rules, and set up digital monitoring to make sure that the rules are obeyed. This is true even in such high-skill professions as medicine, where decision-making software in the hands of HMO's decides the length of a patient's stay in hospital and determines the treatments patients will or will not receive. In lower-skill jobs, such as in the call center industry, workers are subject to the indignity of scripting software that lays out the exact conversation, line by line, which agents must follow when speaking with customers. The book argues that these computer systems devalue a worker's experience and skill, and subject employees to a degree of supervision which is excessive and demeaning. The harsh and often unstable work regime of reengineering also undermines the security of employees and so weakens their bargaining power in the workplace. © 2003 by Simon Head.

Kierkegaard P.,Electronic health record: Wiring Europe's healthcare,2011,"The European Commission wants to boost the digital economy by enabling all Europeans to have access to online medical records anywhere in Europe by 2020. With the newly enacted Directive 2011/24/EU on patients' rights in cross-border healthcare due for implementation by 2013, it is inevitable that a centralised European health record system will become a reality even before 2020. However, the concept of a centralised supranational central server raises concern about storing electronic medical records in a central location. The privacy threat posed by a supranational network is a key concern.

Watson B.C.,"Barcode Empires: Politics, Digital technology, and Comparative retail Firm strategies",2011,"Like other service sectors, information technology has dramatically altered the growth and character of the retail trade sector in the affluent economies. Nevertheless, significant variation exists in the typical strategies of retail firms in different countries. This article explores this variation and proposes an explanation for why retailers achieved scale and solved their make, buy, and partner decisions along such different trajectories. It argues that national bases for scale retailing were shaped by a series of political negotiations starting in the 1960s and 1970s. This demonstrates once again that technology implementation is rarely determined by the technology itself, but more often by social and political rules. Future technology platforms, such as web-based or mobile commerce, should be expected to follow similar political logics.

Boyles T.,Small business and web 2.0: Hope or Hype?,2011,"Considering the number of small businesses in the US, the magnitude of their impact on the economy, and the prevalence of ""Web 2.0"" in discussions regarding businesses, the dearth of scholarly work on small businesses and evolving web technologies seems salient. Web 2.0 is generally defined and distinguished by the presence of increased interactivity in Web applications and an underlying open and collaborative platform. Web 2.0 advocates suggest that the platform eliminates size advantages for businesses and allows small businesses and even single individuals the ability to compete with large corporations. Therefore, in this paper the opportunities and risks in Web 2.0 for small businesses are considered within the context of small business resource poverty. The structure and elements of Web 2.0 are analyzed and reveal potential opportunities within digital industries; however capitalizing on these opportunities requires resources that small businesses are not likely to possess. Overall, it appears that Web 2.0 is primarily a basis of competition, making it a risk for those small businesses that do not utilize it. In addition, no systematic method for evaluating the return on investment (ROI) of utilizing Web 2.0 applications has been developed. This leaves small businesses on their own to weigh the risks of not participating against the lack of understanding regarding the return on investment (ROI) of Web 2.0. Given the ubiquity of Web access and the permeation of the Web across numerous product and service categories, understanding and participating in the Web will only grow in importance for small businesses. As such, small businesses would be well served by research on Web 2.0 and its impact on small business success. Based on the analysis fruitful and practically useful research avenues are identified.",

In order to emphasize our suggestions, the most representative figures derived from recent surveys conducted by the Sectoral e-Business W@tch are selected and analyzed. These figures are: (a) the use of customer relationship management applications in tourism and the importance of mobile services for different sectors of the economy including tourism, for the first driver, (b) the use of supply chain management systems, online purchasing and finally the use of broadband Internet as a complementary indicator, for the second driver, and (c) the use of ICT-enabled product and process innovations and dynamic packaging, for the third driver.

Ogilvy J.,Facing the fold: From the eclipse of Utopia to the restoration of hope,2011,"Purpose: The objective of this paper is to make a case for a scenaric stance that holds high road and low road futures in mind at once. Opening with regrets about the total eclipse of Utopian thinking, the paper aims to move on to embrace both aspirational futures and a forthright recognition of the many ways in which things could go wrong. Adopting a scenaric stance amounts to a new, fourth attitude toward historical time and the future. The ancients lived in an ahistorical, cyclical time. Second, modernity embraced a progressive and optimistic approach to the future. Third, post-modernity turns pessimistic about the future. Fourth, a new scenaric stance vindicates Utopian optimism by pairing it with a forthright recognition of pessimistic possibilities. Design/methodology/approach: This is a reflective, almost philosophical paper that articulates a new attitude toward the future, which demonstrates the significance of scenario planning for attitudes toward the future. Findings: A scenaric stance can restore the liberatory potential of Utopian thinking by yoking optimistic, aspirational futures together with a clear-eyed recognition of the several ways that plans can misfire. Research limitations/implications: This is a philosophical, reflective piece that does not rely on any quantitative evidence or rigorous modeling. Practical implications: The practical implications are major: to the extent that the health of the economy relies on confidence and a willingness to take risks, a lemming-like race to the bottom will result in a Japan-like endless recession. A vindication is needed for aspirational scenarios. Social implications: Everyone is better off when fewer people are living in crouch. Originality/value: After three decades of reviewing and contributing to the literature on future studies, the author has seen nothing that remotely resembles the argument of this paper. Its value consists in its potential for lifting people's sights. One stands in danger of a loss of confidence and an endless recession. One needs to restore a sense of possibility and optimism, but can do so responsibly only if one holds on to an honest sense of the real dangers one faces. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Adaptability; Business planning; Digital Utopianism; Economic forecasting; Forecasting; Scenario planning
[No author name available],Protecting consumer privacy in an era of rapid change,2011,"In today's digital economy, consumer information is more important than ever. Companies are using this information in innovative ways to provide consumers with new and better products and services. Although many of these companies manage consumer information responsibly, some appear to treat it in an irresponsible or even reckless manner. And while recent announcements of privacy innovations by a range of companies are encouraging, many companies - both online and offline - do not adequately address consumer privacy interests. Industry must do better. For every business, privacy should be a basic consideration - similar to keeping track of costs and revenues, or strategic planning. To further this goal, this report proposes a normative framework for how companies should protect consumers' privacy. This proposal is intended to inform policymakers, including Congress, as they develop solutions, policies, and potential laws governing privacy, and guide and motivate industry as it develops more robust and effective best practices and self-regulatory guidelines. The framework is designed to serve as a policy vehicle for approaching privacy, but it includes elements that reflect longstanding Federal Trade Commission (""FTC"" or ""Commission"") law. Although privacy often has been said to mean ""the right to be let alone,""1 the application of this concept in modern times is by no means straightforward. Consumers live in a world where information about their purchasing behavior, online browsing habits, and other online and offline activity is collected, analyzed, combined, used, and shared, often instantaneously and invisibly. For example: • if you browse for products and services online, advertisers might collect and share information about your activities, including your searches, the websites you visit, and the content you view; • if you participate in a social networking site, third-party applications are likely to have access to the information you or your friends post on the site; • if you use location-enabled smartphone applications, multiple entities might have access to your precise whereabouts; • if you use loyalty cards at a grocery store or send in a product warranty card, your name, address, and information about your purchase may be shared with data brokers and combined with other data. Some consumers are troubled by the collection and sharing of their information. Others have no idea that any of this information collection and sharing is taking place. Still others may be aware of this collection and use of their personal information but view it as a worthwhile trade-off for innovative products and services, convenience, and personalization. And some consumers - some teens for example - may be aware of the sharing that takes place, but may not appreciate the risks it poses. In addition, consumers' level of comfort might depend on the context and amount of sharing that is occurring. For example, some consumers may be unconcerned about the collection and sharing of discrete pieces of information about them because that information, by itself, may seem innocuous. However, they may find the compilation of vast quantities of data about them surprising and disturbing. Because of these differences in consumer understanding, attitudes and behavior, as well as the rapid pace of change in technology, policymaking on privacy issues presents significant challenges. The FTC's efforts to protect consumer privacy date back to the 1970s, when it began enforcing one of the first federal privacy laws - the Fair Credit Reporting Act (""FCRA"").2 Since then, the Commission has sought to protect consumer privacy through law enforcement, policy initiatives, and consumer and business education. Using these tools, the Commission's goal in the privacy arena has remained constant: to protect consumers' personal information and ensure that they have the confidence to take advantage of the many benefits of the ever-changing marketplace. In recent years, the FTC has sought to advance this objective using two primary models: the ""notice-and-choice model,"" which encourages companies to develop privacy notices describing their information collection and use practices to consumers, so that consumers can make informed choices, and the ""harm-based model,"" which focuses on protecting consumers from specific harms - physical security, economic injury, and unwanted intrusions into their daily lives. Each model has significantly advanced the goal of protecting consumer privacy; at the same time, each has been subject to certain criticisms. Specifically, the notice-and-choice model, as implemented, has led to long, incomprehensible privacy policies that consumers typically do not read, let alone understand. Likewise, the harm-based model has been criticized for failing to recognize a wider range of privacy-related concerns, including reputational harm or the fear of being monitored. In addition, both models have struggled to keep pace with the rapid growth of technologies and business models that enable companies to collect and use consumers' information in ways that often are invisible to consumers. Meanwhile, industry efforts to address privacy through self- regulation have been too slow, and up to now have failed to provide adequate and meaningful protection. In light of these concerns, last year the Commission announced that it would host a series of roundtables to explore the privacy issues and challenges associated with 21st century technology and business practices - to determine how best to protect consumer privacy while supporting beneficial uses of information and technological innovation. Roundtable participants reflected a wide range of perspectives and included academics, technologists, privacy experts, consumer advocates, representatives from industry, and regulators. Several major themes emerged from these discussions, including: • the ubiquitous collection and use of consumer data; • consumers' lack of understanding and ability to make informed choices about the collection and use of their data; • the importance of privacy to many consumers; • the significant benefits enabled by the increasing flow of information; and • the blurring of the distinction between personally identifiable information and supposedly anonymous or de-identified information. Stakeholders emphasized the need to improve transparency, simplify the ability of consumers to exercise choices about how their information is collected and used, and ensure that businesses take privacy-protective measures as they develop and implement systems. At the same time, commenters and participants urged regulators to be cautious about restricting the exchange and use of consumer data in order to preserve the substantial consumer benefits made possible through the flow of information. Participants noted, for example, that the acquisition, exchange, and use of consumer data not only helps to fund a variety of personalized content and services, but also allows businesses to innovate and develop new products and services that offer consumers convenience and cost savings. Based upon the major themes and concepts developed through the roundtables, Commission staff is proposing a new framework for addressing the commercial use of consumer data. This framework builds upon the notice-and-choice and harm-based models, the FTC's law enforcement experience, and the record from the roundtables. Commission staff encourages all interested parties to submit written comments to help guide further development and refinement of the proposal. The proposed framework would apply broadly to online and offline commercial entities that collect, maintain, share, or otherwise use consumer data that can be reasonably linked to a specific consumer, computer or device. It contains three main components. First, companies should adopt a ""privacy by design""3 approach by building privacy protections into their everyday business practices. Such protections include providing reasonable security for consumer data, collecting only the data needed for a specific business purpose, retaining data only as long as necessary to fulfill that purpose, safely disposing of data no longer being used, and implementing reasonable procedures to promote data accuracy. Companies also should implement and enforce procedurally sound privacy practices throughout their organizations, including, for instance, assigning personnel to oversee privacy issues, training employees on privacy issues, and conducting privacy reviews when developing new products and services. Such concepts are not new, but the time has come for industry to implement them systematically. Implementation can be scaled to each company's business operations. Companies that collect and use small amounts of non-sensitive consumer data should not have to devote the same level of resources to implementing privacy programs as companies that collect vast amounts of consumer data, collect data of a sensitive nature, or engage in the business of selling consumer data. Second, Commission staff proposes that companies provide choices to consumers about their data practices in a simpler, more streamlined way than has been used in the past. Under this approach, consumer choice would not be necessary for a limited set of ""commonly accepted"" data practices, thus allowing clearer, more meaningful choice with respect to practices of greater concern. This component of the proposed framework reflects the concept that it is reasonable for companies to engage in certain commonly accepted practices - namely, product and service fulfillment, internal operations such as improving services offered, fraud prevention, legal compliance, and first-party marketing. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Vinekar A.,IT-enabled innovation to prevent infant blindness in rural India: The KIDROP experience,2011,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to share the IT-based experience of the first tele-ophthalmology initiative in infant blindness prevention set up to serve rural India. Design/methodology/approach – The paper describes the two-plus years of experience of the “Karnataka Internet Assisted Diagnosis of Retinopathy of Prematurity (KIDROP) initiative” pioneered by one of the leading private tertiary eye care providers in India, Narayana Nethralaya Postgraduate Institute of Ophthalmology, Bangalore. KIDROP was the first tele-ophthalmology initiative in the world to use trained non-physicians (“trained technicians”) to capture images of the retinas of infants a few weeks old for a potentially blinding condition called retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and validated them to store, process and analyze those images at the rural centre itself. In addition, these images were uploaded to a specially customized software-hardware platform that allowed remotely situated experts to view these images and report real time either on a PC or on their smart phones. The success of this private initiative paved the way for the first public-private partnership in infant blindness prevention in India which is poised for a statewide and subsequent nationwide expansion. Findings – In a country like India, where experts are few and far between and found mostly in the big cities, the human ability of “image processing” allows non-physicians to quickly gain the expertise to screen seemingly difficult cases by using the medium of digital images and a logical algorithm of triage. With an increasing caseload of these conditions, the standard of care can be delivered to the most underserved of areas with this little IT-based innovation served with dollops of passion. Practical implications – The experience of KIDROP is being used as a cornerstone for similar tele-ophthalmology programs in India and other developing countries with similar demographics. A case for propagating the innovation as an example of “reverse innovation” for more developed economies to emulate has also been made. Originality/value – The project described in the paper was the first that used non-physicians to report images of infants for ROP screening, the first ROP network to cater to rural India and is currently the world's largest single hospital-managed tele-ROP network. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Blindness; India; Infants; Information technology; Opthalmology; Rural areas

Resnick R.M.,"School market size, growth and the shift to digital resources in k-12 classrooms",2011,"The K-12 instructional materials market, including textbooks, supplemental materials, and digital resources, totaled $16.4 billion in sales in the 2009-2010 school year. It is projected that sales in 2010-2011 will be $17.3 billion, a 5.3% year-to-year increase. There has been a slow down in this market, starting in 2006-2007 and intensifying in 2008-2009, yet the K-12 school market continues to grow at a steady pace despite fluctuations in the U.S. economy. The fundamental fact that student enrollment and per pupil expenditures continue to increase assures us that the K-12 market continues to grow, but it also reinforces the fact that recent years were not banner years for educational publishers. Looking at sales of particular categories of educational products, it is easy to see that the technology-related resources led the pack in a generally difficult sales year in 2009. Big jumps were recorded in terms of sales of interactive whiteboards (+33.98%), online/digital content (+19.0%), and learning management or student information systems (+11.3%) and, to a lesser extent, computing/mobile devices (+3.0%), and instructional software (+1.2%). Looked at another way, if all of the digital product applications are grouped together, this group was up a strong 11.3% in 2009, while the various types of books used by students, as a group, was down 12.7%. These results make it evident that digital resources have not only gained traction in the K-12 school market, they are starting to dominate. In fact, 2009 may be the first year that it became necessary for a company to be heavily invested in digital content/delivery in order to achieve sales success in the non-textbook instructional materials market segment. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Computing/mobile devices; Digital product development; Digital resources; Digital supplements; Educational hardware; Interactive whiteboards; K-12 school market; Learning management systems; Online/digital content; Per pupil expenditures; Print supplements; Student enrollment; Student information systems; Supplemental materials; Textbooks

The requirements for successful website features that build on access and interactivity, however, are not in accord with some consumer surveys that indicate dissatisfaction with online transactions. We argue that access and interactivity alone do not necessarily lead to operational performance (page views and duration), but that the relationship is critically influenced by consumer browsing activities and website characteristics. In this paper, we examine two specific characteristics that are hypothesized to be positively related to the operational performance: the extent to which the activity is search-based versus experience-based, and website characteristics that induce consumer engagement. Using data obtained from 177 Korean websites, our results support our hypotheses. Even so, findings also suggest some confounding features of search and browsing activities. Collectively, this study corroborates contemporary views of consumers as actively engaged in the process of value creation. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Griffy-Brown C.,"Supporting the emergence of women's entrepreneurship: Regulative, institutional and technological changes in Japan",2011,"Purpose – There are a number of reasons why entrepreneurship has struggled in the Japanese context. Since the historical period from post-war Japan until the 1990s, a large-firm “institutional logic” prevailed. For example, in post-war Japan, large dominant firms emerged that were supported by government policies and heavily structured around sub-contracting. Such firms strongly influenced Japanese human and financial capital and, because they offered life-time employment along with better pay and benefits, they quickly became the employment of choice for talented individuals. As a result, few talented people chose to become entrepreneurs, which in turn led to a cycle of sluggish venture capital investment and the perception of high risk. This short perspective-style article aims to focus on the recent institutional changes in Japan which appear to have led to more women engaging in entrepreneurship. Design/methodology/approach – This is a practitioner-oriented piece reporting on work being done to support the emergence of women entrepreneurs in Japan. The author considers whether the recent changes are sufficient to allow women to reach their full potential in the Japanese business landscape. Findings – The fortress of traditional Japanese business, which largely excludes women, appears to be surrounded by the “cloud” of a growing and necessary group of women who are a vital resource amidst Japan's otherwise shrinking labor market. Women consumers played a critical role in the emergence of the digital economy of Japan and are now playing a key role politically. Research limitations/implications – This is only a practitioner-perspective article. Practical implications – A greater understanding of changes in institutional and regulative logic as well as the role of technology could potentially impact policy and practice. Originality/value – This is an original study focussing on the world's second-largest economy and an area of significance for stimulating innovation in the context of Japan. There is also potential for extending theory. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Entrepreneurs; Information technology; Innovation; Japan; Organizational change; Women
"Nemtoi G., Bostan I.",Digital economy and its impact over the personal data and private life protection,2011,"The concept of digital economy or the new economy has performed appreciations over the current transformations of the economic activities, as result of using the digital technologies, which have ensured the access and processing of information. The new economy is characterized by intensifying the knowledge of the new products and services, the increase of technological information importance of innovation, globalization and long lasting development. The volume of information towards some services or products might change the way markets operate, situation that leads towards the accomplishment of a continuous flow of modifying or even restructuring the ole enterprises. New opportunities can also be reevaluated, in order to create value and quality, by information exploitation. The information society signifies the promoter which ensures the economical growth, in conditions of increased protection of the environment, thus accelerating the reduction of physical consumption. All these take place in order to capitalize the information and knowledge, ensuring the movement of the centre from investments, such as real means, towards the human capital investments. This paper aims towards the exemplification of limits drawn between extending the digital economy and the impact that such phenomenon exerts over its users. The adoption of IT opens therefore a wide pallet of services and activities, which any citizens or consumers can use. The paper proposes to emphasize the influence that digital economy has upon the individuals, seen as consumers of information technology, as well upon the level of protection as regards the personal data protection of people.",Digital economy; Informational society; Rights of personal data protection

In recent years many growing or recovering economies have been fueled by ICT driven innovations provided by ICT professionals (Maryska et. al. 2010), which can only happen as long as there is a solid foundation for ICT investment, digital readiness, information technology education, support for research & development, as well as other aspects. (European Commission 2010, Oskrdal 2010, Pavlicek 2010). While most countries and their governing agencies are starting to be aware of the need to have a defined ICT strategy and measurement indicators, a number of them are still missing one, some don't have the necessary agencies with legal mandate to resolve issues of the digital age. At the same time, there are countries with a defined strategy, clear organization scheme and a long-term goal of supporting both economic competitiveness and well-being of all citizens. This paper aims to summarize and (when possible) compare various approaches to measure national ICT governance in select countries that have successfully started the digital transformation and either already are or are becoming the ICT economy hubs of the current world. The synthesized information should provide basic guidelines for ICT metrics. The paper follows up research conducted at University of Economics, Prague, defining ICT's economic and social impact.

"Breznitz D., Kenney M., Rouvinen P., Zysman J., Ylä-Anttila P.",Value capture and policy Design in a Digital Economy,2011,"Pervasive information and communication technology (ICT), intertwined with global dispersion of supply chains, is inducing a sizable structural transformation. All the articles in this special issue highlight that even though technology is the key driver, the reactions of businesses and countries to these transformations will depend on economic, political, and social arrangements within each organization and society. The competitive landscape of the ICT industry itself is likely to remain in flux. Also in other industries, both value creation and value capture are becoming increasingly complex-and remain more favorable for the developed countries than some commonly used measures suggest. According to the prevailing economic thinking, public policies should set market-friendly ""rules of the game"" and then stay out of the way. In the ICT domain, technical standards, spectrum allocations, and market power associated with various types of lock-ins play crucial roles calling for more active public involvement. In particular, the dynamic aspects of competition and anti-trust policies are important yet complex. While there is limited scope for sectoral or horizontal industrial policies, this special issue provides alternative avenues for considering matrix or systemic policies emphasizing education, openness, and national competitiveness. © The Author(s) 2011.",globalization; ICT; industrial policy; structural change; technology
Wang K.,RETRACTED ARTICLE: On ICT and green growth from a sustainable perspective,2011,"The Brundtland Commission in its 1987 report""Our Common Future"" defined sustainability, from then on it became the most frequently quoted definition associated with sustainability and the definition of green economy and green growth appeared in the aftermath. But there's been enough scientific proof that humanbeings seriously lack sustainability, due to the failure of innovative definitions to be transformed into effective actions through policies and strategies supporting green growth. Over the past 10 to 5 years a concensus has emerged that ICT can support the development of green growth in three principal ways. However very little research has conducted on policies and strategies needed to improve transformation of economy, social structure and governance process. The global economic crisis that started in 2008 is a policy turningpoint for the world and its nations to confront the complexities of sustainable development challenges and the definition of green economy and green growth which appeared many decades ago as the product of transformational paradigm was put on global agenda. How to make policies and strategies to gurantee the systemic effects of digital economy support the transformation to green economy will become the realistic choice of nations to improve green growth. © 2011 IEEE.",green growth; ICT; policy turning point; sustainability; systemic effect

A key question which the book seeks to answer is what Asian policy-makers and leaders in government, economy and society can do to further enhance learning and capability formation so as to foster sustainable development in an increasingly globalized world. It addresses the politico-cultural and socio-economic challenges of effectively managing both knowledge resources and coping with the great digital divide created by globalization, continuous technology innovations and rapid external change. A key objective of the publication is to enable latecomers in the knowledge race to understand some of the critical success factors of sustainable knowledge-based development and what it takes to build a resilient knowledge-based economy. © 2011 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

In the view of the financial crisis that brought forth a reaction of risk aversion among investors towards the emerging countries, it is questionable if foreign direct investments are still playing a positive role in the catching up process. We develop an econometric approach based on the VECM methodology that conducts to the impulse-response functions highlighting the interactions between financial and real economy, with a special emphasis on the contributions of foreign direct investments on the dynamic of the variables that capture the state of the macroeconomic environment.

"Banks M., Milestone K.","Individualization, gender and cultural work",2011,"In the 'new' economy the virtues of creative and cultural industry production are widely promoted and idealized. For women, set free from their 'feudal chains', the 'cool creative and egalitarian' cultural economy - particularly in areas such new media, music, design and fashion - appears to offer paths to workplace freedom. But is this really so? Using evidence from the digital 'new media' sector, this article builds on the work of Lash and Adkins that suggests that the ostensibly detraditionalized cultural economy continues to play host to some markedly regressive traditional social structures. In particular it is shown how the new media sector exhibits some clear continuity with the old economy in terms of some enduring gender inequality and discrimination. However, more positively, evidence is presented of how women have been able to take advantage of individualized workplace structures and develop more autonomous and reflexive workplace roles. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Gender; Individualization; New media production; Tradition
"Zhao H., Uchida E., Deng X., Rozelle S.","Do Trees Grow with the Economy? A Spatial Analysis of the Determinants of Forest Cover Change in Sichuan, China",2011,"This paper aims to identify the relationship between economic growth and forest cover change in Sichuan, China. Using a set of panel land use data based on Landsat TM/ETM digital images, we show that during the late 1980s and 1990s, Sichuan's forest cover initially decreased and then rose. We also note that the rising and falling trends occurred at the same time that Sichuan's economy was going through a period of rapid and sustained growth. We use multivariate analysis to identify the determinants of forest cover change. In addition to using a first-differenced estimator, we also utilize spatial error and spatial lag models to obtain consistent and efficient estimates of the determinants of forest cover. Our analysis demonstrates the importance of economic growth on the forest cover change; the results show that there is a U-shaped relationship between forest cover and GDP per capita. However, despite the nature of the empirical relationship between forest cover and income, the high turning point of the U-shaped relationship suggests that there is no evidence for the existence of the Environmental Kuznets Curve for forests in Sichuan Province. Hence, policy interventions may be necessary to stop the decrease of forests. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",China; Economic growth; Environmental Kuznets Curve; Forest resources; Remote sensing; Spatial econometrics
Georgescu M.,The road to distance learning: Issues and pitfalls,2011,"The first steps in e-learning were designed for individual learning. In that stage there were few practical ways to integrate multiple learners or instructors into asynchronous self study elearning.

Sussman G.,Systemic propaganda and state branding in post-soviet eastern Europe,2011,"The informational economy, on which the United States and other leading industrial states have staked the future, is profoundly implicated in a broad range of transformations, similar in scope to the radical changes brought about by the era of the industrial revolution. Transnational capitalism is continually reorganizing not only the system of production, but also the spheres of politics, social relations, knowledge, and cultural practice. Embedded in neoliberal economic and organizational restructuring, the digital mode of development (Castells, 1996) has altered relations among nations in ways that have broken traditional boundaries, territorial and other forms, and the spatial-temporal order of things. Digital capitalism, still mainly headquartered in the West and focused on the informational functions of production, circulation, and consumption, enables those in the promotional fields to push the frontiers of consumerism and the commodification of consciousness. The “sacred” character of nations and states poses no barrier to those wishing to bring them into the fold of spectacular consumption.

Kikuchi T.,"Time zones, communications networks, and international trade",2011,"Advances in digital technology have driven large decreases in the costs of data transfer and telecommunications. There is a consequent increase in many kinds of international trade. One of the fastest-growing parts of this industry is ""remote maintenance"" whereby Indian companies debug software for companies in other parts of the world, often taking advantage of time zone differences to offer overnight service.In the existing literature on trade theory, however, relatively few attempts have been made to address the theme of communications networks and the role of time zones. The main purpose of this book is to illustrate, with simple models of international trade, how the introduction of communications networks and the utilization of time zone differences can affect both the structure of international trade and world welfare. Other technological aspects of recent international trade (e.g., competition between international standards, the impact of switching costs on imported products’ introduction) are also examined.Although a focus on theoretical trade models, the book will appeal to scholars, policy makers and business units who wish to learn from the recent changes in communications networks and its impact on the global economy.

Today,off-shoring continues to generate considerable debate on the long-run impact. Also, there is considerable misunderstanding about this phenomenon. In this paper, the authors make a distinction among the terms outsourcing, offshore outsourcing, and off-shoring. Off-shoring has been facilitated by a deconstruction of the value chain, allowing firms to evaluate all activities as potential candidates for being performed outside the firm. Reasons for the acceleration of offshoring are outlined.

This paper identifies five main areas of Green IT capability and describes the main pillars of a G-readiness framework to help organisations evaluate their maturity for Green IT. The utility of the framework is demonstrated through a desk-based research case study of four organisations. The paper argues that just as e-readiness has been, and continues to be, a critical capability in the digital economy, G-readiness is an equally critical capability in the low carbon digital economy. Without a clear understanding of G-readiness, organisations would approach Green IT initiatives on an ad hoc and somewhat reactive basis, which is undesirable.",Digital business; G-readiness index; Green IT; IT strategy; Sustainable business

Investigating virtual goods pricing and permission strategies,2010,"With the rapid increase of virtual goods created for virtual world exchanges and the record growth of user-to-user transactions in these in-world economies, an important question is how a creator sets prices for a virtual good so as to maximize her profit from her creation. Virtual goods share similar economic properties (such as substantial production cost and negligible marginal cost) with other types of digital goods. However, one aspect that distinguishes a virtual good is that consumers in a virtual world may want to use multiple copies of the identical good at the same time, and such simultaneous use of multiple copies of the identical good increases a consumer's utility. In this research, we focus on the COPY permission of virtual goods.We develop an economic model to examine under what conditions the COPY permission setting leads to the highest profit for the creator of a virtual good, and what the pricing strategies are in a dynamic setting when such permission choices are present.

Barbosa D.B.,On artefacts and middlemen: A musician's note on the economics of copyright,2010,"This article approaches some concrete examples of the economic analysis involving cultural expressions and the ability of intellectual property to respond to economic demands, particularly with regard to the reproductive models in the markets. This analysis appears not to be linked to the substantive levels of the expressive production but rather to the changing role of mediators in such production operating as intermediaries between creators and consumers.

Van Der Meys A.,Manage energy better,2010,"Why smart metering? In today's world, the answer is simple: smart metering helps reduce information costs and it helps everyone at every level to manage energy better. With information more readily available at increasingly competitive prices and an energy resources base that is fast depleting, the face of the world is changing rapidly. This chapter looks at the concept of the collapse of information cost (COI) and how it has affected and shaped a once traditional industry that is undergoing a huge shift - metering. If you are reading this, it is likely that you have a good idea about the concept of globalization and how it directly affects you as an individual (your clothes are designed in the USA, assembled in Asia and finishing touches are given in Europe), and how it affects your business (production has been outsourced to Asia, and you regularly hold video conferences with your colleagues around the world). Globalization is a loose term used to describe the context of many changes within our world. But have you ever thought about the factors, whcih drive globalization? Have you heard about the COI? The COI, articulated by Gordon E. Moore, and called Moore's law, refers to the long-term trend in computing hardware. The idea is that technological development, such as processing speed and memory capacities, is not only increasing rapidly but exponentially, and that this influences the usefulness of digital electronics in nearly every segment of the world economy. The result is that information at every level is more readily available and the face of the world as we know it is changing forever - and at a speed beyond expectation. It also means that, when it comes to business, traditional business models are no longer an option - the dawn of disaggregated value chains began long ago. So how can we cope with this new world order? It is clear that we are experiencing a marked shift between the old and the new world that will see many players left far behind and, on the short- to mid-term, out of the race. Clearly, the objective is to remain in, and hopefully ahead of, the race. For the metering industry, which stands on the verge of vast change, the COI is a key driver. It is influencing the development of the industry as a whole. The winners are the ones who will be able to be flexible, to be able to adapt at a moment's notice, and to be able to forecast future trends. This, however, is easier said than done. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.",
"Guo H., Wu J.",Space science and technology in China: A roadmap to 2050,2010,"Space science, applications and technology are crucially important strategic fields for China. Space science, serving as the driving force of space applications and technology, can not only enrich human's knowledge, but also foster the development of high technologies, in particular space technology. Th e utilization of earth observation is an important part of space applications that maintains a strong connection with human society, noting that it offers fundamental means for sustaining a stable coexistence between man and nature as well as improving the quality of human life. On the other hand, space technology provides strong support for the achievement of the goals of space science and applications. In a word, space science, applications and technology advance forward in mutually beneficial ways, as witnessed in the last few decades. In the first half of the 21st century, China will confront several severe problems: 1) How to take the responsibilities of being a big power and make significant contributions to human civilization. 2) How to promote the development of its high technologies so as to assume a leading role for China in the field of technology. 3) How to effectively protect the environment and improve the quality of life, and 4) How to promote China's development in a sustainable way, etc. Space science, applications and technology will offer numerous eff ective and irreplaceable solutions to the aforementioned problems, which may impede the modernization and development of China. Guided by the national goal of ""Becoming a generally modernized, and moderately developed country by the mid 21st century"", the current report deals with the severe problems that will face China in the future and the signifi cance of space science, applications and technology in the national strategy of development. It investigates the trends of space science, applications and technology in the world and the space strategies of other countries, analyzes the status of China's space development, and in the end suggests the vision, goals and roadmaps for China's space science, applications and technology to 2050. In this report, a particular emphasis is put on space science, earth observation, digital earth, and related space technologies. Th e vision of China's space science, applications and technology to 2050 is as follows: To radically elevate the status of space science, applications and technology in the nation's development, in the course of following the national demands and key scientifi c and technological questions, such that by 2050 they may play key roles in national development, being able to provide eff ective and irreplaceable solutions to the major problems facing the nation. Th e strategic goals for space science, applications and technology to 2050 are as follows: Strategic Goal 1 (Strategic goal of space science): Exploration and research should be conducted on cutting-edge and unsolved scientifi c questions as well as the basic scientifi c questions. Original breakthroughs should be made in directly detecting black holes, dark matter, dark energy and gravitational waves, studying the origin and evolution of the solar system and the infl uence of solar activities on earth environment as well as its forecasting, and exploring life elsewhere. It is expected that space science research in China will be fully improved to the point such that China, with some remarkable scientific achievements, can make decisive contributions to human civilization. By performing scientific research towards Strategic Goal 1, some significant progress is expected in answering the following scientifi c questions: 1. How did the universe originate and evolve? 2. How did life originate and how does it continue to evolve? What's the survival behavior of life including man in outer space? 3. How do the sun and solar system affect the earth, thus in turn the survival and development of human society? 4. Are there any laws beyond the existing fundamental physical theories to be discovered? 5. What are the laws of motion for matter in space? Strategic Goal 2 (Strategic goal of space applications) Regarding the construction of earth observation infrastructure, Digital Earth Scientifi c Platform and Earth System Simulation Network Platform, the spatial data will be comprehensively applied to the modeling and forecasting of climate change, water circulation and water-safety related problems, carbon circulation, and ecological-environmental change, land-cover change and sudden and unexpected natural disasters, as well as to searching for new sources of energy and natural resources. Th e capability of the country to utilize space technology to support its development should be fostered to a whole new level, thus to turn China into a more competitive nation in space applications. Breakthroughs are expected in the fi elds concerning the handling of energy and resource shortages, ecological deterioration and serious natural disasters. The following questions are expected to be answered in accordance with Strategic Goal 2: (1) How do global environmental changes aff ect China? (2) What are the major driving factors for the regional changes in China, and what are the possible response mechanisms? (3) What are the typical spatial and temporal scales and the governing laws for the impact of environmental change? (4) How to improve the ability for the detection, simulation and prediction of such global changes? (5) How to apply spatial data to the survey of resources? Strategic Goal 3 (Strategic goal of space technology) Th e fundamental goal of space technology is to provide strong technical support for space science and applications. Towards this end, China has to make appreciable advancements in developing ultra-high resolution observation, ultra-high precision spatial and time standards, light-weight and miniature spacecrafts and payloads, near-space vehicles, ultra-high speed flight in deep space and autonomous navigation, and permanent human residence in space, etc. Priority should be put on the development of key technologies that otherwise may impede the progress of China's space science and applications, aiming at attaining the capability to support China's future space activities, and to promote the development of relevant high technologies. China's roadmap for space science, applications and technology to 2050 is illustrated in Fig. 0.1. Since the beginning of the 21st century, more and more countries have been involved in space exploration, regarded as one of the main thrusts for the nation's science, technology, economy and society. China also strives to play an important role in this field, so as to be able to take the responsibility in making contributions to human civilization, in improving the quality of human life, and in protecting earth environment, and so forth, through which China can be more competitive in the world, particularly in science and technology, and accomplish the Great Rejuvenation.

This research uses the concept of Internet marketing theory to understand the path to website success (WSS), and uses a Structure Equation Model to build an integrated cause-effect relationship model for WSS, in order to explore Internet customisation (IC), website design quality, and Internet marketing strategy (IMS); which have been identified as key drivers of a WSS by previous research. To provide a deeper analysis this research also tests for intervening variables that affect a WSS. The results confirm that all three variables positively influence WSS, and show that IMS is an intervening variable between IC and WSS. From a practical perspective, this research shows that businesses must engage in IC planning and create IMS to attract consumers to browse and purchase products from their website. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.",Internet Customisation; Internet Marketing Strategy; Website Design Quality; Website Success
Manwaring K.,Network neutrality: Issues for Australia,2010,"The beginning of the 21st century saw the beginning of substantial debate on ""open access"" to the Internet and the related concept of ""network neutrality"". This paper is a short introduction to some of the complexities of the debate, focussing on the difficulties of attempting to regulate rapidly developing technologies, as well as particular issues of price and market regulation in Australia. Generally, network neutrality advocates believe that without regulation, telecommunications companies will use their control over ""last mile"" infrastructure to engage in discriminatory and anti-competitive practices against content providers. Opponents argue that this concern is illusory, and regulatory restrictions requiring neutrality will in their turn restrict innovation by network providers. In Australia, most discussion has focussed on price and market regulation. However, many Australian opponents of network neutrality say that it is an American problem, irrelevant to Australia, because of different pricing models for the Australian broadband market. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Coudray M.,Why the economy is broken and we won't return to business as usual,2010,"Mark Coudray, president of Coudray Graphic Technologies, states that rules of business have changed significantly and printing shops need to adopt certain rules to do business and grow. The key to success in the existing information driven, expanding digital economy is to have a market that expands as quickly as the technology. A change in policy and strategy is required to achieve success under these conditions. There are two things needed to enable this kind of growth, such as develop and enhance the skill of using online searches to find and reach new customers through the use of keyword searches and search engine optimization (SEO) for websites. The ability printing shops to position their goods and services so a big pool of potential customers who can find them and buy their offerings is essential.",
Palan S.,Digital options and efficiency in experimental asset markets,2010,"In asset markets, extraordinary price run-ups (bubbles) followed by crashes back to levels closer to fundamental values have been shown to adversely affect the real economy, leading to inefficient resource allocation and underinvestment. Conversely, derivative markets contribute to price discovery and lead to informationally more efficient prices in the market for the underlying asset. We combine these observations and test experimentally whether digital options - a type of derivative that has recently been introduced to a wider audience via online prediction markets - can reduce price bubbles in a laboratory setting. We find that subjects do not use the derivative market to improve their expectations of future asset prices and analyze this result. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Asset market; Bubble; Digital option; Efficiency; Experimental economics
"Gordon L.A., Loeb M.P., Sohail T.",Market value of voluntary disclosures concerning information security,2010,"Information security is a fundamental concern for corporations operating in today's digital economy. The number of firms disclosing items concerning their information security on reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Com-mission (SEC) has increased in recent years. A question then arises as to whether or not there is value to the voluntary disclosures concerning information security. Thus, the primary objective of this paper is to assess empirically the market value of voluntary disclosures of items pertaining to information security. Based on a sample of 1,641 disclosing and 19,266 non-disclosing firm-years in a cross-sectional pooled model, our primary findings provide strong evidence that voluntarily disclosing items concerning information security is associated positively with the market value of a firm. These findings are based on the use of a market-value relevance model, as well as a bid-ask spread analysis. The study's findings are robust to alternative statistical analyses. The findings also provide support for the signaling argument, which states that managers disclose information in a manner consistent with increased firm value. Finally, the study findings provide some insight into the strategic choice that firms make regarding voluntary disclosures about information security.",Bid-ask spread; Information security; Market value; Selection-bias; Voluntary disclosures

"Neogi P.K., Cordell A.J.","The internet and the need for governance: Learning from the past, coping with the future",2010,"Every economy requires a physical, institutional and legal infrastructure, as well as understandable and enforceable marketplace rules, in order to function smoothly. In this paper the authors maintain that the building of such an infrastructure, which provides trust and confidence for all those who operate in or are affected by it, is a necessary condition for the development and efficient functioning of a global, digital economy. They also show that costs will result if the global economy has to function on the basis of distrust, both at the individual and transaction level. Although the Internet has transformed the economy, society and politics, it was never designed and built for global, ubiquitous and secure commercial use. While the technology is new, the need for trust, confidence and security remains. The Internet is an open network where there is no outside body that can administer sanctions. In this respect, it appears to be unique in commercial history. One characteristic of the public Internet is that, since it consists of many thousands of autonomous networks spanning a large number of jurisdictions, it has no well defined oversight mechanism that can administer sanctions. Drawing upon the lessons of history and historical analogies, the authors indicate some possible solutions. For the Internet to achieve its maximum social and political potential there will have to be agreed upon and effective rules of the road, both nationally and globally. © Neogi and Cordell, 2010.",Governance; Internet; Oversight; Trust

Shixin I.Z.,"Chinese newspaper ownership, corporate strategies, and business models in a globalizing world",2010,"This study takes Beijing Youth Daily (BYD), Beijing's largest newspaper in terms of advertising revenue and second largest in terms of circulation, as a case study to examine and analyze how globalization influences the ownership, corporate strategies, and business models of local newspaper organizations in China; and, thus, accelerates Chinese-style capitalism and media convergence. Declining advertising revenue and the loss of readers due to the digital revolution and the availability of multimedia news channels are global challenges that face newspapers around the world. BYD is no exception. In response, BYD has shifted from an exclusively state ownership model to a split or dual-track management model that has allowed foreign capital into the business operations while the party/state still retains ideological control over the news content. BYD has reoriented its corporate strategies and carried out structural reforms, building a media conglomerate via new titles, acquisitions, concentrations, and convergences; and developed its business models with advertising as a major revenue source. All these measures are market-oriented and intended to maximize newspaper profits by pursuing economies of scale and scope. © Institute for Media and Communications Management.",

Yet, the speed of reforms have been remarkably different across countries. We empirically investigate this cross-sectional and temporal variation in entry liberalization of OECD countries during the 1990s. A unique data set obtained by merging different sources on political, government and regulatory institutions - as well as private interests and ideologies - allows us to explore in detail several dimensions of the political economy of liberalization. Our findings indicate majoritarian electoral systems as important drivers for change, while independent industry regulators slow down such reforms. Furthermore, powerful industry incumbents hold up the liberalization process and governing bodies that favor a small welfare state accelerate it.

Economists call for investments in technologies that enable innovations and spur economic development in the country. In addition to being the source of innovation, economic growth also depends on the ability of nations to absorb and apply new innovations that germinated elsewhere. Despite accumulating evidence that several factors play an important role in the assimilation of new technologies, the drivers of the adoption of digital technologies are not well understood and the findings remain inconsistent. Based on theories of economic growth and innovation diffusion theory, and using the well-known takeoff phenomenon as the underpinning, we hypothesise and empirically examine the relationships between human capital (literacy, life expectancy), cost, international trade (foreign direct investment), communications infrastructure (television and telephone) and the takeoff of digital technologies. Our findings confirm that important differences exist among the high-, medium- and low-income countries with respect to the takeoff times for ICT. In addition, our study reveals the differential impact of the factors on takeoff for the three income groups. Policy implications include the need for tailoring the adoption programmes based on country income group, technology type and adoption stage (before or after takeoff).

Auction websites, such as eBay and Amazon, as well as more sophisticated platforms, such as Moai and FrictionlessCommerce have increased transaction volume by offering tailored auction protocols to specific customer groups. meet2trade is a generic electronic market platform that supports various auction mechanisms. This study examines the impact of a discount in a second-price, sealed-bid mechanism on bidding behavior and market outcomes. Emphasis is thereby placed on bidders' system-based perceptions, beliefs about usage and institutional-based trust, and intention to use such an auction. Ninety students were recruited to participate in an experiment held at a Western European university. The experiment observed user behavior in second-price auctions with and without a discount. The results demonstrate that although discounts do affect bidding behavior and economic outcomes, they do not influence bidder's intentions to use such auction mechanisms. Instead, we found that intention to use is influenced by institutional and usage beliefs that are shaped by system-based perceptions, which in turn provide specific advice to market engineers on the technical aspects influencing system adoption. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Auction assessment model; Auction with discount; Electronic auction systems; Laboratory experiment; Meet2trade

Conceiving ways of doing things has traditionally been regarded as a necessarily distinct process from the actual execution of activities. This notion is embedded across the majority of established enterprise management approaches. But managerial intentions and actions are becoming intertwined in many enterprises. Decision-based thinking does not necessarily always precede managerial action.

Van Den Broek D.,From terranova to terra firma: A critique of the role of free labour and the digital economy,2010,"On-going class action against America Online's use of 'free labour' has divided opinion about the management of 'digital' labour in the 'new' economy. Web-based systems of collaboration between and within firms and their customers, as well as customer engagement in product innovation, have underscored claims about the evaporation of traditional labour markets and labour processes as well as about (weakening) divisions between production and consumption. This has led to (exaggerated) debates about the contribution of free' or 'immaterial' labour to contemporary economies. This paper argues that while significant restructuring has changed traditional organisational forms, capital markets remain centralised and digital labour remains as regulated as other labour. As such, while labour cannot be fully commodified, digital labour is neither free or immaterial, because it is not the content of labour itself, but rather its relationship with capital that gives it 'weight' and value.",

The chapter introduces a skilling framework which integrates pedagogical, organisational and technological values to promote the uptake of knowledge economy skills. Design/methodology/approach – An exploratory study approach was adopted underpinned by a social constructionist epistemology. The study fused a literature review on knowledge economy skills and women’s learning needs with a desktop audit of opportunities available to women entrepreneurs to augment their knowledge economy skills. Findings – Based on the two sets of data, the study found that a lack of attention has been paid to increasing female entrepreneurs’ opportunities to develop to their full potential in the knowledge economy. Most training programmes fall short in delivering comprehensive digital and strategic skills required for women entrepreneurs’ full participation in a knowledge society. Research limitations/implications: Given the exploratory study approach, researchers are encouraged to adopt and test the proposed framework. Practical implications – The interlinking of business and technology offers unique opportunities for women to engage in entrepreneurship and innovation. For policy makers this analysis provides insights on how to foster female entrepreneurship in the knowledge economy. For educators it provides a teaching and learning framework that encompasses evidence based content, gender-sensitive approaches to business skilling and collaborative learning environments.

For customers to be satisfied data protection and privacy are prerequisite for obtaining quality information. Information gathered may be transformed through a system of business intelligence into a complete enterprise resource planning system. This results in creation of integrated business systems. Using the innovative solutions enables integration of customers, partners and suppliers in a virtual network that is oriented to the end users. The challenge for the companies in the future is introducing the concept of electronic customer relationship management - CRM to increase productivity and profits of the company and thus gain a sustainable competitive advantage. Companies are increasingly exploring the market and searching the best ways to meet needs and requirements of their customers.

"Carter R.B., Strader T.J.",Software firm Cost structure and its impact on iPos in the e-commerce era,2010,"The first decade of the e-commerce era saw an increase in activity in the software development industries as new firms were created and existing firms made acquisitions. Many firms pursued a growth strategy and this growth required capital that was often obtained through an initial public offering (IPO) of equity. Software firm cost structures are very different from traditional physical goods firms because their marginal costs are much lower, but what is not known is whether this affects their financing strategies. In this study we compare software firm and traditional firm IPOs using data from 780 IPOs offered during the late dot-com era (1998- 2002) to identify differences in firm and offer characteristics, investment risk, initial returns, and underwriting activity. We find that the characteristics and performance of software firm IPOs are significantly different from IPOs offered by traditional firms during this time period providing supporting for our conclusion that firm cost structure should be considered when analyzing IPOs and other strategic issues.

"Majors I., Stale G.",Application of enterprise modeling and knowledge management for educational information technology in SMEs,2010,"Nowadays, an enterprise has to be flexible and adaptable to new market and rapidly changing global economic situations. Moreover, the global economic crisis has added an alarming dimension to this scenario and made the discovery of new solutions extremely urgent. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) must become learning organizations, so that the whole company can learn while it works and be able to adapt quickly to market changes and other environmental conditions. Ecosystem approach more precisely matches SMEs needs to become and remain competitive in turbulent business environment. Second key issue in new economical situation is effective knowledge management. The knowledge economy demands that organizations integrate their activities, processes and systems to exploit their resources more efficiently and subsequently gain economies of scale and access to and from new market. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate application of enterprise modeling (EM) and knowledge management for educational information technology (IT) in SMEs.

"Martínez-Torres M.R., Toral S.L., Barrero F., Cortés F.",The role of Internet in the development of future software projects,2010,"Purpose: The Internet has evolved, prompted in part by new Web 2.0 technologies, to become a more widespread platform for interaction, communication, and activism. Virtual communities, or groups of people informally bound together by shared expertise, synthesise this Internet evolution and the Web 2.0 technology. Users increasingly want to engage online with one another and with organisations of all kinds. These novel Internet-based technologies dominate the new business models of the digital economy giving companies radical new ways to harvest the talents of innovators working outside corporate boundaries. One of the most illustrative examples of this new trend is the Open Source Software (OSS) projects development. This paper aims to analyse the structure and topology of the virtual community supporting one of the most successfully OSS projects, Linux. The objective is to provide conclusions for being successful in the development of future virtual communities. As companies learn to manage these virtual communities, they will develop smarter and faster ways to create value through them. Design/methodology/approach: The interactions of the virtual community members of an ARM-embedded Linux project website is analysed through social network analysis techniques. The participants' activity is studied and some conclusions about the participation features are obtained using the Gini coefficient. In particular, a participation inequality behaviour or a concentration on a small number of developers is clearly observed. Findings: The paper deals with the guidelines that virtual communities should follow to be successful. Results about the structure of a successful virtual community and its time evolution are provided to determine the mentioned guidelines. Research limitations/implications: The research is limited to a particular virtual community engaged with the development of the ARM-embedded Linux OSS. Other successful virtual communities can be analysed, and the conclusions could be compared. Anyway, the proposed analysis methodology can be extended to other virtual communities. Originality/value: The paper fulfils the development and features of Internet virtual communities to be successful. Results have important implications over the development of new software business models based on virtual communities and open source software. Contributions about the best organisation of virtual communities leading to a successful development of the underlying project are presented. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Communities; Computer software; Information transfer; Internet; Social networks

"Benghozi P.-J., Gille L., Vallée A.",Innovation and regulation in the digital age: A call for new perspectives,2009,"Relations between innovation and regulation are all but fluid and simple. When innovation, beyond just developing new techniques, means redefining the very framework for implementing and operating technologies, it often means breaking the rules, challenging them. In the digital economy, the way it overturns the regulation and rule setting system is particularly radical. Innovation is key to create competitive advantage in a highly dynamic sector such as information and communications technologies. Firms invest heavily in productive resources and take steps to protect their competitive advantage. Productive resources are either network and connection infrastructure or consumer control which is rarely seen as such. It could be consumer's attention or visits which requires massive investments in content, for example. It does include intermediation platform like search engine, programs, knowledge, entertainment and other immaterial products of the digital age. There is a need to rethink regulation on the basis of innovation and mobilization of these productive resources. The digital economy calls for a more holistic consideration of the link between innovation and mobilization of value on the one hand, and regulation on the other. © 2009 Physica-Verlag Heidelberg.",
Harangus D.,Communication dimension in bank activity,2009,"The aggressive increase of competition in the bank environment led to the re-dimensioning of client relationships. For the consolidation of their position on the bank market, the banks switched from a new communication dimension in bank activity. The communication dimension within bank activity is determined by a multitude of factors which can influence the attitudes and behaviour of bank customers as well as the way they perceive the banking and financial services. In the context of world economy globalisation the banks have started using the electronic communication means. These are the only way of distributing bank services without the need of direct human relationship. The communication with clients in the electronic environment offers a great deal of advantages, among which the most important is the accessibility of bank services. The customers have the opportunity to use bank services whenever and wherever they want without being constrained by time or space. At the beginning of the third millennium, in the so-called era of ""Digital Economy"", the banks have had to find new dimensions in their communication with customers. The communication dimension determines success in banking activities, bringing with it performance and a plus of image and credibility for the bank. © 2009 by MIPRO.",

After a public consultation, it was decided that the e-Mexico strategy was going to be organized into four 'content pillars': e-economy, e-health, e-government, and e-learning. The e-learning pillar had the objective of fostering the information society in Mexico through the creation of meaningful content in Spanish for continuing learning and education, and the deployment of thousands of Digital Community Centers (DCC) to make the content of the four pillars available to individuals with no access to Internet. Project leaders and managers originally had great expectations and were envisioning substantial economic and social impacts. However, there were multiple challenges throughout the implementation process and, although the progress in public infrastructure deployment was important, the economic and social impacts are modest in comparison to the initial expectations.

"Cherry C.R., Gottesfeld P.",Plans to distribute the next billion computers by 2015 creates lead pollution risk,2009,"Major computer and software companies, along with governments and philanthropic organizations have embarked on ambitious plans to put computers in the hands of more than one billion new computer users over the next five to six years in untapped markets in emerging economies. The most frequently proposed solution to overcome the electricity shortfall in communities where new computer users will be located is to use rechargeable lead-acid batteries to provide primary and back-up power for computers. This paper calculates the lead emissions from battery manufacturing and recycling that will result if independent market projections to greatly expand the number, geographic, and socioeconomic distribution of computer users are realized. By examining several possible scenarios, we estimate that between 1250 and 2300 kt of lead - between four and seven times the weight of the Empire State Building - could be released into the environment in the developing world to provide power to computers sold through 2015. Increased lead exposure has a negative impact on children's neurological development as measured by reduced school performance and on standardized tests. In order to realize the educational achievement and economic development benefits of reducing the ""digital divide"" proponents will need to encourage improvements in lead battery production and recycling in targeted markets. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

"Welfens P.J.J., Borbély D.","Structural change, growth and bazaar effects in the single EU market",2009,"Economic globalization is a major challenge for the EU15 group which is facing both the challenges of EU eastern enlargement and of economic globalization -in particular this means the rise of ASEAN and China (plus India) in the world economy. In a world economy with overall growth, regional economic catching up and continued technological progress, Europe will have to develop a new pattern of economic specialization; this will include digital modernization and the growth of the information and communication technology sector. As regards the expansion of ASEAN countries and China it is crucial to analyse in which fields they have achieved a comparative advantage in trade with EU15 and to sketch the pattern of export unit value (EVU) dynamics. We expect from a theoretical perspective that both east European accession countries and Asian countries should achieve an absolute rise of export unit values in key sectors over time; the notion of key sectors is, however, ambiguous because the most important sectors in terms of export revenues (or patenting or employment) are changing over time. Economictechnological catching up should go along with a growing emphasis on an improvement of the revealed comparative advantage (RCA) in skill and knowledge intensive sectors. One also may anticipate that export unit values in key sectors rise relative to a benchmark country which often is the US. © 2009 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",
Dolgin A.,The economics of symbolic exchange,2009,"The book addresses the mechanisms of culture in the digital age. Its author, professor at Higher School of Economics, tackles a number of highly relevant issues: the modus operandi of culture in a market environment, the role of money in the process and some methods intended to help consumers in the choice of cultural goods which best meet their tastes in a situation of ever increasing commercial cultural output. The economics of symbolic exchange is a branch of economic science dealing with ""personality resources"" such as free time, attention, emotions, etc. At present, these assets are virtually unaccounted for, nor used, due to the inherent impossibility of their measurement. As a result, more often than not, the economic thought entering the field of culture proves quite helpless. The book provides ample factual evidence relating to a whole range of cultural markets: record industry, book publishing, fashion, network resources and others. Special mention is made of the ""grey"" segments of the economy, such as the role of pirates and illicit dealers, or the activities of semi-legal file sharing services enabling free downloads of music and video material in the cyberspace. These glimpses into the ""grey"" territory expose holes in the ""white"" markets and contest certain myths. The material collected in the book comes down to quite a novel outlook on numerous phenomena of contemporary culture. The key purpose of this work is to introduce into practice some new management tools which are essential for the success of any economic changes in the field of culture, including recommendatory services operating as a social institution of expert consumer analysis of cultural goods and services. © Alexander Dolgin and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2009.",
"Bers J.A., Dismukes J.P.",Accelerated radical innovation - The execution side lessons from a seed-stage technology incubator,2009,"The Accelerated Radical Innovation (ARI) Methodology is an integrated approach to shepherding radical innovation from initial vision through commercialization and integration into the economy within acceptable levels of risk, cost, and schedule. Extending over the full life cycle of the innovation, the methodology encompasses two major periods, an inception period (identification and assessment of four key challenge areas, comprehensive intelligence gathering and analysis leading to a detailed system vision of the innovation), and an implementation period (execution on the system vision through full commercialization). Most of the ARI methodology development to date has focused on the analytical aspects of the inception period. This paper focuses on the post-vision execution period. To understand how execution is successfully carried out in practice, the authors conducted a detailed study of an investor-funded seed-stage innovation incubation firm (ConduIT Corp.) and four of the seed-stage companies in its portfolio. Six factors were found to underlie ConduIT's success: (1) careful culling of innovation concepts for evidence of market need, manageable technical risk, and alignment of business interests; (2) an ultra-lean operating model to improve survivability through the innovation's ""valley of death;"" (3) creation of a business model to assure profitable commercialization; (4) internally provided coaching and professional services by ConduIT's principals; (5) strict accountability based on attainment of milestones; and (6) concentration within ConduIT's defined ecology (health care IT, digital media, and Web-based applications) so that its expertise and network can be used to greatest effect. ConduIT's experience offers five important lessons for radical innovation. First, an extended process of experimentation with products, strategies, and business models is needed. Second, early infusions of capital can create premature, counterproductive financial pressures on the innovator. Third, on the contrary, ConduIT has demonstrated that the early-stage experimentation process can be accomplished at a low burn rate (the ""bootstrapping"" approach), allowing fundamental concepts of the business to gel. Fourth, at the earliest stages of a technology enterprise, a large dose of improvisation in unavoidable. Last, the bootstrapping model forces innovators to go directly to the source of problems (rather than papering over them with cash), leading ultimately to a more agile, resilient, survivable enterprise. The lessons offered by ConduIT are incorporated as best practices into the ARI methodology. © 2009 PICMET.",

"Jin Z., Yanping L.",The co-evolution between companies within E-supply chain management in the era of digital economy,2009,"Fast development of information and communication technology enables the transformation from traditional supply chain to e-supply chain. In this evertransforming environment, effectiveness and efficiency of e-supply chain depend on the coherence between characteristics of the environment and relationships among companies. In order to analysis the relationship management among companies in concert with changes of the environment, this paper seeks to adopt a co-evolutionary perspective. By considering the e-supply chain as the ecosystem combined by business and technology ecosystem, a co-evolutionary framework is established to investigate the interactions among companies from both macro-layer and micro-layer. The Logistic model is used to analysis the value creation produced in this system when individual company co-evolves with other companies. The co-evolutionary theoretical framework and modeling analysis in this paper discuss the interactions of companies in the e-supply chain, and explore the value creation for companies in the process of co-evolving. © 2009 IEEE.",Co-evolution; E-supply chain; Modeling analysis; Theoretical framework

"Murthy N.R.V., Nath R.",Determinants of digital access: A global empirical analysis,2009,"The impact of economic freedom and income inequality on Digital Access Index (DAI) is examined using data from 118 countries. Two variables 'openness of the economy' and the 'extent of domestic credit to private sector' are used as controlled variables. Regression analysis shows that economic freedom, openness of the economy and the extent of domestic credit to the private sector have a positive impact on DAI. Furthermore, greater income inequality has a significant negative relationship with DAI. However, when countries are divided into high income, middle income and low income groups, the results are different. For low income countries, openness of the economy and the extent of domestic credit to the private sector are the only variables that are significantly positively related to DAI. In high income and middle income countries, all variables are significant with the exception of 'openness of the economy'. The paper concludes with a discussion of the policy implications of the results for IT strategists, policymakers and international development agencies.

"Clarke T., Clarke E.",Born digital? Pedagogy and computer-assisted learning,2009,"Purpose - The purpose of this article is to examine the impact of the shift to a knowledge society, where information and communication technology (ICT) and the widening spread of internationally distributed information are creating a ""skill revolution"", as O'Hara suggests, there is a widening culture mismatch between what members of the knowledge society need to succeed and what current systems of higher education are geared to offer and to adequately prepare people and communities to thrive in the global knowledge society. Design/methodology/approach - For universities, as the scope and complexity of the actual business environment grows, the changing landscape of business education needs to come to terms with a developing global environment that has impacted on business, demographics and culture which demands a change in managerial skills to lead sustainable enterprise. Findings - Students need to master higher-order cognitive, affective, and social skills not central to mature industrial societies, but vital in a knowledge based economy that include ""thriving on chaos"" (making rapid decisions based on incomplete information to resolve novel situations); the ability to collaborate with a diverse team - face-to-face or across distance - to accomplish a task; creating, sharing, and mastering knowledge through filtering a sea of quasi-accurate information. Originality/value - These skills, according to Galerneau and Zibit, are ""the skills for the twenty-first century"", as they are ""the skills that are necessary to succeed in an ever changing global society where communications is ubiquitous and instantaneous, and where software tools allow for a range of creative and collaborative options that yield new patterns and results that we are only beginning to see"". © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Communication technologies; Computer based learning; Education; Knowledge economy

It opposes the recent tendency to build up an evolutionary economic geography as an alternative not only to the so-called ""New Economic Geography"" (namely ""geographical mainstream economics"") but also to the institutional economic geography. The paper advocates the development of an evolutionary and institutional approach in economic geography, which would be meso-focused.

"Penaluna A., Penaluna K.",Creativity in Business/Business in Creativity: Transdisciplinary Curricula as an Enabling Strategy in Enterprise Education,2009,"Recent guidance for UK government policy makers has warned that HEIs face an uncertain future and has advocated transdisciplinary curricula. Earlier, in 2005, two other UK government papers highlighted the advantages of integrating design-related strategies into business environments and addressed the impact creativity could have on business performance. A key recommendation was to strengthen the relationships between businesses, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and creative professionals from design disciplines who could positively affect business performance and provide digital media, industrial design, packaging, graphic design, branding and advertising. If the successful entrepreneur has personal skills, attributes and behaviours that extend beyond the purely commercial, HEIs need to develop students with capabilities that meet the entrepreneurial challenges of the knowledge economy. This paper draws on entrepreneurship and business education strategies that have evolved out of art and design disciplines at Swansea Metropolitan University in the UK. The authors argue that curriculum development should incorporate ‘business’ acumen in all programmes outside business schools and should develop the fundamental skills for developing and exploiting ‘creativity’ in programmes within them. The provision of a symbiotic experience of business and creativity across the curriculum has many benefits, not least because it responds to calls from entrepreneurship educators for a paradigm shift to develop right-brain entrepreneurial capabilities as well as left-brain analytical skills. Such pedagogies are well-established in the design disciplines and the evidence suggests that they are important as a wide-reaching, cross-disciplinary enabling strategy. © 2009, © 2009 SAGE Publications.",creativity in business; design disciplines; designers; entrepreneurship education; experiential education; transdisciplinary
"Sharma R.S., Samuel E.M., Ng E.W.J.",Beyond the digital divide: Policy analysis for knowledge societies,2009,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to report the results of using the framework in the field for the purpose of formulating knowledge policies. The framework derives from a conceptual model for analyzing knowledge development overviewed by the authors in a previous paper. Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses the conceptual framework of 13 dimensions for knowledge policy-making analysis and qualitative focus group discussions by means of what is known as a knowledge SWOTanalysis. Such an exercise ordinarily determines what is termed as net strength (strengths offset by weaknesses) and net opportunity (opportunities offset by threats). Findings - The field research suggests that, whereas quantitative indicators are very commonly used for the purpose of benchmarking and progress tracking, they are limited in terms of determining causes, effects and encapsulating good practices. The present framework provides a means for policy-makers and analysts to engage in discussion, debates, story-telling and scenario building in order to understand net strengths and opportunities. Research limitations/implications - The research is limited by the time constraints of the focus group participants and it is not feasible to conduct a K-SWOT of more than the four societies used for the reason that there are insufficient numbers of informed participants. Practical implications - Developing the knowledge economy has to be more than a management of socio-economic indicators. Understanding the net strength and opportunity faced by a society in the context of a global knowledge economy allowed insights into gaps that may be addressed with appropriate knowledge policies. There is much work to be done in formulating implementable policy recommendations. Originality/value - It is hoped that a useful and valid policy analysis tool for knowledge development has thus been described. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Information strategy; Intellectual capital; Knowledge economy; National cultures; Sustainable development
Oppenheim E.,The medium of action in a slow-moving economy,2009,Ellen Oppenheim states that magazines provide marketing agencies better return on investment (ROI) in comparison with other media under existing adverse economic conditions. She states that marketing agencies need to adopt effectiveness-based planning to improve the performance of advertising and fulfill their objectives and costs. Effectiveness-based planning encourage people to procure their products or services by building purchase intent at the lowest cost. Researchers working in the field reveal that magazines play a key role in improving marketing strategies and returns for marketing agencies when purchase intent becomes the marketing objective. Data from Mediamark Research & Intelligence also show that magazines and digital media together play a key role in improving ROI of marketing agencies.,

Sommer R.A.,A planning solution for virtual business relationships,2009,"Purpose - This paper aims to show that the planning-oriented reference model is a conceptual approach that may provide a more complete alignment of strategic information, governance constructs, as well as process and information flows in the development of virtual partnerships. Design/methodology/approach - The research consists of a literature review along with interviews and observations recorded from previous public/private sector engagements in virtual planning and process change initiatives. Findings - There are very few references that directly address the alignment of strategic plans, governance, and processes within the context of a reusable reference model library. Hence, such an approach may have merit in enhancing the body of knowledge associated with virtual business planning efforts. Practical implications - If narrative strategic planning and policy information can be aligned and subsequently formally documented within a process-oriented reference model structure, the resultant blueprint may be helpful in facilitating the rapid formation of virtual business partnership. Originality/value - In a global economy competitive advantage will increasingly depend on how quickly organizations are able to reorganize in response to changing demand and market condition. Hence, virtual relationships will play an important role in the competitive challenges of the twenty-first century. The framework proposes the use of reusable, process-based planning libraries that could reduce the time and complexity associated with the formation, maintenance, and dissolution of virtual partnerships. © 2009 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Vukanovic Z.,Global paradigm shift: Strategic management of new and digital media in new and digital economics,2009,"The purpose of this conceptual article is to outline and explain a global paradigm shift in strategic management of new and digital media in the age of new and digital economics. Accordingly, this article presents an analysis of the 5 most-successful international media conglomerates (Time Warner, Walt Disney Co., News Corporation, CBS Corp., and Bertelsmann AG) in regards to their annual revenue, profit, and stock growth, as well as total debt to equity. The article finds that 4 out of the 5 firms are American (Time Warner, Walt Disney Co., News Corporation, and CBS Corp.), and 1 is German (Bertelsmann AG). For the most part, 6 factors are particularly dominant in explaining the profitable growth of leading international media conglomerates at the macrolevel: cross-media content distribution leveraging and repurposing, innovation management, vertical integration, vertical expansion, media diversification, and large number of shareholders. To more effectively position and leverage new paradigmatic models largely influencing volatile media markets, this article proposes the creation and adoption of repurposed media content and economies of aggregation (triple- and quadruple-play bundling strategies and network externalities) for the emerging Internet Protocol TV, Internet TV, and the mobile-TV markets. © Institute for Media and Communications Management.",
"Hsu C., Spohrer J.C.",Improving service quality and productivity: Exploring the digital connections scaling model,2009,"The basic model argues that Digital Connections Scaling (DCS) of customers, providers and/or resources is a fundamental way to reduce service cycle time and transaction cost, and thereby to improve service quality and productivity. Digitisation makes entities connectable, and scaling decreases the marginal cost for the customer and the provider to cocreate new values. Three types of economies of DCS are postulated: the accumulation effect, the networking effect and the ecosystem effect on facilitating value propositions and cocreation. The paper also presents enterprise engineering principles, new micro-economic production functions, and an extended cyber-infrastructure model to substantiate DCS.

Kurfi A.K.,Corporate capital structure and lease financing practices of selected manufacturing firms in Nigeria,2009,"This study examines lease financing practices and corporate capital structure of selected Nigerian manufacturing firms. The study determines the extent to which the firms employ lease financing as a means of digital assets acquisitions and the impact on corporate capital structure. A survey method was adopted in selecting a sample of manufacturing firms listed in the Nigehrian Stock Exchange. The financial statements of the sampled manufacturing firms for ten year period (1993-2002) were analyzed and also structured questionnaires and interviews were granted to the financial managers of the firms. The findings of the study reveal that: leasing is a veritable alternative for capital assets acquisitions and that lease constitute about 50% of their total fixed assets because most of the lease contracts are structured with provision for ultimate purchase by the lessee (the firm) after the primary lease term to finance capital assets acquisition. The study recommends that appropriate legislations should be promulgated to boost leasing business in the country and that lease financing should be encouraged to enhance the gearing ratios of the enterprises and a vibrant leasing industry should be created that would make productive assets easily leaseable to all sectors of the Nigerian economy in order to enhance economic growth and development. © EuroJournals, Inc. 2009.",

"Tu Y., Lu M.",A conceptual framework for designing and building Web-based Revenue-sharing Collaboration Systems (WRCS) in supply chain management,2009,"Good collaboration plays an important role in effective supply chain management. The main obstacle to collaboration within a supply chain is the conflict between each enterprise's local optimisation and the chain's global optimisation. We show that with relationships, trust, contracts and other social factors, the sharing and reallocation of revenue can be used to align with the objectives of each member of the supply chain management, from local to global optimisation. We propose a Web-based Revenue-sharing Collaboration System (WRCS) that takes advantage of Information Technology (IT) in the digital economy. We outline the WRCS scheme, which includes four components: 1 measuring performance 2 monitoring performance and revenue reallocation 3 Global Optimisation Algorithm (GOA) 4 reconfiguration (planning, forecasting and recommendation). We identify the technology and system requirements for WRCS and illustrate the difference between Collaborative Planning, Forecasting and Replenishment (CPFR) systems and WRCS. The challenges, impediments and enablers for the implementation of the proposed collaboration system are also discussed.

Stevenson S.,Digital divide: A discursive move away from the real inequities,2009,"Within the context of the telecommunications policy environment in the United States during the 1990s, the Department of Commerce's Falling Through the Net reports can be read as a 7-year ideological project to legitimize U.S. government's deregulatory policies. This article analyzes the digital divide as rhetorical trope in a neoliberal ideology, which placed responsibility for social and economic success in the emerging global information economy at the level of the individual and not the system, effectively foreclosing on any class-based analyses of the problems associated with the transition from a Keynesian welfare state and industrial economy to a neoliberal and globalized information economy. Unpacking the discursive significance of the digital divide, with special focus on public libraries and projects of the Gates Foundation, illuminates how it foreclosed on the possibility of alternative problem definitions by making the problem a technical and administrative one rather than an issue of historic class struggle. The article draws on open-source projects in developing countries to offer an alternate frame for formulating policies for equitable access to information and communication technologies (ICTs).",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; Digital divide; Digital exclusion; Digital inclusion; Public access computing; Public libraries; Universal access; Universal service

"Papadopoulos T., Broadbent R.",Reducing the digital divide: An evaluation framework for the wired community@collingwood project,2009,"Presents an evaluation framework and methodology to examine the effectiveness of a digital inclusion initiative centered on the provision of broadband internet and computers to residents of a public housing estate. The provision of ICT infrastructure and establishment of a Social Enterprise are designed to reduce a number of impediments to digital participation by reducing social costs and economic costs (establishment costs, transaction costs and search and information costs). Access to ICT infrastructure in the digital age is arguably as important a ""merit good"" as education and health, in which genuine opportunity is fundamental to reducing economic and social disparity. Reducing the digital divide is not about infrastructure provision but rather supporting ICTenabled solutions to improve social and economic outcomes by empowering local communities. The evaluation framework encompasses several dimensions including; education and training; community and culture; support and development of citizenship and democracy; health and wellbeing; economic equity, opportunity and sustainability; and information and communication. There is increasing evidence that the lack of access to information and communication technology (ICT) or the 'digital divide' severely limits education, employment and economic prospects. An individual's ability to use and access computers and the internet is vital to schooling and education generally, to participate effectively in the economy, and in many cases, to access everyday services. Research demonstrates that people on low incomes, without tertiary education, living in rural/remote areas, of Indigenous heritage, with disabilities, with a language background other than English and aged over 55 can lack opportunities to access the internet.

However, some students did not spend enough time on the task and did not appear to gain as much from the learning experience. This impacted on the extent and quality of collaboration in some groups. It is suggested that a staged wiki assessment might overcome some of the perceived shortcomings reported by students.",Creative collaboration; Flexible learning; Knowledge management; Teaching and learning; Web 2.0; Wiki
Kamel S.,Building the African information society,2009,"Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has introduced many changes over the last decades causing a socio-economic evolution based on information acquisition and knowledge dissemination. It helped create an emerging global information-based society with innovative means of communication that can help in increasing competitiveness for individuals, organisations and societies. ICT has helped generate new forms and structures of business, social and economic entities that are no longer bound by geographic or time constraints, but instead depend mainly on being connected all the time. This article addresses the efforts taking place in Africa to minimise the digital gap and actively join the global information society. Many African nations have invested heavily in building their ICT infrastructure to help improve the readiness of their communities and this article provides an overview of some of the projects implemented to build the African information society while demonstrating some the lessons learned and experiences acquired.

"Hamed A., Ball D., Berger H., Cleary P.",Can E-Commerce measure globalization?,2009,"Globalisation has recently become one of the terms most frequently used in politics, sociology, culture, and especially in economy. The technological basis of the modern globalisation includes the latest accomplishments of the third technological revolution: telecommunication systems, the scientific revolution, new forms of transport, the Internet and E-Commerce, because all of these technical-technological factors have facilitated unhindered communication of knowledge, people, information and capital among the countries worldwide. The question to be asked is how can a country measure its involvement in globalisation. One way is by using E-Commerce drivers and barriers. There are many issues that could count as drivers and barriers to E-Commerce and Globalisation such as cost, payment systems and legislation. By examining the E-Commerce drivers and barriers of a country which will depend upon the level of technological involvement with E-Commerce and its effect on a particular economy could result in Globalisation readiness in the country. For digital classification the level of engagement could be measured by the level of Internet involvement in the economy could measure the level of engagement. This measurement could be used to indicate the extent of globalisation in a country's economy. Globalisation is a result of removing barriers and restrictions to international trade and adopting free economic policy, which are the same drivers for E-Commerce.",
Mallardi V.,Thawing in a frigid economy,2009,"Some significant market trends and predictions that can help print industry to improve their business, are discussed. Banking-insurance is emerged as the highest demanding sector for print because they are looking to reform, re-distribute, and reinvent. Commercial banking are looking for consolidation and providing new services, while community banks want to re-capture their market loss. Investment and Brokerage sector is expected to demand less print products because investment banks/syndication and securities are laying off their staff, offices, and branding due to global economic downturn. Publishing and non-newspapers sectors are expected to demand more print products because of transformation of professional and educational books into digital micro-publishing and digital distribution like Bibliovault and online course and content. Packaged foods are also expected to demand more print jobs for their feed folding carton, closure, thermoforming, wrap, and roll label products.",

The wine industry is one of those industries experiencing some difficulty, as it contends with the heterogeneous state laws regulating wine shipments: in some states, the practice is allowed, while in others, it is considered a felony. Additional complexities arise when one considers the issues of taxation, age verification and the great diversity of the wine industry. Thus, the online wine consumer faces a bevy of potential problems when attempting to purchase a specific wine, particularly the first-time online wine buyer. This research examines the factors affecting the wine industry as it attempts to gain a greater presence in the online market.

"Cardoso J., Voigt K., Winkler M.",Service engineering for the internet of services,2009,"The Internet and the Web have extended traditional business networks by allowing a Web of different digital resources to work together to create value for organizations. The most industrialized countries have entered a post-industrial era where their prosperity is largely created through a service economy. There is a clear transition from a manufacturing based economy to a service based economy. From the technological perspective, the development of Web-based infrastructures to support and deliver services in this new economy raises a number of challenges. From a business perspective, there is the need to understand how value is created through services. In this paper, we describe how we propose to address these two perspectives and realize the vision of the Internet of Services (IoS), where Web-based IT-supported service ecosystems form the base of service business value networks.

The framework synthesizes frameworks of nomadic information environments with those that have a specific focus on E-Government as an E-Transformation response to the digital divide. It recognizes that the key technological drivers that underlie the development of computing technology are mobility, digital convergence, and mass scale. Dubbed the NECE (Nomadic E-Government Co-Evolutionary) framework, the critical dimensions focus attention on the macro level of building of Flexible Infrastructures; the meso level building of Nomadic Networks and the micro level building of Confident Communities. The critical linkages at the various levels focus on having in place the social, human resources, digital and physical resources that are necessary for addressing social exclusion of EGovernment in developing countries. This recognizes that e-government is not only a technology solution, but also a social system that elevates the need for empowered individuals, communities and whole societies through the building of social, human, digital and physical resources.",Africa; E-government; Information infrastructures; NECE; Nomadic computing; WWW
Styhre A.,The cinematic mode of organizing: Media and the problem of attention in organization theory,2009,"In the first half of the nineteenth century, the concept of perception was reformulated and was gradually conceived of as a contingent and subjective capacity rather than what is impersonal and therefore essentially unproblematic. In this new perspective, the concept of attention also became a source of interest for both researchers and management writers. Theories of perception and attention are closely associated with the use of media. While media have always been used in organizing, more recent digital media are producing new forms of communication and control in organization. Following [Beller, J. (2006). The cinematic mode of production: Attention economy and the society of the spectacle. Duke Hanover: Dartmouth College Press.] idea of an emerging ""cinematic mode of production"" characterized by the reliance on digital media and the visual labour of spectators as a value-adding process, the implication for organization are examined in such a perceptual regime of accumulation. The paper concludes by calling for a more detailed analysis of how media are structuring organizations in the present regime. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The provider of the regulated input is a domestic firm, while the provider of the other input is a foreign firm. This describes the market structure for several digital information and communication services, where the regulated input is access while the non-regulated complementary input is content. We show that one-sided regulation may have negative welfare effects compared to a free market economy, unless the regulator has a first-mover advantage. In the latter case, regulation is welfare enhancing regardless of whether the foreign input provider uses linear or non-linear wholesale prices. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2008.",Complementarities; Regulation; Strategic trade policy
"Narayanasamy K., Velmurugan M.S.",ICT adoption and development by the SME sector in Malaysia,2009,"The aim of the current study is to measure the level of ICT adoption among SMEs' in Malaysia and the factors that influence SMEs' favorable attitude and barriers that hinder them from adopting ICT in their business. SME is the heart of any national development both from an economy point of view as well as employment. ICT enterprises need creativity and innovations of a fast nature which is possible with the small sector. ICT also enables one to become a global player even in their greenfield project. The questions that arise are: Given this situation, ""Why are SMEs slow in adopting this vital tool for progress?"" ""Why is the encouragement mediocre with no special focus into training and development and incentives created for them?"" ""Why have there not been any TNA studies of this emerging area till date, while many other countries have reviewed and updated this area of study and are poised to make major breakthroughs?"" ""Why are later entrants in this progressing much faster then Malaysia, who is actually targeting to become the knowledge leaders of the Asian region?"" Though many of the areas would remain unaddressed in our study a fairly good glimpse is expected to be available to the researchers in this regard. Nevertheless, a study of the status is felt interesting and useful for academicians, policy makers and the industries attempting this development. Questionnaire responses were collected from 50 SME units' ICT status enabled consideration of the diverse uses of digital technology that already existed to support individuals, businesses and organizations use of information and knowledge management approaches. Research found that, most of the managers and supervisors of SMEs are aware of the benefits of ICT but yet a large portion of SMEs did not adopt ICT till date. This research also figured out the factors of ICT adoption, ICT planning of adoption, benefits of ICT adoption and barriers of ICT adoption among SMEs. Suggestions on the steps towards ICT adoption among SME has been discussed in this research. Therefore the change to ICT usage by SME sector is expected to open up a wide zone of operations favorable to the SME sector and other stakeholders, with a better business chance to all especially the SMEs adopting this initiative.

"Blignaut S., Els C.",Towards a research framework for ICT use in developing contexts,2009,"The digital divide describes the gap among individuals, households, businesses and geographic areas on socio-economic level, as well as unequal opportunities to access information and communication technologies (ICTs). Castells holds the view that informationalism of shifting global networks creates a volatile and ruthless world. Those who do not contribute to the new world economies are discarded. Consequently, much of Africa is condemned to information black holes as Africa becomes the graveyard of failed ICT development programmes. However, by sharing expertise, worldwide university networks of science and technology can reverse the inequities of informationalism. We have a shared academic responsibility to explore feasible research frameworks on the use of ICT in developing contexts.

Hsu C.,Service science: Design for scaling and transformation,2009,"Service science is an emerging field, but many still consider it lacking in substance. This book aims to change the situation by addressing the following questions: What is the big story about service? What are the main research problems in service? What does “a connected world” mean? Does service require a different kind of design science? What will be the next waves of the Web? How to support universal value co-creation? How to unite Cyberspace wilt physical space? Is it feasible to connect information resources everywhere?To answer these questions, the book presents and substantiates a digital connections scaling (DCS) model, complete with a population-oriented design paradigm and a new class of microeconomic production functions to explain the paths of transformation into the future - one of the most original results today. Next, the book analyzes new business designs on the Web and characterizes a service-led revolution for the Knowledge Economy. Thirdly, it develops systems planning and design methods to help implement the DCS model at the level of Information and Database Systems, Business Strategy, and Digitization Engineering, thereby enhancing these fields. Finally, certain intriguing new applications, especially “smart highways” and information supply chains, are discussed. © 2009 by World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Bertacchini E.E.,"Coase, Pigou and the potato: Whither farmers' rights?",2008,"This paper explores the realization of farmers' rights in order to reward farming communities for their contribution in conserving and developing crop genetic resources. Current proposals to realize farmers' rights follow both Coasean and Pigouvian approaches, which try to solve the public good dilemma generated by traditional farmers in supplying agrobiodiversity. However, both the solutions not only may be difficult to realize but also provide just incomplete incentives to traditional farmers in enhancing in situ genetic diversity. In analogy with emerging open source models in the digital information economy, I contend that traditional farming systems, with the customary practices of seed saving and exchange, must be regarded as a common based peer organization for germplasm production and distribution. For this reason, new options for implementing farmers' rights should be devised in order to strengthen farmers' practices to use and exchange seeds within the traditional seed systems. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

"Yoon-Zi K., Lee K.",Sectoral innovation system and a technological Catch-Up: The case of the capital goods industry in Korea,2008,"This paper deals with the question of why making a catch-up is even more difficult in capital goods industries that are usually led by small or middle-sized companies. It relies upon the sectoral systems of innovation as a theoretical framework for analysis. From the findings, the paper has identified three sources of difficulties in the catch-up of the capital goods industry, particularly in machine tools. First, while small firms in the capital goods industry are usually specialized suppliers to big final goods assembly firms in the consumer goods industry or other industries, and thus the tacit knowledge accumulated from the interface between the producer and the customer firms is very important, a serious difficulty lies in the fact that local client firms are reluctant to use locally made capital goods due to their poor quality and low precision level. Second, while a successful catch-up first requires the ability to produce goods of better quality and lower prices than those produced by incumbent firms from advanced countries, a typical difficulty arises because incumbent foreign firms often react by charging predatory prices upon news of the local development of capital goods by latecomers. Third, if the catch-up firms overcome this barrier, then the next strategy used by incumbent firms is to charge latecomers with legal actions for patent violations. Despite these intrinsic difficulties, the Korean economy has achieved a very slow but gradual catch-up in the capital goods industry. The paper has attributed such achievement to several factors, including the strenuous efforts of the government, niche markets in general-purpose machine tools and emerging economies, and finally, the increasing introduction and adoption of information technology (IT) or digital technologies in machine tools. Furthermore, the three sources of barriers to catch-up imply that any latecomer firms that wish to record a successful catch-up should have these barriers in mind from the beginning of the road towards catch-up. We observe that a successful catch-up requires the ability to produce goods of better quality and lower prices than those produced by incumbent firms from advanced countries. After the initial success, they should also be well prepared against eventual or possible attacks by the incumbent firms in the forms of predatory pricing and intellectual property rights (IPR) charges. © 2008 Institute of East and West Studies, Yonsei University, Seoul.",Catch-up; Machine tools industry; Sectoral systems of innovation
Marković M.R.,Managing the organizational change and culture in the age of globalization,2008,"Great shifts-genuine and radical transformation-have been shaping the economy and business environment in recent decades. The world is going to be too tough and competitors too ingenious as companies are shaken loose from traditional ways of conducting business. Therefore, the old principles no longer work in the age of Globalization. Based on her research, Dr Radović Marković tried to make a profile of a successful organization which will be in the best way adopted to business environment in the new economy. Namely,in order to get a complete picture how the winning organization will look like in the future, the author concluded that the successful companies in the future will be the ones which are wise enough to harness the full potential of the entire organization in the rapidly changing business environment .It means that the winners will be the unbridled firms that are responsive to challenges and adroit in both creating opportunities and capturing them. In other words, to match the business environment that is more networked within and among companies, the ability to manufacture value will have to be distributed across the company to a much greater extent than in the past. Under these circumstances, managers need to transform themselves, too. They need to have a better framework for thinking about and understanding organizational change. Additionally, continuous learning is the key competency required by any organization that wants to survive and thrive in the newknowledge economy. Market champions keep asking learning questions, keep learning how to do things better, and keep spreading that knowledge throughout their organization. Knowledge organizations obtain competitive advantage from continuous learning, both individual and collective, concluded Dr.Radović Marković.The author also stresses that it is necessary to determine general personal knowledge and education, then to examine knowledge or various specializations in certain areas and lastly to identify their skills. Recent researches in the USA show that business owners who were not educated enough for the business in which they were engaged, were not successful (80 % of their businesses failed during the first year of their existence). On the opposite, those entrepreneurs who were educated and who showed constant interest in improving their activities have increased their business success by 60 % after the completion of the basic training programs for entrepreneurship and management. Therefore the author pointed out that more highly skilled workforce should be beneficial to organizations. Additionally, the human capital approach reflects the view that the market value of the firm increasingly depends on intangible rather than tangible resources. The three main components of human capital are described as a) early ability, b) qualifications and knowledge acquired through education and c) skills, competencies and expertise through on-and off-the-job training. This would suggest that individual capability is enhanced by greater qualifications and higher skill levels. If this can be assessed and used in good effect in the firm then better human capital should, ceteris paribus, enhance organizational performance. Better organizational performance should, in turn, translate into better national performance. Finally, the author concluded that we should further recognize that we are living in the globalization era, or the Global Age. From the viewpoint of a product life cycle, we are in the introductory phase of globalization because we are in the early stages of the digital revolution that is creating the technologies that are enabling real time relationships among dispersed individuals and organizations. To meet constantly changing conditions and demands, business has to transcend boundaries to get what it needs regardless of where it exists - geographically, organizationally and functionally.",Communication; Corporate culture; Entrepreneurial skills; Global management; Globalization; Knowledge management; Organization
"De Fontenay A.B., De Fontenay E.B., Pupillo L.M.",The economics of peer-to-peer,2008,"Peer-to-Peer networks boast three characteristics that make them unique. First, they are layered networks conceived and operating in a similar fashion to the Internet. Second, they are completely decentralized, making servers of individual computers at the Peer-to-Peer layer, and acting in the way an ISP acts at the Internet IP layer. Finally, Peer-to-Peer networks are made up of the resources that individual members make available when they use their Peer-to-Peer networks. 1 These networks, which were initially used by individuals to share and download content, including a significant amount of copyright material such as music, are now increasingly used for downloading games, videos, and software. 2 In this paper, we focus on the economics of Peer-to-Peer in terms of the impact that Peer-to-Peer innovation is having on the content sector, especially on copyrighted material, and on how the latter has in turn influenced Peer-to-Peer networks. Peer-to-Peer technology makes a server of endusers. In addition, while Peer-to-Peer network service providers may retain some control over their own networks, this control is effectively restricted to the Peer-to-Peer layer as a pure transport and file-sharing layer, and is independent of the content that is shared, at least in the post-Napster era. In this paper, we study Peer-to-Peer from the perspective of the ""commons.""3 Since Hardins study (1998) it is best to distinguish between ""managed"" and ""unmanaged"" commons. Currently, all Peer-to-Peer networks are ""unmanaged"" at file-sharing level, which means that the commercial links between individual members of existing Peer-to-Peer communities and the owners of the copyright material that is being shared have now completely disappeared. Furthermore, institutions that clarify the scope of fair use in everyday practice have not yet been created. At the same time, experimental economics suggests that this outcome does not automatically create a ""tragedy of the commons.""4 As the commercial success of new services such as iTunes shows, it is conceivable that many members of those new Peer-to-Peer commons may be willing to shift to commercial Peer-to-Peer networks that incorporate reasonable payments to artists, thus reflecting the expanded use of copyrighted material. The above is also suggested by the willingness of individual users to participate in voluntary programs such as SETI. However, these experimental results also suggest that the current practice may be becoming routine-like, i.e., that the window of opportunity for that kind of solution may shut in the near future, with consumers increasingly reluctant to diverge from the routines they are developing. The willingness of members of Peer-to-Peer communities to contribute with access and computer resources to the community is another commons Peer-to-Peer is creating. Todays Peer-to-Peer file sharing makes it simple for individuals and their downloaded Peer-to-Peer software to search for, share, and download files from other users on the same Peer-to-Peer system. While a few years have elapsed since court decisions in the USA essentially eliminated Peerto- Peer networks such as Napster and Aimster, many of the lessons that are relevant to a Peer-to-Peer economic analysis can still be traced back to those two cases. 5 In 2001, The Economist observed that, ""[t]he most important lesson of Napster is that people are willing to open their computers to, and share files with, complete strangers as long as they see value in doing so. In the process, they have shown how really large computer networks can be created rapidly through the piecemeal contribution of millions of individual PCs, each of which functions as a server as well as client"" (The Economist 2001).6 Over the years, the content sector has evolved into the industry we know today. It is, at present, a complex and, generally, highly concentrated sector that is characterized by a range of content types, the major elements of which are the video entertainment and music sectors as well as, increasingly, the gaming one. Through time, the sector has been characterized by the growing role of intermediation and the impact of technology on the ability to produce, access, copy and store content, as well as share and consume it. Technological innovation has revolutionized more than just the ability to access, transform, and consume content. It has redefined the very meaning of access, by copying and storing, sharing, and consuming. 7 Peer-to-Peer is a new enough activity the alternative object of which that can be associated with the sectors economic analysis needs to be clarified. With the gradual emergence of the Peer-to-Peer institutional setting, the economics of Peer-to-Peer are moving from the economic analysis of the transition process to the economic analysis of Peer-to-Peer as an established communication and processing architecture. At one end of the spectrum, we could consider the Peer-to-Peer sector in terms of conventional questions such as the demand for content and the role of free-riding. At the other end, economic analysis can help better understand the evolution of the institutional environment. It might help to understand the economic implications of competing frameworks within which Peer-to-Peer might operate. The kind of questions involved relate to subject matters such as the extent and meaning of copyrights ownership. The Napster court and Aimster cases as well as, more recently, the Ninth Circuit Courts Decision, are all elements of the trial and error process through which society is identifying the context within which Peer-to-Peer will largely be able to operate. What is the economics of Peer-to-Peer? Everything suggests that Peerto- Peers role is of growing significance for the content sector. There is no doubt that this is particularly true for video Peer-to-Peer. After all, this is the fastest growing segment of Peer-to-Peer, which is itself one of the fastest growing sectors in the digital economy. In addition, while the courts have been addressing Peer-to-Peer issues since the Napster Decision, the process is far from being complete: discussions on Peer-to-Peer economics in terms of a stable institutional setting are yet to take place. The specificity of Peer-to-Peer networks and their historical setting today raise questions about the applicability of many conventional economic tools. This has led us to select an analytical methodology that pays far more attention to the institutions that are developing with the growth of Peer-to-Peer, and to the economic forces that contribute to shape the same institutions. Conventional economic tools generally presume that stability and maturity are characteristics of the sectors that are under study. On the other hand, the process through which institutions take shape is a complex one involving not only economics but also a wide range of other factors. Nevertheless, it is important to evaluate the economic forces at play in this process, in order to understand the type of scenario that is likely to emerge and the changes it can bring about as new stakeholders compete to set up in the new environment. One of the main reasons why the understanding of the dynamics that shapes the transformation of the content sector into a mature Peer-to-Peer environment is so important, especially for those who believe in an optimal spontaneous order, is that the outcome is not predetermined as a unique ""optimal"" solution. In fact, our hope is that studies such as this one will help improve and streamline the process through which Peer-to-Peer could become established efficiently. Our analysis helps us focus on intermediation, the functionality that is most affected by Peer-to-Peer, in the emergence of stable and predictable Peer-to-Peer institutions. Indeed, through time, todays aggregators have built and now use intermediation to their advantage. Thus, aggregators have transformed their role from one of mere intermediation into one of ownership and brokerage. Such new functions have exacerbated the incumbency dimension of their position and, with it, the inherent tension that emerges between extracting more rents from existing assets, and developing new assets with new artists. © 2008 Springer-Verlag New York.",
"Zwick D., Dholakia N.",Infotransformation of Markets: Introduction to the special issue on marketing and information technology,2008,"Information and communication technologies (ICTs) are a driving force behind major economic, social, and cultural shifts from the modern to the postmodern, from local to global markets, from production to consumption, and from industrial to informational economies. While much has been written about the relationship between marketing and technology, most of the work regards marketing as an a priori category onto which new technologies are simply overlaid as they come along. These instrumentalist-functionalist views of ICTs in marketing are not particularly well suited when - as in macromarketing - the focus is on marketing systems and consumption systems. The present collection of articles provides one of the most insightful one-stop learning shops of the changing character of markets in the information age. From the fractal views of the ethical economy and its emergent collaborative production-provisioning-consumption system to the realities of the persistent digital divide in the age of the mobile phone, articles in this issue touch on important elements of marketing in the age of information.

"Fisher-Vanden K., Sue Wing I.",Accounting for quality: Issues with modeling the impact of R&D on economic growth and carbon emissions in developing economies,2008,"The literature on climate policy modeling has paid scant attention to the important role that R&D is already playing in industrializing countries such as China, where R&D investments are targeting not only productivity improvements but also enhancements in the quality and variety of products. We focus here on the effects of quality-enhancing innovation on energy use and GHG emissions in developing countries. We construct an analytical model to show that efficiency-improving and quality-enhancing R&D have opposing influences on energy and emission intensities, with the efficiency-improving R&D having an attenuating effect and quality-enhancing R&D having an amplifying effect. We find that the balance of these opposing forces depends on the elasticity of upstream output with respect to efficiency-improving R&D, the elasticity of downstream output with respect to upstream quality-enhancing R&D occurring upstream, and the relative shares of emissions-intensive inputs in the costs of production of upstream versus downstream industries. We employ a computable general equilibrium (CGE) simulation of the Chinese economy to illustrate the difficulties that arise in incorporating these results into models for climate policy analysis, and we offer a simple remedy. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

This paper draws on original empirical research at Fulchester International Airport and studies the movement of various subjects and objects (including passengers, bags and aeroplanes) as they are assembled and disassembled by 'modes of ordering' to facilitate the flows of exchange and interaction that for Castells binds the physically disjointed positions of social actors in contemporary global organization. Our study explores the ways in which digital information and communications technology creates 'spectral' and uncanny phenomena that feeds back into the here-and-now of mundane, organizational reality. We find that an emergent hybridity between the dimensions of the virtual and the real opens up an intensive space that seems to extend the becoming of a 'post-human' ontology; but in so doing it also provokes the return of a recalcitrant and unpredictable mass. © 2008 SAGE Publications.",Airports; Digital reserve; Flow; Flux; Modes of ordering; Space
"Preston P., Cawley A.",Broadband development in the European Union to 2012-A virtuous circle scenario,2008,"Along with many national governments, the European Commission has pushed broadband to the fore of social and economic policies in recent years. It has aligned broadband developments with furthering information society and knowledge economy developments. This paper presents a positive scenario for broadband-related developments in the European Union area from 2009 to 2012. The scenario, the iNetWorked Society, is one of four developed in an extensive multi-country project funded by the European Commission under the 6th Framework Programme. Before examining the scenario, however, the paper places into a critical perspective the EU's legacy of broadband policy to date. It highlights the limitations of technology-centred policy frames and broadband strategies, which privilege supply-side infrastructure and neglect demand-side issues of applications, uses and users. Such policy frames have been associated with great variations in the level of broadband rollout, take-up and use across Member States. The paper then outlines the socio- and macro-economic conditions that need to be in place in Europe for the positive scenario of the iNetworked Society to be realised. The iNetWorked Society comprises a plausible, internally consistent scenario for developments in a number of broadband-related areas: broadband adoption, e-business, e-work, e-government and digital content. It is based on a virtuous circle of technological, economic and socio-political developments, including strong economic growth, high broadband penetration, and high social engagement with ICTs. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

"Sharma R.S., Ng E.W.J., Dharmawirya M., Lee C.K.",Beyond the digital divide: A conceptual framework for analyzing knowledge societies,2008,"Purpose - The research reported in this ongoing study aims to investigate the notion of knowledge assets developed within digital communities in the course of their economic or leisure activities. Ideally, the resulting knowledge is universal, affordable and relevant; this inclusiveness is a hallmark of any information or knowledge society. Design/methodology/approach - The authors first synthesize the related research literature covering the areas of knowledge-based economies, knowledge societies and knowledge policies. A model using 13 dimensions is then developed, which the authors claim is critical for creating a knowledge community in the digital economy. The model is validated against critique from a Delphi panel of researchers in the area. Findings - While creating a knowledge society encompasses dimensions pertaining to infrastructure, governance, talent and culture, intangible assets are key to sustaining such societies. Governance and culture are instances of such intangibles. Talent may seem to be tangible but the human capacity for learning and development, which leads to an innovative culture, is less so. In any case, time is the essential ingredient for a knowledge culture to come about. Research limitations/implications - Knowledge societies are not measurable constructs that can be described quantitatively and benchmarked with weighted summations of scores along prescribed dimensions. It would be a fallacy to treat the notion of a knowledge index as a socio-economic measure of success. Practical implications - Conclude with a practical view of how the dimensions may be best exploited in the course of a policy discussion on sustainable knowledge societies. Originality/value - It is hoped that the research will provide a framework for policy makers and analysts to conduct qualitative discussions on creating and sustaining knowledge societies.",Intellectual capital; Knowledge economy; Knowledge management; Sustainable development
Charoensiriwath C.,Strategic cluster management for technological capability building: A case of hard disk drive cluster in Thailand,2008,"Several countries now have national programs to support cluster-based innovation in their key industries. They all realize that geographical clusters are significant drivers of innovations and competitiveness in today's fast-moving global economy. Cluster are formally planned and created with concentration of targeted industry and support infrastructure such as university researchers, supporting government agencies, vocational training providers, financial institutions, etc., This study follows the development of the hard disk drive (HDD) industry in Thailand. Over the past twenty years, the hard disk drive (HDD) industry in Thailand has grown steadily. The inflows of foreign investment in HDD-related manufacturing to Thailand have made the country the world largest exporter of hard disk drives and components in the past year. The Big 4 companies (Seagate Technology, Hitachi Global Storage Technology (HGST), Fujitsu and Western Digital) all have production bases in Thailand. With their presences, most of their suppliers have decided to have production bases or representatives in Thailand as well. This makes Thailand to have an almost complete supply chain of the HDD industry. This study analyzes the strategy employed by the Thai government to build national technological capability in hard disk drive technology through strategic cluster management. The government has established the Hard Disk Drive Institute (HDDI) as a center to develop infrastructure for research capability for the industry. This case study highlights the government roles and its strategy to formally build national technological capability on specific industry. © 2008 PICMET.",

The needs of the global economy have encouraged the furniture industry sector to use secure electronic commerce services. However, typically each of these companies uses different software to design, produce and sell their final product. A more competitive method of exchanging product data with higher quality and with low cost is foreseen, has been proposed inside IMS SMART-fm project (www.ims.org, www.smart-fm.funstep.org), leading to the need for adoption of data standards. Involving partners from USA, Europe, Canada and Australia, this project develops and demonstrates in industrial environments, an interoperable open standards-based framework that supports smart environments through the complete product life cycle in the furniture manufacturing industry. This framework supports a two level approach to business-to-business electronic commerce: 1) interoperability among user applications, and 2) interoperability among electronic commerce platforms. The paper presents the strategic objectives and results as a case study to stimulate and accelerate enterprises to adopt technologies and practices in the emerging networked digital economy. It concludes anticipating the strategic results that it will deliver for the next decade. © 2008 PICMET.",
"Scheel C., Parada J.",Leveraging competitiveness and economic growth through linking innovation systems to wealth creation in emerging countries,2008,"Most industrialized countries have been able to insert innovation into their national agendas, leveraging competitiveness, economic growth and social development. Well structured national innovation systems run across all the innovation value chain: from the transfer of ideas or inventions, to their commercialization as high value and differentiated products or services, producing high economic and social impacts In developing countries, the circumstances are quite different. There are weak liaisons, low trust and poor association between economic generators (companies) and their supporting institutions (government, federations, banks and academies). Regions are not electronically prepared (e-readiness) to support the infrastructure required for the effective formation of clusters (c-readiness). Innovation is not perceived as an asset, and high value entrepreneurship is not a common finding in the entrepreneurial profiles of most professionals. There are no world class industrial enabling conditions, nor high value core capabilities, and the digital economies are creating large digital development divides instead of business opportunities. In general, the economic gap between rich countries and poor ones widens every day. To help alleviate this situation, we have developed the WIT Model (Wealth creation through Innovation and enabling Technologies). This model has been designed to create the necessary and sufficient enabling conditions and core capabilities to empower developing regions to transform their scarce resources and hostile conditions, into attractive regions with competitive industries and innovative companies, capable of producing great added and differential values, strongly interrelated with their regional social capital, so that they can compete globally as extended networks of value, and share their economic value among their local communities. Several cases of application of the model are shown, specially the current project of the Institute for Innovation and Technology Transfer (IITT) planned to position the city of Monterrey, Mexico, as an international Pole of Innovation and Competitiveness. © 2008 PICMET.",
"Rohrbeck R., Steinhoff F., Perder F.",Virtual customer integration in the innovation process: Evaluation of the web platforms of multinational enterprises (MNE),2008,"Integrating the customer in the innovation process is believed to be a powerful means to reduce failure rates and to increase the revenue from new products. Although many companies have launched programs to enable such integration, the understanding of the mechanisms behind successful programs remains limited. Furthermore, the benefit of integrating customers in the innovation process has to be weighed against the costs. Virtual customer integration has been discussed as a way to limit these costs and bring the benefits of potentially unlimited scalability. Using a sample of the Euro Stoxx 50 companies, we shed light on the various types of virtual customer integration platforms, their limitations, their benefits and the mechanisms that have to be put in place to make them succeed. Results indicate that only a limited number of platforms go beyond the sourcing of ideas. Especially the integration of the customer in the execution phase of the innovation process remains largely limited to digital goods. © 2008 PICMET.",

ICTs benefits however usually supersede its negatives, hence business owners both large and small are moving to the digital world. Although there has been studies on ICTs effect on business organizations, little has been done on the Small and Medium Enterprises (SME), in developing countries. The research was conducted to identify how SMEs in the Western Cape of South Africa use ICT. Issues examined included currently employed ICT, person to computer ratios, spending and acquisition of ICT, and adoption of new ICT. The research found that SMEs in the Western Cape are using a wide range of ICT, with 88% using networks, and 70% using some form of customer relationship management software. The person to computer ratio was computed and 78% of SMEs in the Western Cape showed a 1:1 (Person: Computer) ratio. Spending habits with regards to three ICT sectors (hardware, software and services) were analysed and although majority of SMEs showed no adjustment in their spending habits, 30% did claim an increase is expected for both software and hardware spending. SMEs are intending to adopt more ICT in the future. The majority of SMEs claim to have achieved significant amounts of value from the use of ICT. © 2008 PICMET.",

This book examines major problems in the current IPR regime, particularly the copyright regime, in the context of digitization, knowledge economy, and globalization. The book contends that the final goals of IP law and policy-making are to enhance the progress of science and economic development, and the use and even-distribution of intellectual resource at the global level. By referring to major international IP consensus, recent developments in regional IP forums and the successful experiences of various countries, YiJun Tian is able to provide specific theoretical, policy and legislative suggestions for addressing current copyright challenges. The book contends that each nation should strengthen the coordination of its IP protection and development strategies, adopt a more systematic and heterogeneous approach, and make IP theory, policy, specific legal mechanisms, marketing forces and all other available measures work collectively to deal with digital challenges and in a way that contributes to the establishment of a knowledge equilibrium international society. © 2009 YiJun Tian.

"Nyffenegger F., Bacs C.",Integration of new technologies for internet-based collaboration in engineering,2008,"Purpose - In today's globalized economy, distributed collaboration in engineering is important. Participants of engineering teams, with their specific knowledge situated in different locations, must be able to work together as efficiently and as comfortably as possible to provide an optimum contribution to product development. This paper aims to improve the effectiveness of internet based communication. Design/methodology/approach - Analysis of the current situation was carried out from different perspectives. First, an in-depth state-of-the-art study of existing hardware and software concepts was done. Second, these tools were evaluated by collaboration experiments. Finally, a concept for improved internet collaboration was elaborated and implemented. Findings - The main technical method used in this concept is a data overlay which allows different interactive information levels to be mapped on top of a video stream. In addition, eye-to-eye video conferencing hardware and a perceptive user interactions system are combined in an integrated system. Practical implications - An application framework was developed, which integrates the different technologies. Using this framework, three application scenarios were implemented and tested. One focusing on brainstorming using the metaplan-technique, second is used to build function-structures and the third allows engineers to plan a plant on 2D, while it is shown in 3D.

Mutula S.M.,Comparison of sub-Saharan Africa's e-government status with developed and transitional nations,2008,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to compare the e-government status of sub-Saharan African countries with developed and transitional countries. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on an analysis of eRepublic.org web directory and desk research. Besides, analyses of global e-government, digital opportunity and information society indices are used. Findings - Wide disparities in e-government exist within regional trading blocs in sub-Saharan Africa with Southern Africa far ahead of east and west Africa regions. Compared with other continents, sub-Saharan Africa lags far behind Europe, North America and Asia in e-government. Several barriers including infrastructure, policy, legal and skill factors are identified as limiting the opportunity for sub-Saharan Africa to move government services online. Research limitations/implications - Providing an accurate comparative picture of e-government of sub-Saharan Africa with developed and transitional economies is difficult because most e-government studies hardly cover Africa. Besides, there is a general lack of reliable data about e-government status in Africa as most government web sites are undeveloped. Practical implications - Africa must invest more in infrastructure and enhance a legislative and policy framework to effectively compete with developed and transitional nations not only in e-government, but also in international economy. Originality/value - e-Government comparative assessment of sub-Saharan Africa with developed and transitional economies is based on several indices, thus providing a more informative picture of e-government status in Africa. Africa can learn from the experiences and best practices of developed and transitional countries in e-government development.",Communication technologies; Government; Sub-Saharan Africa
Kiesling L.L.,Deregulation innovation and market liberalization: Electricity regulation in a continually evolving environment,2008,"Over the past 50 years the US economy has experienced economic dynamism and technological change at a dizzying pace, driven substantially by innovation in digital communication technology. This dynamism has had limited effects in the electricity industry, and institutional change within the industry to adapt to these changes has been variable. Many states in the U.S. do not participate in open wholesale markets, and even more states have either no retail markets or have implemented such a restricted and politicized version of retail markets that potential retail market entrants still face substantial entry barriers. This book explores institutional design and regulatory policies in the US electricity industry that can adapt to unknown and changing conditions produced by economic, social, and technological change. Whereas the dominant regulatory paradigm has traditionally been centralized economic and physical control based on natural monopoly theory and power systems engineering, the ideas presented and synthesized by Kiesling compose a different paradigm - decentralized economic and physical coordination through contracts, transactions, price signals, and integrated intertemporal wholesale and retail markets. Digital communication technology, and its increasing pervasiveness and affordability, make this decentralized coordination possible. Kiesling argues that with decentralized coordination, distributed agents themselves control part of the system, and in aggregate their actions produce order. Technology makes this order feasible, but the institutions, the rules governing the interaction of agents in the system, contribute substantially to whether or not order can emerge from this decentralized coordination process. © 2009 L.

"Loch K.D., Straub D.W., Kamel S.",Diffusing the internet in the Arab world: The role of social norms and technological culturation,2008,"Drawing on the theoretical work of Hill et al. and Straub et al., this study examines culture-specific inducements and impediments to using the Internet in the Arab world. Research questions were (1) to what extent does the process of technology culturation affect the acceptance of the Internet (2) to what extent do social norms (SNs) affect the acceptance of the Internet? Of the two research methods employed, the first was a quantitative field study of knowledge workers. The instrument measured the extent to which respondents and their organizations are influenced by advanced technology cultures. Using partial least squares (PLS), the first of two models tested links between SNs; technological culturation and Internet usage for each respondent. The second model investigated links between technological culturation and Internet utilization for the respondent's organization. Findings show strong support for both models, explaining, respectively, 47% and 37% of the variance. The second method was a qualitative analysis of respondents ' free-format comments. These findings reinforce the quantitative findings, on the one hand, and reveal additional cultural barriers that still need to be studied, on the other. Findings identify how culture can both inhibit and encourage technological innovation and how Arab cultures can move their economies more quickly into the digital age. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

"Lee S.-M., Ungson G.R.",Towards a theory of synchronous technological assimilation: The case of Korea's Internet economy,2008,"While traditional theories of economic development and the dynamics of late industrialization explain Korea's phenomenal transformation into a major industrial power in only three decades, they fall short of explaining the timing of its ascent to the world's top technological hub, measured in terms of universal broadband installation and Internet usage, i.e., its leadership position in the Internet-centric economy. Moreover, Korea's socio-cultural factors, acknowledged to have enhanced learning and individual motivation as an integral part of Korea's economic transformation, are not sufficient by themselves in explaining Korea's ability to leapfrog over their American, Japanese, and European counterparts. In a departure from stage-of-growth and late industrialization theories, we introduce three synchronous conditions to account for Korea's leapfrogging dynamics: (1) the application of new technologies, (2) the emerging new pattern of individual consumption, and (3) a supporting logic of enterprise that links these two conditions. In adapting these conditions to the case of Korea, we argue that the first two can apply to any generic technological environment, but that the logic of enterprise is inextricably linked to unique Korean cultural values and institutions. In doing so, we hope to unpack the linkage between technological learning, advancement, and national culture. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Adebanjo D.,Intermediation in downstream automotive supply chains - A review of the role of internet technology,2008,"Increasing competitiveness of the automotive industry has resulted in fundamental changes to the industry. Significant consolidation has aimed at improving organisational positioning to take advantage of economies of scale and greater upstream supply chain coordination. Significant success has been achieved with upstream activities but less success has been achieved with downstream activities. The application of communications technology to downstream activities has not been as significant as that of other sectors (e.g., electronics and food industries). This study aims to understand the challenges faced with regards to communication between OEMs, automobile dealers and consumers. It is based on three case studies focusing on different aspects of operation - lead management, car finance and reverse logistics. The study found that internet technologies play a significant part in improving efficiency and information visibility in downstream operations. It also suggested that the operational 'weak link' in the supply chain can be addressed through technological investment and relationship development between OEMs and automobile dealers.

It deconstructs popular myths about a sustainable information society. One myth is that telework has reduced the need to travel and hence environmental pollution. The reality is that teleworkers make up only a small share of the total workforce, telework can generate new social relationships and hence the need for more travelling, work-related travel produces only a small amount of the total carbon dioxide emissions, and that the total distance travelled per employee is constantly rising. Another myth is that information economy is weightless and dematerialized which reduces environmental impacts. The energy and resource intensities of the ICT sector are indeed lower than the one of the total economy. The ICT sector also emits less CO2 than the total economy. But the ICT sector constitutes only a small portion of the total value added and fossil fuel combustion is still the dominant activity of modern industrial economies. Some stakeholders argue that virtual products allow resource, energy, and transport savings. But burning digital music on compact discs and DVDs, printing digital articles and books, etc. results in rebound effects that cause new material and energy impacts, computers have a low life span of 2-3 years, reusable and upgradeable computers and computer equipment are hardly used and might not be as profitable as non-reusable ones, computers are consuming much energy. Alternatives such as energy consumption labels on ICTs and green ICTs that consume less energy contradict dominant economic interests. A sustainable information society is a society that makes use of ICTs and knowledge for fostering a good life for all human beings of current and future generations by strengthening biological diversity, technological usability, economic wealth for all, political participation of all, and cultural wisdom. Achieving a sustainable information society costs, it demands a conscious reduction of profits by not investing in the future of capital, but the future of humans, society, and nature. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Ecology; ICTs; Nature; Sustainability; Sustainable information society; Technology
Olleros X.,The lean core in digital platforms,2008,"This paper intends to illustrate and make more explicit the decentralization argument put forward in the literature on platform leadership. The analysis shows that in the digital economy, where rapid scalability and evolvability are so important, decentralization has played a crucial role in the success of some open platforms, as against the failure of other, also open but more centralized, platforms. More specifically, on the basis of four comparative case studies, the paper shows that platform leaders should beware of offering the market too heavy a platform core, lest the platform's neutrality, scalability and evolvability be compromised. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Harwit E.,China's Telecommunications Revolution,2008,"China's telecommunications industry has seen revolutionary transformation and growth over the past three decades. Chinese Internet users number more than 150 million, and the PRC expects to quickly pass the US in total numbers of connected citizens. The number of mobile and fixed-line telephone users soared from a mere 2 million in 1980 to a total of more than 800 million in 2007 - the country took the number one rank in the world in the number of telephones. China has been the most successful developing nation in history for spreading telecommunications access at an unparalleled rapid pace. This book tells how China conducted its remarkable 'telecommunications revolution'. It examines both corporate and government policy to get citizens connected to both voice and data networks. It looks at the potential challenges to the one-party government when citizens get this access. And it considers the new opportunities for networking now offered the people of one of the world's fastest growing economies. The book is based on the author's fieldwork conducted in several Chinese cities, as well as extensive archival research. It focuses on key issues such as building and running the country's Internet, mobile phone company rivalry, foreign investment in the sector, and telecommunications in China's vibrant city of Shanghai. It also considers the country's internal 'digital divide', and questions how equitable the telecommunications revolution has been. Finally, it examines the ways the PRC's entry to the World Trade Organization will shape the future course of telecommunications growth. © Eric Harwit 2008.

"Kauffman R.J., Wang B.",Tuning into the digital channel: Evaluating business model characteristics for Internet firm survival,2008,"More than 5,000 Internet firms have failed since the beginning of 2000. One common perception is that the downturn in the economy drove many firms out of business. But then, why have some firms survived? In this research, we provide an empirical analysis by examining how the business model characteristics of an Internet firm affect its survival. We analyze a panel data set of 130 public Internet firms using two different techniques: non-parametric survival analysis, and the semiparametric Cox proportional hazards model. We characterize the survival rates throughout the lifetimes of the public Internet firms in our sample. Our results reveal that smaller firms that facilitate customer-provider interactions, are transaction brokers, and that rely on advertising as their primary source of revenue sources have had a lower likelihood of bankruptcy or failure. In addition, the detrimental effects on failing to serve as interaction platforms for individuals and businesses, and a larger firm size diminish over time as Internet firms mature, and the weaker ones are forced out of the marketplace. Our research also points out important dimensions of an Internet firm's business model that affect its survival. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2008.",Business models; Competitive strategy; Duration analysis; Empirical methods; Internet firms; Strategic management; Survival analysis
"Hsieh J.J.P.-A., Rai A., Keil M.",Understanding digital inequality: Comparing continued use behavioral models of the socio-economically advantaged and disadvantaged,2008,"Digital inequality is one of the most critical issues in the knowledge economy. The private and public sectors have devoted tremendous resources to address such inequality, yet the results are inconclusive. Theoretically grounded empirical research is needed both to expand our understanding of digital inequality and to inform effective policy making and intervention. The context of our investigation is a city government project, known as the LaGrange Internet TV initiative, which allowed all city residents to access the Internet via their cable televisions at no additional cost. We examine the residents' post-implementation continued use intentions through a decomposed theory of planned behavior perspective, which is elaborated to include personal network exposure. Differences in the behavioral models between socio-economically advantaged and disadvantaged users who have direct usage experience are theorized and empirically tested. The results reveal distinct behavioral models and isolate the key factors that differentially impact the two groups. The advantaged group has a higher tendency to respond to personal network exposure. Enjoyment and confidence in using information and communication technologies, availability, and perceived behavioral control are more powerful in shaping continued ICT use intention for the disadvantaged. Implications for research and practice are discussed.",Digital divide; Digital inequality; IT policy; Socio-economic inequality; Technology acceptance

"Wijnhoven F., Kraaijenbrink J.",Product-oriented design theory for digital information services: A literature review,2008,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to give a structured literature review, design concepts, and research propositions related to a product-oriented design theory for information services. Information services facilitate the exchange of information goods with or without transforming these goods. Exemplar information services are e-publishing, electronic communities-of-practice, and management reporting. The importance of information services in the current economy merits the development of an explicit product- and process-oriented design theory. Design/methodology/approach - This article focuses on the product-oriented design theory by applying Walls et al.'s framework. A product-oriented design theory of information services identifies relevant descriptive and explanatory insights (i.e. content, use, value, and revenue), meta-requirements, and meta-designs. The paper describes design problems for information services, and gives key requirements for information services. Next, it describes the information, organizational and information technological components of an information service, and identifies at least four information service architectures. Finally, it gives research hypotheses, research ideas, and discusses practical implications. Findings - The results form a product-oriented design theory for information services. The paper gives a structured way for practitioners to analyze information service design challenges, and suggestions are given for requirements and design decisions on three aspects (content, use feature, and revenue). Originality/value - Given the previously fragmented nature of the literature, this paper gives new opportunities for research and practice. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Electronic publishing; Information services; Internet

However, few of them understand the challenges they will have to face in the following 10 or 15 years. In our opinion, the modernism of the 21st century essentially implies three key items: technology, organization and quality. From this perspective, modern organization has to combine its resources in an efficient way to achieve its own goals. One of the declared goals of a modern organization is to inform users correctly and in due time users by organizing a high quality information system based on modern technologies. Therefore, accounting, as part of the information system, through the information supplied explains why their total quality is a challenge for any modern organization.

Skordili S.,Regional inequalities and the digital economy challenge: Variations in internet accessibility across Greek regions,2008,"A large number of studies dealing with the evolution of regional inequalities in Greece persist in making use of improper and outdated indicators, such as the number of telephone lines per capita or electricity consumption per capita. These indicators were appropriate to describe regional inequalities during the previous decades. However, nowadays, they present insignificant regional variations. Among technology-related indicators, the spatial diffusion of the Internet is a useful sign of growth potential and technological capacity. There is no doubt that the Internet can strongly influence individuals, places, societies and economies, and these effects are likely to grow during the foreseeable future. This chapter aims to investigate and map the differences in internet diffusion across Greek urban centres and regions. Primary data show that there is a notable imbalance in the spatial diffusion of internet use across the country. However, the approach is only broad-brush and should be viewed as exploratory. The poor quality of available data and the paucity of earlier research does not allow for the formulation of a more detailed analysis.",Internet penetration; Regional inequalities; Technology-related indicators

Rowley J.,Understanding digital content marketing,2008,"This article argues that as the importance of digital content to business and society grows it is important seek a holistic perspective on the definition and nature of digital content marketing (DCM). Along the journey it becomes evident that a recurrent theme in DCM is customer value, and this leads into the second major contribution of the article, an exploration of the notion of customer value in digital content marketplaces. Digital content is defined as: 'bit-based objects distributed through electronic channels'. A structured analysis is conducted on the basis of a set of questions in order to surface some of the unique characteristics of digital content marketing. The analysis is informed by a literature review, and the exploration of numerous web sites which deliver different types of digital content. The conclusion summarises the unique characteristics of digital content, and associated consequences for digital content marketing. It focuses on the impact of the difficulty in developing a notion of 'value' in the context of digital content, and its consequences for value chain structures, pricing strategies, marketing communications and branding, and licensing and digital rights management. In addition, the customer's experience of digital content is influenced by all stakeholders in the value chain as well as requiring the customer to participate in learning and co-creation of the experience. The potential of the 'value-in-use' notion of customer value as a basis for ensuring that consumers are fully engaged as stakeholders in the content economy is discussed. On this basis recommendations for practice and further research are developed. © Westburn Publishers Ltd.",Digital content marketing; Internet marketing

Christofor J.,Antecedents of venture firms' internationalization: A conjoint analysis of international entrepreneurship in the net economy,2008,"With the continuing dispersion of the global digital network and performance improvements of information and communication technologies, resource-poor start-ups with online business models have emerged in large numbers. These firms are able to deploy their competitive advantages across their country borders early in their life-cycle and engage in international commerce at a fast pace. An increased immediacy between the firms and the globally accessible customer is observed. Julia Christofor's study aims to analyze the conditions of the initial internationalization decision in the Net Economy. Based on Information Systems, International Entrepreneurship, and Entrepreneurship literature, factors, which constitute the internationalization propensity, are derived. The results of this study suggest that a holistic perspective including the founder, business model and the firm level should be considered when explaining the internationalization propensity of entrepreneurs. Julia Christofor's analysis also shows that depending on the decision-maker's entrepreneurial orientation, the internationalization propensity varies.

It turns finally to the public sector, examining how computers have fundamentally changed the nature of work in government and education. This book goes far beyond generalizations about the Information Age to the specifics of how industries have functioned, now function, and will function in the years to come. The book provides a broad overview of computing's and telecommunications' role in the entire public sector, including federal, state, and local governments, and in K-12 and higher education. Beginning in 1950, when commercial applications of digital technology began to appear, the book examines the unique ways different public sector industries adopted new technologies, showcasing the manner in which their innovative applications influenced other industries, as well as the US economy as a whole. The book builds on the surveys presented in the first volume, which examined sixteen manufacturing, process, transportation, wholesale and retail industries, and the second volume, which examined over a dozen financial, telecommunications, media, and entertainment industries.

Based on empirical analyses, the complexities of the relationship between construction activity and stage of economic development in Hong Kong were examined. With time series data, Granger causality test results show that the construction output particularly the infrastructure sector drives the economic growth of Hong Kong, and not vice versa. Findings further indicate that the role of the local construction industry changes as the economy matures from newly industrializing country (NIC) to advanced industrialized country (AIC) status, as revealed by the diminishing rate of capacity addition by construction as well as the growing maintenance and repair sector. This complies with Bon's inverted U-shaped relationship between construction activity and gross domestic product (GDP). However, the proposition of 'volume follows share' is not supported since the indigenous construction investments still sustain for the service-oriented economy which inevitably needs commercial development and logistics infrastructure to provide the services. The results may be significant for policy makers in NICs, in the long run, to formulate corporate and industrial policies to chart out a viable and sustainable course to revive the vigour of the industry.",Bon curve; Construction industry; Economic development; Hong Kong; Investments

"Yang C.C., Wei C.-P., Li K.W.",Cross-lingual thesaurus for multilingual knowledge management,2008,"The Web is a universal repository of human knowledge and culture which has allowed unprecedented sharing of ideas and information in a scale never seen before. It can also be considered as a universal digital library interconnecting digital libraries in multiple domains and languages. Beside the advance of information technology, the global economy has also accelerated the development of inter-organizational information systems. Managing knowledge obtained in multilingual information systems from multiple geographical regions is an essential component in the contemporary inter-organization information systems. An organization cannot claim itself to be a global organization unless it is capable to overcome the cultural and language barriers in their knowledge management. Cross-lingual semantic interoperability is a challenge in multilingual knowledge management systems. Dictionary is a tool that is widely utilized in commercial systems to cross the language barrier. However, terms available in dictionary are always limited. As language is evolving, there are new words being created from time to time. For examples, there are new technical terms and name entities such as RFID and Baidu. To solve the problem of cross-lingual semantic interoperability, an associative constraint network approach is investigated to construct an automatic cross-lingual thesaurus. In this work, we have investigated the backmarking algorithm and the forward evaluation algorithm to resolve the constraint satisfaction problem represented by the associative constraint network. Experiments have been conducted and show that the forward evaluation algorithm outperforms the backmarking one in terms of precision and recall but the backmarking algorithm is more efficient than the forward evaluation algorithm. We have also benchmarked with our earlier technique, Hopfield network, and showed that the associate constraint network (either backmarking or forward evaluation) outperforms in precision, recall, and efficiency. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The Digital Economy offers an up-to-date, critical synthesis that links the various aspects of the digital or cyber economy from the perspective of real firms. A geographic approach emphasizes how IT has made businesses less dependent on locational constraints, and the tangible effects on places and regions are placed at the core of the analysis. Case studies of companies, including Amazon, Dell, Li & Fung, and Volvo, demonstrate that the geography of digitally-driven production is the outcome of both dispersion and agglomeration dynamics. Global corporations are shown to have footprints that ignore - to some degree - distance and time, yet creative and coordinating activities remain anchored in urban innovative ecosystems such as Silicon Valley and Bangalore. These trends have been made possible by the development of a worldwide and integrated telecommunications network, whose unequal presence dictates the capabilities of places and communities to be connected to the global economy. However, the threat of the digital divide must not be overstated. In cities, rural areas, and emerging countries, local development is wrapped up in human capital, rather than technology.

The income distribution divides the population in two big sectors: one characterized by extreme poverty,as a proof of its dimensions, 40 million poor people constitutes the biggest challenge tointegrate Mexican population in the digital era. Our approach is to explore difficulties and exhibit one mechanism of how to integrate part of these underprivileged citizens in actual and future e-government actions, taking in account their needs, participation and culture. In the scope of reversing the digital divide the e-government's service delivery channels have been multiplied in last years, we briefly discus the principal issues of the e-Mexico program. Due to poverty trap affordability and benefits of the e-government actions are still not evident for most part of the citizen, in this sense e-government policies are unfair vis-à-vis of most part of population. Analyzing marginality and the Mexican demography we present, by means of a simple simulation model, a projection to the year 2050 of how could Mexican government be able to progressively stop the digital breach, the model shows that acting in the primary scholar sector we could reverse the digital division by simply extending the new e-government programs which have shown effectiveness in their first steps, like the Enciclomedia program, educational digital effort addressed to children during their basic instruction.

The presented evaluation is mined from the literatures and from our own experience in e-business strategies. The paper provides a theoretical survey for exploring the common ground between factors that create such a value. The introduced survey covers perspectives, definition, sources and drivers of e-business value creation.",E-business; E-business model; E-business value; Value appropriation; Value chain; Value creation; Value sources/drivers
"Kuropka D., Weske M.",Software development dynamics: Current trends and future developments,2007,"In a digital networked economy companies rely increasingly on software systems to collaborate with partner companies, to provide services to their customers and overall to achieve their business goals. While this trend has been around for years, it continues to have implications on the way software systems are designed and developed, as well as on the business models companies are based on. On the other hand, software technology provides new opportunities for companies and new methods of doing business. This paper investigates the relationship between recent achievements in software, information systems, and process technology on the one hand and the new opportunities facilitated by these technologies on the other. To provide one step forward towards understanding this relationship, this paper discusses recent trends and technologies in software, information systems and process technology. Rather than focusing on the technical details of these domains, the fundamental concepts and the new opportunities are discussed. © 2007 Springer Berlin · Heidelberg.",
Gadman L.,Knowledge creation in commitment-based value networks in multinational organizations,2007,"The digital networked economy has gone global and is reshaping traditional business models. ""Free"" and ""open source"" software (Raymond, 1999), along with more recent successes in the private, public, and social sectors, offer a vision of a radically new globally networked economy. This economy is characterized by new sources of value creation and competition, as barriers to entry are lowered and substitution made easier. It also requires a more stratified, localized approach to the marketplace (Hart & Milstein, 2003) to meet more specialized demands from customers and the societies and environments within which they live. These challenges have implications for almost every aspect of a firm's strategy and business model, especially its ability to leverage these networks to create value through innovation. Yet, most multinational firms are ill-equipped to take advantage of the knowledge creation derived from high-value relationships with suppliers, complementors, and customers. This chapter shows the importance of developing a corporate strategy which takes into account ways in which an innovation focus must integrate with installed business processes. The chapter considers the challenges associated with knowledge disclosure, diffusion, and utilization (Snowdon, 2002; Spinosa, Flores, & Dreyfus, 2001) across value networks and concludes that while successful examples exist in ""free"" and ""open source"" software projects (Raymond, 1999), commercialization of innovation becomes more challenging when increasing levels of personal and financial commitment are required (Mauer, Rai, & Sali, 2004). Choosing the most appropriate value networking strategy can have serious implications for success. This chapter adds to studies on knowledge creation and knowledge transfer in multinational corporations by proposing a conceptual model of commitment-based value networking strategy. It is hoped this will contribute to future research by offering a theoretical foundation upon which this research may be based, and explains why and under what conditions people in commitment-based value networks share knowledge. © 2008, IGI Global.",
Bryant A.,"Government, e-government and modernity: 'The times they are a-changin'; and even the changes are a-changin",2007,"Ideas about E-government sometimes amount to not a great deal more than 'Government-as-usual + ICT'; perhaps the 21st century version of the old Leninist slogan 'Communism = Soviet power + Electrification'. The more incisive commentators and researchers on E-Government - such as those planned for inclusion in this collection - understand that ideas about harnessing the power and potential of ICT are far more complex. To paraphrase the words of Stafford Beer, the question which asks how to use ICT in government is the wrong question; a better formulation is to ask how government should be run given the existence of ICT. The best version of all is the question asking, given ICT, what is the nature of government? Even this, however, fails to get to grips with the context against which all this is taking place. The very nature of government and the role of the state are altering. The current socio-political context has been variously labelled - the information age, the knowledge society, the digital economy, and the informational form of capitalism. Yet these all fail to encapsulate one of the key aspects of contemporary society: Constant and continuously unpredictable change on a global scale but with local and specific impacts. The recent work of Bauman, Beck, Giddens and Sennett amongst others offers a valuable resource against which issues such as E-Government can be understood. This chapter will outline the relevant aspects of what Bauman has termed liquid modernity and the ways in which strategies for E-Government need to take account of this ever-changing socio-political formation. © 2007 The authors and IOS Press.

Welfens P.J.J.,"Information and communication technology: Dynamics, integration and economic stability",2007,"The sector of information and communication technology (ICT) is a major driver of the economy in the 21st century. ICT represents a rising share of investment and R&amp;D in OECD countries and thus is of particular relevance for growth and economic competitiveness. From a EU25 perspective, it also is crucial to note that the expansion of ICT is associated with the growth of a networked society in which the flow of information and technology on the one hand is accelerating; at the same time both ICT and digital networking facilitate international outsourcing and offshoring. Offshoring involves foreign direct investment while international outsourcing occurs through trade and arm's length market transactions. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.",
Hemmert M.,The Korean innovation system: From industrial catch-up to technological leadership?,2007,"South Korea (subsequently: Korea) has achieved unprecedented economic growth and development throughout the last four decades. As a result, the country has been transformed from an underdeveloped economy dominated by agriculture into a full-fledged industrial economy. Most of the countrys stunning economic growth and development, particularly in the early stage of transformation, has been achieved through a rapid industrialization process. This industrialization was enabled by the mobilization of domestic resources (labor and, increasingly, capital) combined with the introduction of foreign technology. In other words, Korea relied to a very high extent on imported technology, including technology embodied in production facilities, during the early stage of its industrialization. International competitiveness was secured by producing commodities as well as increasingly sophisticated goods at a reasonable quality and low cost. However, the internal and external conditions under which the Korean economy operates have changed drastically throughout the last two decades. Since the country has entered the group of high income countries, low labor cost cannot work any more as a competitive weapon. Moreover, as a highly industrialized economy with an increasingly large high tech sector, Korea apparently cannot rely any more predominantly on imported technology. Rather, the internal generation and development of cuttingedge technology has become increasingly important for Korean firms to stay competitive in the world markets for such complex and sophisticated goods as semiconductors, digital displays, mobile phones, or automobiles. This chapter assesses Koreas current technological competitiveness as well as the countrys long term perspectives regarding technology and in novation in a systemic way by analyzing its national innovation system. Thereby, a comprehensive view of the conditions for the generation and diffusion of technology in Korea is provided, and strengths and weaknesses are discussed and evaluated in this overall context. This chapter is organized as follows: First, I will briefly discuss the concept of national innovation systems and explain how it is applied here. Thereafter, the Korean innovation system will be analyzed through a brief historical review and analysis of aggregated indicators, followed by a discussion of its different parts and an overall evaluation. Finally, some implications from the Korean as well as from the non-Korean perspective are briefly outlined. © Physica-Verlag Heidelberg 2007.",
Yost J.R.,A history of computer security standards,2007,"This chapter discusses the history of computer security standards. Computer security has been a fundamental aspect of digital computing for decades, with both getting their start and early funding from the Department of Defense (DoD), but with developments in the industry and the academy becoming all the more prevalent over the past two decades. While the DoD continues to be a force in both networked computing and computer security, its relative place has diminished to an extent because the large and vibrant computer industry has been the epicenter of many computer technology developments and the software security trade has become a fundamental sector of IT security. The preeminent position of the United States in computer security standards has declined as the importance of research throughout the world, and international standards have become more critical in an increasingly global environment and economy. Standards today are created by the marketplace and corporate interactions to a greater extent than ever relative to the military. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
"Carlo J.L., Yoo Y.","""How may I help you?"" Politeness in computer-mediated and face-to-face library reference transactions",2007,"Drawing upon Wittgenstein's theory of language games, we apply a pragmatic approach to organizational communication. The study extends current theories of computer-mediated communication, and explores how language actually gets used across media. We conduct a comparative study of face-to-face versus computer-mediated reference transactions in an academic library, and analyze people's use of politeness strategies. The study observes that people use politeness strategies to play different language games across media, and that a dynamic interplay exists among the three constituents of language games: sense making, language use, and forms of life. In particular, we found that: First, people use significantly more negative politeness strategies and fewer positive politeness strategies online than face-to-face. Second, language use influences people's understanding and precedes practical forms of life. Third, CMC is a different form of life than a face-to-face communication. The new online form of life shapes people's sense making and the way they use language, resulting in emerging new grammars of CMC. Finally, our findings suggest the interplay among multiple forms of life. This study offers important theoretical and managerial implications for organizational communication and the production and delivery of services in the rapidly expanding digital economy. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

"Uzoka F.-M.E., Seleka G.G., Khengere J.",E-commerce adoption in developing countries: A case analysis of environmental and organisational inhibitors,2007,"A number of studies have been conducted on e-commerce and other technology adoption. However, most of these studies have been conducted in developed countries. Developing countries have been slow in fitting into the global digital market. This study attempts to take a comprehensive look at e-commerce development in a developing country, Botswana, which has a very good and well managed economy. The results of the study show that environmental factors affecting the adoption of e-commerce include the internet marketing factor and customer/logistic factor. Though security factor is an issue, it is not statistically significant because other factors, especially organisational such as management support, information availability and communications impact on the organisation's intention and ability to adopt e-commerce. Firm size and gender also affect the intention to and ability to adopt e-commerce. © 2007, Inderscience Publishers.",Developing countries; E-commerce; E-readiness; Internet; Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology
"Jain A., Mandviwalla M., Banker R.D.",Government as catalyst: Can it work again with wireless internet access?,2007,"As the Internet becomes an indispensable component of the global economy, Internet access is an increasingly important prerequisite to exploiting social, economic and educational opportunities. Municipal wireless networks (MWNs), which are wireless Internet access networks created with active local leadership and involvement, are seen as a potential solution. In this case study we describe the development of the Philadelphia MWN including goals, stakeholder expectations, policy, applications, technology, management models, funding, and implementation. The case provides insights on how communities can act as catalysts and use information technology to promote social and economic change. We found that MWNs involve competing private and public sector stakeholders, and it is important to clearly identify the main application of the MWN. We also found that focusing on the digital divide affords both opportunities and risks, and there are powerful external forces that impact MWNs and the underlying technology. © 2007 The American Society for Public Administration.",
Keane M.,Created in China: The great new leap forward,2007,"This book examines China's creative economy-and how television, animation, advertising, design, publishing and digital games are reshaping traditional understanding of culture. Since the 1950s China has endeavoured to catch-up with advanced Western economies. 'Made in China' is one approach to global competitiveness. But a focus on manufacturing and productivity is impeding innovation. China imports creativity and worries about its 'cultural exports deficit'. In the cultural sector Chinese audiences are attracted to Korean, Taiwanese, and Japanese culture, as well as Hollywood cinema. This book provides a fresh look looks at China's move up the global value chain. It argues that while government and (most) citizens would prefer to associate with the nationalistic, but unrealized 'created in China' brand, widespread structural reforms are necessary to release creative potential. Innovation policy in China has recently acknowledged these problems. It considers how new ways of managing cultural assets can renovate largely non-competitive Chinese cultural industries. Together with a history of cultural commerce in China, the book details developments in new creative industries and provides the international context for creative cluster policy in Beijing and Shanghai. © 2007 Michael Keane.

Fikirkoca A.,Unravelling the paradoxes of the (new) digital economy: Myths and realities,2007,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide a selective bibliography and examine the potential of the digital technologies, using an inter-disciplinary literature survey that will contribute to academic and practical knowledge with regard to the understanding of the emerging forms of doing business and competition together with their developmental implications. Design/methodology/approach - The paper examines a survey of a collection of papers that have been published before and after the new economy bubble. These writings then are classified under two main headings: the views of the (new) digital economy proponents and the sceptics. These two opposing approaches are compared and contrasted through the use of five sub-sections: conceptualisation, driving force, spatial/developmental implications, industrial impacts of the digital economy, epistemological/methodological foundations. Findings - The paper finds that claims about the world economy entering into a new phase of a virtuous capitalism or a new international division of labour are over-exaggerated. A more balanced approach should take into consideration both the dynamics of change and continuity without underestimating the future potential of digital technologies. Originality/value - This paper offers a critical assessment of the digital economy, based on an inter-disciplinary literature survey that brings together pieces of work that have previously been analysed largely in a separate manner. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Business planning; Capitalist systems; Communication technologies; Economics; Value chain
"Kyläheiko K., Sandström J.",Strategic options-based framework for management of dynamic capabilities in manufacturing firms,2007,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to launch a dynamic strategic framework for a manufacturing firm for the digital age. The paper's dynamic capabilities- and strategic options-based framework is comprised of the following key issues: how to sense the weak signals at the customer interface and how to formulate them as strategic options; how to exercise these options in the (often) intangible assets markets that are imperfect or even non-existent; how to appropriate and/or share strategically relevant productive knowledge in order to obtain competitive advantage (CA) over the rivals, (iv) how to recognize the opportunities and threats of the underlying industrial structure, especially the economies of scale and scope and network externalities; and how to proactively reconfigure and reshape the existing knowledge base and capabilities in order to sustain the CA obtained. Design/methodology/approach - The paradigm of creating CA is opened up in the context of knowledge-based engineering and digital manufacturing. The Porterian five forces model, the resource-based view and especially its dynamized extension, the dynamic capability view, are used as theoretical starting points. The modern strategic technology management literature will be complemented by means of the concepts of strategic options and related flexibility issues. Some illustrative examples will be offered as well. Findings - In the author's view, the primary sources of sustainable CA in the digital manufacturing can be captured from active asset selection (strategic investments in both tangible and intangible assets), and efficient orchestrating of the global value net in ""thin"" intangible assets markets. The main determinants of CA are: the competitive nature of external environments, supply and demand conditions of the industry (economies of scale and scope and network externalities), renewal capacity of the organization, the dependence on complementary co-specialized resources and capabilities, and the strategic role of the appropriability regime. Originality/value - This paper tries to capture the critical elements of creating sustainable CA in the context of digital manufacturing and it is considered to be useful for strategic decision-makers. The modern technology strategy management literature is synthesized in our framework and it tries to make the issues more applicable to the strategic management of the companies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Competitive advantage; Manufacturing industries; Strategic manufacturing; Transaction costs
"Ray S., Mukherjee A.",Development of a framework towards successful implementation of e-governance initiatives in health sector in India,2007,"The purpose of this paper is to explore the route map for employing efficient e-governance so that at least existing resource and infrastructure are better utilized and deficiencies are tracked for future planning. National health is one of the most important factors in a country's economic growth. India seems to be a victim of the vicious cycle around poor economy and poor health conditions. A detailed study was carried out to find out India's healthcare infrastructure and its standing in e-governance initiatives. After consolidating the fact that effective e-governance can enhance the quality of healthcare service even within limited resources, authors explored success and failure factors of many e-governance initiatives in India and abroad. Finally, an e-governance framework is suggested based on the above factors together with the authors' own experience of implementing e-governance projects in India and abroad. The suggested framework is based on a phased implementation approach. The first phase “Information Dissemination” is more geared towards breaking the “digital divide” across three dimensions: G2Business; G2Citizen; and G2Agent. The most advanced stage is aimed towards joining up healthcare information across the above three dimensions and drawing meaningful analytics out of it. The recommendations also include management of Policies, Scope, Process Reform, Infrastructure, Technology, Finance, Partnership and People for efficient implementation of such e-governance initiatives. The paper provides measures for continuous evaluation of systems as one passes through various stages of implementation. However, the framework can be tested on real or simulated environment to prove its worthiness. This paper can be a potential frame of reference for nation-wide e-healthcare projects not only in India but also in other developing countries. The paper also describes challenges that are most likely to be faced during implementation. Since the paper is practical in nature, the real appeal will be to practitioners who are responsible for implementation of large e-governance initiatives for improving healthcare services. © 2007, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Communication technologies; Health services; Human capital; India; Telecommunications

"Su C.-T., Chen Y.-H., Sha D.Y.-J.",Managing product and customer knowledge in innovative new product development,2007,"In a digital economy, companies face intensive competition and a changing market situation, and thus they make efforts in Knowledge Management (KM) by understanding that knowledge creation is a spiral process of interaction between explicit knowledge and tacit knowledge so as to enhance their competitive advantage in innovation. Product innovation must link technological competence such as engineering and process know-how as well as customer competence such as knowledge of customer needs. The importance of KM in product technological innovation has been critically recognised, whereas the potential for customer KM is not pervasively studied. This inspires the demand to study how congruently managing product knowledge and customer knowledge with the support of Information Technology (IT), does enable the conversion of tacit knowledge into codified knowledge for creating value and reducing risk. It also arouses the motivation to propose an integrated KM model to deal with a high technology product development project.

Currah A.,Managing creativity: The tensions between commodities and gifts in a digital networked environment,2007,"In this paper, I critically examine the management of creativity in a digital networked economic and social environment, which broadly comprises high-speed Internet connections and a diverse ecology of devices and other infrastructure. The non-rivalrous and non-excludable characteristics of information, in this environment, pose distinct challenges for the industrial producers of creativity (such as film studios, publishing houses, record labels). The paper uses the case of media and entertainment to pursue two analytical goals. The first is to conceptualize the networked environment as a seedbed for myriad 'Internet gift economies', which are broadly defined by decentralized social production and sharing of resources within networks of computer users (or peers). The second is to consider the extent to which Internet gift economies can be regulated in a fashion that incorporates scope for some degree of commodification. I therefore seek to identify potential routes towards more balanced 'peer-based' models, which combine the power of Internet gift economies with the ongoing reproduction of industrialized creativity. There is a brief conclusion, where I comment upon the challenges facing the long-term expansion and legalization of Internet gift economies.",Copyright; Creativity; Digital; Entertainment; Gift economies; Internet; Media
"Ravichandran T., Pant S., Chatterjee D.",Impact of industry structure and product characteristics on the structure of B2B vertical hubs,2007,"Business-to-business (B2B) vertical hubs are expected to play an important role in the digital economy and add value by reducing inefficiencies in industrial procurement and enabling efficient interfirm interactions and collaborations. The last few years have witnessed both a proliferation of business models underlying these hubs and the failure of many of these hubs. This study identifies key structural dimensions of vertical hubs and develops a conceptual framework to characterize vertical hubs. We draw from the industrial organization theory and the marketing literature to examine the relationship between the characteristics of the vertical hubs, those of the industries they serve, and the products transacted through the hubs. Based on data collected from 63 B2B vertical hubs, we test our hypotheses relating industry and product characteristics to the structure of vertical hubs. The results provide modest support to our theoretical proposition that the characteristics of vertical hubs are likely to be shaped by the industry and product characteristics. We interpret the results and discuss the implications of the study for research and practice. © 2007 IEEE.",E-business models; E-procurement; Electronic markets; Industry structure

The economy is driven by Brownian motion in random time that is taken to be continuous and independent of Brownian motion. European options are priced by the no-arbitrage principle as conditional averages of their classical values over the random time to maturity. The prices are path dependent in general unless the time derivative of the random time is Markovian. An explicit self-financing hedging strategy is shown to replicate all European options by dynamically trading in stock, money market, and digital calls on realized variance. The notion of the average price is introduced, and the average price of the call option is shown to be greater than the corresponding Black-Scholes price for all deep in- and out-of-the-money options under appropriate sufficient conditions. The model is implemented in limit lognormal random time. The significance of its multiscaling law is explained theoretically and verified numerically to be a determining factor of the term structure of implied volatility. © World Scientific Publishing Company.",Average price; Implied volatility; Limit log-normal time; Multiscaling; Path dependence; Random time
"Nikitakos N., Lambrou M.A.",Chapter 12 Digital Shipping: The Greek Experience,2007,"While electronic business (e-business) is developing rapidly, the pace and pattern of development of these technologies and related business practices are quite variable across countries and industries. In the shipping industry today, we observe various implementations and modes of use of maritime electronic services, which target at the facilitation of maritime business operations and tasks such as, chartering, procurement, manning, planned maintenance, technical and operational monitoring of the vessels, voyage planning and navigation as well as safety, security and emergency operations. Additionally, great efforts are made in order to integrate applications and provide value-added services. For some scholars, the global economy is converging towards common, homogenized and integrated organizational models, whereas e-business methods are seen as a set of practices congruent with the ""modern"" way of organizing economic activities. In our work, we review current practices and emergent patterns regarding digital shipping, we cite empirical evidence on e-readiness and maturity related with e-business models, digital modes of operation and enabling technologies, as well as perceptions of key barriers and incentives in the Greek-owned shipping sector, as interlinked with overall firm characteristics and strategies. Whereas in the Greek-owned financially robust shipping sector, we observe a low level of use and very moderate technology evolution trends, we seek a more thorough understanding of the digital mode of operation in the international shipping industry context; we devise a combined frame of analysis consisting of (a) a typology of digital shipping business models and (b) an extended Technology Acceptance Model for digital shipping. We consider postulations about emergent digital shipping modes of operation and important determinants of an organizational decisional context, as essential means in order to set digital shipping strategies, design market policies, and design and implement business models and technical options towards a future frictionless and networked shipping environment. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

"Howe N., Strauss W.",The next 20 years: How customer and workforce attitudes will evolve,2007,"Business projects with very long time horizons - such as those involving product R&D, workplace design, and total compensation planning - have to contend with a crucial question; What will be the needs, demands, and desires of consumers and employees decades from now? If you think the answer is ""Just more of the same,"" you're in for a surprise. Howe and Strauss, the authors of Generations, The Fourth Turning, Millenniais Rising, and other books, have studied the differences among generations for some 30 years. Their extensive research has revealed a fascinating pattern -one so strong that it supports a measure of predictability. On the basis of historical precedent, they say, we can foresee how the generations that are alive today will think and act in decades to come. Three of those generations will still be vital forces in American society 20 years from now: Boomers, Generation X, and Millennial. Their attitudes and behaviors will have profound effects on the economy, the workplace, and social institutions in general. For example, as aging Boomers eschew high-tech medicine in favor of holistic self-care, natural foods, and mind-body healing techniques, some hospitals are opening new wings featuring alternative medicine and spiritual counseling. Gen Xers, having grown up in an era of failing schools and marriages, will remain alienated, disaffected, and pragmatic as they enter midlife. Already the greatest entrepreneurial generation in U.S. history, they will be highly effective at pushing innovation, efficiency, and mass customization. In contrast, young adult Millennial will favor teamwork, close family relationships, job security, and a bland popular culture. Their unprecedented digital empowerment and talent for organizing will create a political powerhouse and may even revitalize the union movement.",

Design/methodology/approach - In the proposed network model, socially-responsible investment organizations (SRIOs) collaborate with corporations to enhance the flow of information through the network, providing a key focal point and filter for information to and from the various stakeholders of the corporation. Findings - Illustrations show SRIOs becoming a catalyst towards best practices, emphasizing strategic options, monitoring functions, benchmarking peer firms, and providing stronger linkages to the global environment. Research limitations/implications - The model is illustrated with anecdotal evidence. Practical implications - Utilizing SRIOs as intermediaries in the relationship between businesses and their multiple stakeholders is attractive because SRIOs possess the capabilities and skills of experts and matchmakers. The implications of increased access to information and greater valuation of corporate social responsibility are projected as a result of the SRIOs' role as expert, driving greater accountability with increased access to information. It is also seen as a direct result of the SRIOs' role as matchmaker, providing more explicit valuation of corporate social responsibility. Originality/value - In the global economy, the concept of ""managing stakeholders"" may be an anachronism. As the importance of corporate social responsibility grows, efforts to address corporations' social responsibilities are increasingly challenged by: the complexity of globalization; the immediacy of digital networks; and the blurring of organizational boundaries. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Corporate social responsibility; Social networks; Stakeholder analysis

Practical implications: The adoption of international standard model is easier to implement a supply chain system and the business value is also can be achieved if the electronic data exchange is carried over the internet. Originality/value: The system model presented in this paper can be a valuable reference for further similar development to build an electronic business to achieve the low cost, high efficiency, high security message exchange for digital firms at this internet era. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Electronic commerce; Electronic data interchange; Internet; Supply chain management; Value chain
Sensarkar N.,The potential impact of digital rights management on the Indian entertainment industry,2007,"For India, having being endowed with a rich heritage of art and culture, copyright is perceived to offer potential rewards. The entertainment industry is one of the fastest growing sectors in the Indian economy. At present, India is not a signatory to the WIPO Internet Treaties, but the government has proposed amendments to the extant legislation to incorporate Digital Rights Management (DRM) as enshrined in them. Conventionally the western entertainment industry has viewed DRM as an important tool to combat piracy pervasive on the internet. DRM involves the application of a set of technical and legal mechanisms that allow copyright owners to control the access to their works, determine the types of permissible uses and terms of such uses and the ultimate distribution of their works in the digital world. With the growing popularity of Indian cinema abroad, the entertainment industry is attracting increasing foreign investment, is gradually being corporatised and thus it is felt that such investments need to be protected. DRM is considered to be one of the solutions as it prevents loss due to unlimited unauthorized reproduction of works, introduces more effective market segmentation and promotes the incentive to create, facilitating the maximum exploitation of works in the digital world. However, for India, a developing economy, such a path is to be treaded with caution. DRM is an extra-statutory measure, with perceived potential impact on consumer privacy, innovation and limiting legitimate exceptions. A unique feature of the industry is that it is an extension of its dynamic indigenous folk and classical cultural tradition where the emphasis has been on adaptation and improvisation, drawing upon works in the public domain. Some experts observe that DRM poses a threat to such a tradition by artificially restricting the public domain.This paper explores the likely impact of the proposed introduction of the DRM provisions in the Indian Copyright Act, 1957 with its focus on Bollywood and the related music sector. Given the tension surrounding DRM, this paper examines the aforementioned issues, taking into consideration the promotion of the underlying objectives of copyright law. Noting that the case for strong copyright protection as a key for innovation is highly debatable, this paper argues that India should keep in mind the flexibilities under law as provided by various international treaties and in technology before adopting the DRM approach. © 2007, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Bollywood; Copyright; Digital rights; Indian economy; Piracy; WTO

Gurău C.,Digital B2B interactions in Romania: An exploratory study of the level of satisfaction of client organisations,2007,"The development of new information technology and telecommunication (ITT) devices has increased the complexity of business-to-business (B2B) interactions, forcing the service organisations to adopt a multi-channel, customer-oriented approach. The purpose of this study is to present an exploratory study of B2B interactions in Romania, which measures the preference of both service providers and client firms for various channels of interaction, and identifies the main dimensions of the interactive process. The primary data were collected through an e-mail questionnaire that was answered by 113 service providers and 102 client organisations, and then analysed using the SPSS statistical package. Five main interaction dimensions have been identified as the framework used by client organisations to evaluate the quality of B2B interactions. These dimensions are complex constructs that have a double projection in the context of ITT systems and CRM procedures. The process of B2B interactions is poorly documented for transition economies, such as Romania. After describing the dimensions of B2B interactions, the paper proposes a diagnostic procedure for evaluating the perception gaps between the service provider firm and the client organisation, concerning the quality level of each dimension. This diagnostic can be adapted and used by each service provider organisation to identify the possible areas of customer dissatisfaction and the requirements for future improvements. © 2007, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Business-to-business marketing; Customer satisfaction; Romania

As broadband becomes more widely diffused in developing countries, there is great potential to increase the number of people who are connected. Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) and Worldwide interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) are not only revolutionizing broadband communications in the developed world but they also offer to developing countries the opportunity to bridge the digital divide that may exist in their communities. As emerging markets look for opportunities to ""leap-frog"", they can quickly adapt to next-generation wireless technologies like Wi-Fi and WiMAX, thereby gaining advantages over other traditional wired infrastructures. Policymakers should seek suitable strategies to promote vital broadband technologies that offer beneficial alternatives to traditional cable and DSL. We propose a strategic wireless framework to address challenges in three different economic sectors of a developing country: Tier I or metro economy, which is well-urbanized and integrated with the global economy; Tier II or sub-urban economy, which has niche economic or development activities compared to Tier I; and Tier III or the rural economy, characterized by informal economic activity and poverty. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

"Dhar V., Sundararajan A.",Information technologies in business: A blueprint for education and research,2007,"How are business schools thinking about developing leaders for the emerging digital economy? Is there a set of core principles we can apply to thinking about the enabling potential of information technologies and their consequences for business and society? We present a business-centric framework and a technology-centric framework that together form a blueprint for answering these questions. The business-centric framework articulates three compelling reasons why information technology (IT) matters in business: (1) IT continually transform industry and society, (2) executive decisions about IT investments, governance, and strategy are critical to organizational success, and (3) deriving value from increasingly available data trails defines effective decision making in the digital economy. However, our conversations with the leadership of 45 business schools and our subsequent data indicate that business schools are challenged by effectively training future executives to think about these reasons and act on them as part of a forward-looking program of business education that is grounded in stable concepts. In response, the technology-centric framework provides a set of grounding concepts and stable principles about IT that have emerged over the last four decades, and leads to a natural set of consequences that can inform thinking about IT in business. We illustrate how these complementary frameworks-business and technology-can be combined to frame an educational program by outlining a set of key questions, by placing these questions in the context suggested by our frameworks, and by providing guidelines toward answering them. These questions also define a natural path for future research about IT in business and society that will lead to stronger intellectual foundations for the field and define future education that is better grounded in concepts and theories that emerge from academic research. © 2007 INFORMS.",Business transformation; Business value; Corporate strategy; Decision making; Digital goods; Disruptive technology; Education; Electronic commerce; IT investment; IT strategy; MBA core; Network economics; Platform; Social networks
"Brousseau E., Curien N.","Internet economics, digital economics",2007,"Introduction Since the “privatization” of the Internet in the United States in the mid-1990s, the network of networks has developed rapidly. This has been matched by a wave of innovation in information technology, as well as in many areas of its application, giving rise to a multitude of on-line services and new “business models”. In the same period, the United States experienced unprecedented non-inflationist growth. As a result of this conjunction, certain commentators considered the Internet as the heart of a new growth regime, qualified as the “new economy”. This contributed to the creation and then amplification of a speculative bubble around businesses involved in the Internet. As these unfounded hopes necessarily met with disappointment, the euphoria disappeared at the turn of the 21st century. At the same time, the forecasts of a certain number of economists were confirmed a posteriori. These forecasts had highlighted, firstly, that the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) does not lead ipso facto to an improvement in microeconomic performances (Brousseau and Rallet [1999]); secondly, that information goods and services do not escape from the fundamental rules of economics (Shapiro and Varian [1999]); and thirdly that American growth in the 1990s was not necessarily founded on the innovations linked to the use of ICTs exclusively (Gordon [2000], Cohen and Debonneuil [2000], Artus [2001]). However, these analyses do not claim that nothing changes with the large-scale dissemination of these digital networks and their associated practices. © Cambridge University Press 2007 and Cambridge University Press, 2009.",

"Rallet A., Rochelandet F.",ICTs and inequalities: The digital divide,2007,"Introduction At the beginning of the 1990s, authors argued that globalization went hand in hand with the “end of geography”, implying the declining relevance of spatial considerations in shaping patterns of industry organization, owing to the development of information and communication technologies (ICTs) and the Internet (O'Brien, 1992). Virtual space was supposed to act as a substitute for physical space. This naïve thesis was quickly criticized insofar as the Internet is a virtual network strongly rooted in the physical space of geography. But how does space matter in analyzing a network such as the Internet and its economic impacts? There are several ways to deal with this question. Some papers have emphasized the logistical constraints of the virtual world, more precisely the dialectics induced by the use of ICTs between “de-territorialization” and “re-territorialization” of economic activities. The Internet allows the virtualization of certain aspects of economic activities (online orders for e-commerce, for instance) but implies that other aspects should be embedded in physical space (after-sales service or repair service must be close to customers). Other papers have looked into the geographic impacts of the Internet: are Internet uses biased in favor of agglomeration or dispersion trends? Models of economic geography (Fujita and Thisse, 2000) show that the decline of communication costs through geographical space, as transport costs, tends to polarize more and more economic activities because distance is no longer an obstacle for agglomeration factors such as economies of scale, indivisibilities, social interactions, etc. © Cambridge University Press 2007 and Cambridge University Press, 2009.",

We focus on a private-public training initiative and its impact on the socially excluded, specifically lone women parents. Narrative data from four United Kingdom educational sites participating in this computer network engineer training program highlight a systemic paradox: that ICT skills development initiatives designed to support lone women parents are simultaneously working in opposition to broader policy goals such as work-life balance and ironically serve to reproduce the participants' classification as socially excluded. The assumptions underpinning the model of social inclusion driving the ICT skills training course are analyzed critically using the concepts of community of practice, classificatory systems, and marginalization. Our findings suggest that ICT training courses and initiatives should be accompanied by changes in pedagogic practice that accommodate the more wide-ranging needs of those targeted for inclusion, as well as changes in employment settings. We conclude by exploring the implications of this for government policy formation, business vendor qualifications, the design of ICT skills training initiatives, and our understanding of the role of ICT skills in overcoming the digital divide.",Community of practice; Digital divide; Gender; ICT skills training; Marginalization; Network engineer; Social exclusion; Work-life balance

Polo M.,Regulation for pluralism in media markets,2007,"Introduction Pluralism – the fair, balanced and unbiased representation of a wide range of political opinions and views – is a fundamental component in the working of modern democracies. Assuring pluralism in modern economies, characterised by a well-developed set of media markets, requires political and social actors from across the spectrum to have proper access to the different media. The last two decades have seen an impressive development in the number and range of media that today contribute to form public opinion, with technological innovations and new policies leading the process. Cable and satellite transmission during the 1980s relaxed the constraint of limited frequencies over the hertzian spectrum that had previously restricted the number of TV channels. Moreover, these technologies, together with encrypted signals over the air, enabled exclusion of non-payers and thereby contributed to the development of pay-TV services, adding a new source of revenues for private operators. At the same time, public policies more favourable to private companies promoted wide reforms of broadcasting markets in Europe, where commercial channels financed with advertising started to erode the audience of the incumbent public channels. Today there are many more channels available to the public than two decades ago. The current phase of development of digital broadcasting will further increase the number and nature of TV services offered to the public, with a convergence between media and telecommunication industries. © Cambridge University Press 2007 and 2009.",
"Mandelli A., Neirotti P., Canato A., Biffi A., Paolucci E., Cantamessa M., Parolini C.",The Italy business and information technologies (BIT) survey,2007,"The major intent of this project is to study the impact of new information technologies on industry structure, firms' practices and strategic results. Our research team, since 2002, has worked on this research agenda. The study that we present here builds on the results of the first Business and Information Technologies (BIT) study developed in Italy in 2002-2003 (see DeMatté et al., forthcoming), which highlighted three important phenomena: first, the substantial difference in the rate of digitization of core processes, between firms of different sizes and information and communication technologies (ICT) governance complexity, which could be explained not only by different firms' capabilities, but also by the different role of technology in specific competitive contexts. Second, the different rate of digitization of different organizational processes: digital investments were much higher in the internal processes, and much lower in external relationships, with both customers and suppliers (e-commerce and e-procurement were not highly diffused). Third, the importance of cultural, social and organizational variables, not only as a precondition for the success of e-business projects, but also as a complementary ""effect"" of the projects themselves. Our second survey built on these results, aims to collect more detailed data on the same critical areas: (1) different and specific areas of adoption; (2) the ICT governance processes; (3) the organizational and social processes (capabilities and changes) related to ICT business impact; (4) the general business results related to ICT innovation. This report synthesizes the results we found with this 2004-2005 survey. The Italian 2004 BIT dataset includes data collected through a survey of the chief information officer managers of a sample of the larger Italian companies, carried outbetweenOctober 2004 and April 2005.The respondents could fill in the questionnaire using the phone, the mail, and the web. The usable questionnaires were 214 out of 2326 invited answers (the response rate was 9.2%). We have analyzed the results of the 2004-2005 BIT survey, focusing in particular on two areas of knowledge: (1) the processes of ICT adoption and ICT governance; (2) the relationship between firm's intangible resources and ICT processes and effects, at the organizational and business level. In this survey, we found that: • At this stage and for the type of firms considered (the larger firms), there is not any digital divide between Southern andNorthern Italy in the spending for information technology (IT), despite of the economic diversity of the two areas. • There is not any divide between Italian and foreign companies operating in Italy, since foreign groups doing business in Italy do not showhigher spending rates for IT. • The real divide, consistent with what we found in the previous BIT study, is related to the different IT investment efforts made by companies of different sizes. • The nature of the industry helps in explaining the different IT adoption processes; the level of spending is significantly higher in the information intensive businesses of the service industries (financial services, consulting, and telecommunications). With regard to the applications adopted and technology use: • Corporate intranets and corporatewebsites represent the most diffused applications, while aminority of companies have explored e-procurement, e-commerce and other innovative frontiers in collaborative supply chains, in line with what we found in the first study, that is, that Italian companies have started to digitize internal processes more than external relationships, and communication processes more than commercial activities (Dematté et al., forthcoming). This phenomenon is particularly interesting, if we consider the average size of our sample companies. • The most innovative systems, radio frequency identification and e-learning platforms, still have a very limited diffusion, also confirming that the Italian companies tend to be late in the innovation cycle. • It is also worth mentioning that the size of the company and the nature of the industry (more or less information-intensive) influence the type of activities performed online, and therefore the sophistication of the digital communication forms. Also, the organizational complexity and richness of the firm is important; our correlation analysis in fact showed that ICT adoption and ICT adoption trend are higher not only in companies distributed geographically (number of organizational units in Italy), but also in companies with a higher degree of organizational capital, marketbased social capital, and innovation orientation. With regard to the changes (strategic and organizational) induced in the organization: • In the majority of firms, the number of employees who now use these new communication and information instruments has increased, the ICT function has become more integrated in the production processes, and there are more instruments to support employees in their decisions. • New communication technologies have also started to change the way firms and people work, in the direction of what we call ""digital enterprise"", an enterprise connected and coordinated through digital communication (firms are now more geographically dispersed; in many of them videoconferencing has substituted business travels, and they use internet-based systems to coordinate employees). • Despite these changes, the organizational impact of ICT investments is varied. Considering the perceived effect of ICT, in only a minority of firms the organizational structure seem to have become flatter, and employees are believed to have increased their power (components of what we call new organizational capital or new organizational capabilities). • A richer explanation of how the ICT processes impact the organization can be derived by the analysis of the influence of the organizational and social capital on the ICT processes, and how the combination of these different resources with ICT can dynamically produce new capabilities and business advantages, beyond the organizational change called ""digital enterprise"". ICT adoption is in fact also correlated to significant changes in the organizational structure and capabilities. With regard to the impact of ICT on firms' performance: • Themajority of the managers surveyed believed that their firms have achieved important results in the organizational and operational productivity areas, while it appeared more problematic in recognizing the benefits in terms of commercial efficiency, positive impact on successful new product development, and new strategic learning. In conclusion we can say that, in general, the direction of ICT innovation in Italy has not much changed, even though the digital investments of firms seem to have increased (we cannot do a direct comparison because the two samples in the studies are different). There is still a divide related to the size of the firms and there is a tendency to invest more on internal communication and information processing than on the digitization of the external relationships and supply chain collaboration. This is particularly significant considering that we have surveyed some of the largest companies in the country.We know that this situation can draw a negative light on the Italian potential to explore the new frontiers of innovation and global competition. No country and no company can afford to consider itself protected and isolated in its local markets and capabilities. Italian firms should learn and dare to explore the newfrontiers of digital innovation in the awareness that ICT is not just a technology for doing the ame things as before, in a more convenient and efficient way. ICT can become a strategi variable in firms, if it combines with new capabilities, new organization, and new pictures of the economy and the world. © 2006 by World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd.

"Williams B., Nikolic Z., Maur G.",Adas: Making cars safer to drive,2006,"Processed data from the active safety and advanced driver assistance systems (Adas) overcomes the automotive accident problems and increases accident avoidance. Adas increases driver awareness of the possible hazards, and potentially improves the reaction times with such features as lane departure warning systems, drowsiness detection, and night vision. High consumer acceptance is expected to drive market demand for these features. Adas has been implemented in luxury cars, and as the technology gets implemented on mass-market vehicles, higher volumes would bring great cost economies. Adas provide the added benefit of offering important product differentiation, as the passenger safety systems are becoming standard features. The most efficient way to handle the challenges related to higher resolution is to execute multiple algorithms on a single digital signal processor (DSP).",

Simsek A.,Digital access and human development,2006,"Human development has traditionally been associated with factors in the economy, health, and education. In recent years, however, access to digital technologies has been considered a significant indicator of sustainable human development. It appears that an inclusive and active information society cannot be accomplished without providing digital access to a considerable majority of the society. It is also true that development goals of countries can be achieved better when government, private, and civil society combine their efforts through innovative strategies to establish productive communication regarding the effective uses of digital technologies. Improper strategies, on the other hand, carry the risk of widening the digital divide between the advantaged and disadvantaged groups so that the information gap results in increased inequalities between the rich and poor, as well as the high-educated and low-educated. Therefore, the overarching policy of contemporary societies should be making new technologies work for human development and social progress.",Digital access; Digital divide; Human development; ICT; Information society

Filos E.,Smart organizations in the digital age,2006,"The chapter aims to present and explain the concept of the smart organization. This concept arose from the need for organizations to respond dynamically to the changing landscape of a digital economy. A smart organization is understood to be both internetworked and knowledge-driven, and therefore able to adapt to new organizational challenges rapidly. It is sufficiently agile to respond to opportunities of the digital age. The three networking dimensions of smart organizations, ICT-enabled virtuality, organizational teaming, and knowledge hyperlinking, are elaborated. This networking capability allows smart organizations to cope with complexity and with rapidly changing economic environments. The paper also shows how managing the smart organization requires a more ""fuzzy"" approach to managing smart resources: people, information, knowledge, and creativity. Research is also presented, mainly from the European perspective. It has been key to creating the conditions for organizations to become smart. © 2006, Idea Group Inc.",
Mahale G.,Colour regime: Digital printed textiles,2006,"An attempt was made to explore and process different types of textile designs using CAD applications, to investigate the creative potential of CAD applications in conjunction with design outputs on different types of textiles and to study the image quality of digitally printed textiles. Three Tie-Dye samples were selected. The Pixel dimensions and the size of the samples varied according to cloth design and design repeat. Images were scanned while three design output devices were selected. Six substrates were selected to study the image quality using computer printer and digital printer. Design editing was done in three stages using color reduction, image cleaning and image mode. After the printing process, the fabric sample was allowed to dry overnight. Printed and dried samples were subjected to steaming using high pressure steamer. Among the calibrations used to print the textile images cotton mimaki was found to be the best followed by MMU. Percentage Shrinkage varied from 0.74% to 1.06% in width direction and 2.54% to 2.60% in height direction. Cotton satin samples attained the highest Percentage Shrinkage followed by silk and cotton. Images qualities differed among printers, but paper quality and substrates also have been a factor. Ink jet printing of textiles has already established itself for initial sample production since this offers very fast customer response, versatility and economy.",
"Nandavadekar V.D., Pawar R.G., Ujagare S.P.",Controlling techniques and documentation standards for E-commerce,2006,"In the report of digital economy June 2000, the U. S. department of Commerce declared that digital economy is no longer emerging; but it has already arrived and therefore, it is increasingly important that companies actively participate in digital economy to remain competitive. The meaning of the term ""Electronic Commerce"" has changed over time. Originally, ""electronic commerce"" meant the facilitation of commercial transactions electronically, usually using technology like Electronic Data Interchange (EDI, introduced in the late 1970s) to send commercial documents like Purchase Orders or Invoices electronically. Later it came to include activities more precisely termed ""Web Commerce"" - the purchase of goods and services over the World Wide Web via secure servers (note HTTPS, a special server Protocol which Encrypts confidential ordering data for customer protection) with E-Shopping Carts and with electronic pay services, like Credit Card payment authorizations.In this paper researchers tried to examines business in virtual world through E-Commerce. The word Virtual means 'object' or 'thing' which does not have physical existence in this world but the process takes place technically by using electronic device. In today's marketplace, a basic level of product features with minimum quality is required for market entry, but it is not sufficient for any significant market penetration. It focuses on various issue of E-Commerce (EC). The key success factors of E-Commerce is presented in this paper like value to customer, services and performance, sales, promotion, relationship etc. In our study we found that problems with E-Commerce faced by customers like security, competitive situation, employee commitment etc. This study extends to product suitability, trust of E-Commerce and acceptance of E-Commerce. It also suggests that technology is important factor to consider in selection entry mode. As a result of technology, distance is no longer a barrier to the international marketing of services, some service from can become global from the beginning because of the ease with which online transaction can transfer national border, services firms do not need to undergo all the traditional step of entry. More selection such as determining market potential and examining entry barriers before went using abroad. Documentation standards can facilitate communication. Between functions within the e-commerce organization, by ensuring that information is presented in consistent form. This can speed up communication, improve understanding of the functions and process, and make sure that all the necessary information is included. It is not the purpose of this paper to give detailed documentation and controlling standards but to indicate the areas that might be covered in the appropriate procedure.Adequate security is now accepted as a basic requirement for every e-commerce or networked system. This applies to all the underlying components like the LAN, Firewall, Routers, Internet, and so on. But how do you ensure that the security is appropriate and up to scratch? How do you know that there are no major exposures? How do you audit it methodically? This study is an effort to examine ways that technology has redefined. Trust is important to the success of EDI or E-Commerce in which partner is identifiable. E-Commerce technology is to increase the efficiency of service, production and delivery. Due to the size of the task establishing personnel contact there will be the increasing need for tools to aid in structuring these marketing relationships. This is role of the internet in relationship marketing. © 2006 IEEE.",
"Samulevičius J., Samonis V.",Business process outsourcing to emerging markets: A knowledge management approach to models and strategies,2006,"A major phenomenon of globalization, outsourcing is a complex and controversial issue. It occurs when companies contract out activities previously performed in-house or in-country to foreign (usually offshore) companies globally. Couched in the terms of a SWOT analysis and using a modified Harvard-style case study that was subjected to the SWOT analysis, the chapter analyzes business process outsourcing (BPO) to emerging markets, frequently called outsourcing or offshoring in short. The overarching advantage of outsourcing is that it allows a business to focus on core activities as called for by core competence, strategic alliance, and competitive advantage theories of international business. Such a global restructuring of production has been sometimes called the true WMD (weapon of mass destruction) of jobs in the developed world. However, a more balanced approach could borrow the term ""creative destruction"" from the prominent Austrian economist Josef Schumpeter and emphasize the allimportant transformational aspect of outsourcing. A transformational aspect of outsourcing is evidently very important for emerging markets but also for many companies in the developed world; therefore, BPO is sometimes called BTO (business transformational outsourcing). The global digital/knowledge economy offers unprecedented opportunities to produce and sell on a mass scale, reduce costs, and customize to the needs of consumers, all at the same time. Whether you live in a large country such as the U.S. or China, mid-sized country such as Canada or a smaller country such as Lithuania, your potential market is of the same global size. And you can source (netsource) inexpensively wherever you wish. Added to that are immensely increased opportunities to access new knowledge and technologies, driving productivity and living standards further up. BPO to emerging markets is or should be driven by those fundamental reasons having to do with rapid organizational change, reshaping business models to make them viable in the long term, and launching new strategies. This is the essence of transformational outsourcing. In this chapter, BPO is used in the broader, integrated, and comprehensive understanding of changes in the company's business models and strategies but first of all the company's changing core competencies and competitive advantages: partnering with another company to achieve a rapid, substantial, and sustainable improvement in company-level performance. A knowledge management approach is advocated in this research that is to be continued in the future. The chapter concludes that outsourcing is a wave of the future. Postcommunist and other emerging markets countries are well advised to jump to these new opportunities as they represent the best chance yet to realize the ""latecomer's advantage"" by leapfrogging to technologies and models of doing business which are new for Western countries as well. The chapter analyzes and outlines some of the ways in which contemporary and future business models are deeply transformed by the global digital/knowledge economy. Global outsourcing provides a compelling platform to research the issues of upgrading competitive advantage in developed countries and contract out non-core competencies to emerging markets. Therefore, suggestions for further research are included in the chapter as well. © 2006, Idea Group Inc.",
"Carayannis E.G., Ziemnowicz C.",Information and communication technology-enabled economic growth and convergence: Examples from the EU's central and Southeastern European members,2006,"Globalization can be viewed as a process of increased freedom and capacity of individuals and firms to conduct economic activities with residents of other countries. The driving forces of globalization stem from the reduction in barriers for conducting business across political and geographic barriers, as well as the reduction and convergence of transaction costs via advances in ""transport of information."" There is a consensus that innovation and the accompanying progress in information and communication technology (ICT) serve as a catalyst for economic growth. This chapter discusses the ICT environment within the Central and Southeastern European (CSEE) counties and the changes in this sector within the European Union (EU). Examination of strategies taken by these nations to improve their economic performance may offer decision makers in other regions some options to deal with impending changes. Particular emphasis is on the efforts of CSEE nations to build a creditable government, reliable political system, and competitive economy. These nations serve as a laboratory for implementing radical changes in their political economy from a centrally planned, one-party system to a democratic market-based system. Specific recommendations include emphasis on effectual dissemination of information between purchasers and suppliers. Information broadcasting is highly related to the creation of an efficient digital system. Specific needs include improved capacity to standardize reports, forms and information transmission functions. Furthermore, IT support and training programs are essential to reduce market distortions. © 2006, Idea Group Inc.",
Stevens K.,A dissemination strategy for the management of knowledge in rural communities,2006,"Schools in rural communities of the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador have been reorganized in the last decade. Because of rural to urban migration and the consequent challenge to the continued existence of many small schools, new academically and administratively open structures have been established within an Internet-based environment. Accordingly, traditional closed, autonomous schools in this province have increasingly become open sites within Internet-linked teaching and learning environments. What began as a research project linking eight schools in a single Digital Intranet has been extended to include schools across the province managed by a recently established branch of the Department of Education of Newfoundland and Labrador-the Centre for Distance Learning and Innovation. This chapter provides an outline of how information and communication technologies have been used to reshape education in a predominantly rural Canadian province, thereby preparing people for participation in the emerging knowledge-based economy. © 2007, Idea Group Inc.",
Welfens P.J.J.,"Information and communications technology, regulations and growth: Theory and key policy issues",2006,"The world economy has become increasingly shaped by regional integration efforts in the 1990s. According to the WTO Report from 2002, only North Korea, Japan and Libya had not been involved in regional integration schemes at the beginning of the 21st century. Many motives stand behind regional integration schemes with economic aspects being a major element of the respective policy initiatives. Relatively poor countries are expected to gain from economic integration and to benefit from enhanced growth (BRETSCHGER, 2004). As regards economic growth, it is clear that not only integration and technological progress play a role but that monetary dynamics - including exchange rate changes (real appreciation in EU accession countries in the late 1990s vs. a real depreciation in most ASEAN countries) - can affect economic performance. The EU has reinforced the integration process with the introduction of the Euro and the European Central Bank in 1999, but it also has expanded by way of EU eastern enlargement in 2004. In 2004, ASEAN countries decided to accelerate full steps towards a free trade area for the six original member countries of 1967. Fast trade integration in Asia where ASEAN countries are eager to expand free trade arrangements with both China and India and possibly other countries indicates that the creation of regional trading blocs might be reinforced. At the same time economic globalization is continuing, mainly through high foreign direct investment and increasing ""digital integration"" which is partly based on the internet and new information and communication technology (ICT). ICT has become a key field of innovation and investment in the triad in the 1980s and 1990s. Since the 1990s, new technological opportunities and competition- enhancing effects have emerged through digital convergence - the fact that digitization has blurred traditional market demarcations for voice transmission, TV transmission and data transmission. The liberalization of telecommunications worldwide has stimulated international communication and trade: • In the 1990s, the internet emerged as the first global communication platform; main activity is business to business (B2B), only smaller fraction of ecommerce is business to consumer (B2C) or consumer to consumer (C2C). A prominent case for B2B is Covisint, a joint digital platform of automotive firms for buying intermediate inputs, and in the field of C2C, Ebay. These serve as examples of WALRAS meets Gates, that is digital auctioning on a softwarebased digital platform; • Telecommunications markets were liberalized in most countries in the 1990, which not only helped to reduce telecommunications prices and stimulate digital innovations. It also gave new impulses to the telecommunications equipment industry where firms learned to deal less and less with state-owned monopoly operators but more and more with privatized telecommunications operators facing sustained competition; • These technological and political developments have contributed to global standard setting in the telecommunications equipment industry; • Digital communication in virtual networks have become a cheap highperformance option to effectively organize activities of multinational companies (MNCs). Given the imperfections of the markets for information, the long term move towards knowledge-based societies in Europe, Asia, North America and elsewhere is likely to reinforce the role of firm-internal transactions and hence the role of MNCs. The long term rise in the ratio for R&D expenditures to national income is reinforcing the growing role of MNCs, whose prime impulse for expansion is the drive to internationally exploit ownership specific advantages or to reinforce such advantages by international asset-seeking investment (read: investment in technology-intensive firms); • E-government has become a growing field of government activity and naturally also a new element of cross-border cooperation; • The WTO is involved in defining a global framework for digital products (GATT) and digital services (GATS; weaker set of rules), which is necessary in a world economy with a rising share of tradable digital goods and services; • National governments and regional integration clubs - such as the EU and ASEAN - have started digital initiatives to promote regional integration and cooperation. Research by VAN ARK/PIATKOWSKI (2004) shows that not only leading OECD countries benefit from an increasing use of ICT, but that relatively poor eastern European countries also have experienced increased productivity in the context of the accumulation of ICT capital. Indeed, ICT has been found in many studies to be quite important for productivity growth (e.g. VAN ARK, 2001; RGER, 2002; WELFENS, 2003). There is no doubt that technological progress in the production of ICT goods is high which implies high productivity and output growth in the ICT producing sector. The high rate of technical progress in the ICT producing sector reduces the relative price of ICT investment goods and therefore stimulates accumulation of such investment goods. The relative price fell by about 8% p.a. in the US and France in the period from 1970 to 1991. From 1991 to 1999, relative price fell by about 15% in the US in but only by about 10% in France during the same period. In Germany, the producer prices of the OCM industry (OCM=office, computing and accounting machinery) fell by only 1.2% p.a. in 1970-91 and 4.4% p.a. in 1991-99 (FALK/KOEBEL, 2004). This might partly explain the relatively modest IT-investment-GDP ratio in Germany as compared to leading EU countries and the US. In the US, the total stock of quality adjusted computer equipment in constant prices increased with a growth rate of 20% over several years with its peak of about 30% p.a. in the 1990s (JORGENSEN, 2001). It is not fully clear that the use of ICT - and hence the accumulation of ICT capital - contributes to higher productivity and output growth. From a theoretical perspective, however, one may state a broad range of arguments for such growthenhancing effects (WELFENS, 2003). This does, of course, not rule out that there could be considerable adjustment costs in the context of reorganization of firms with a rising share of ICT capital. It has been argued that a rising share of ICT equipment in the total capital stock raises the demand for skilled labor and reduces the demand for unskilled labor. With respect to Germany, a recent study (FALK/ KOEBEL; 2004) found that in the non-manufacturing sector there is some evidence for substitutability between office and computing machinery and unskilled workers. However in the manufacturing sector, this is not the case. By implication one can expect a relative fall of unskilled labor demand if the economy is moving towards a higher share of the service sector in the long run. However, one has to be careful with long run conclusions for a very simple reason. If ICT would contribute to higher long term growth, one may anticipate that the demand for personal services - ranging from gardening services to childcare - will rise in the long run so that the relative demand for unskilled labor will increase as full employment is almost being reached. Since the share of ICT in aggregate output had reached about 10% in such countries as the US and Germany in 2000 - which represents is a doubling compared to that seen in 1990 -, it is clear that ICT can hardly be a dominant driver of economic growth. However, expansion of ICT could contribute to an acceleration of growth for quite some time. To the extent that the expansion pace of ICT is different across countries, there could be considerable international differences in economic growth. Several countries in Europe and Asia - including Japan, Korea, Singapore and Malaysia - have strongly emphasized the opportunities of ICT and digital modernization. If mainly ICT production is the driver of digital growth one should expect only countries with considerable ICT output shares - in Europe above all Finland, Sweden, the Netherlands and the UK - to show an acceleration of growth. In Asia, mainly Japan and some Asean countries could expect strong benefits from ICT production. However, it is not fully clear whether screwdriver factories in some newly industrializing countries - concerning such countries as Malaysia in Asia or Poland in Europe - really generate high growth impulses for the respective countries. © Springer Berlin Heidelberg 2006.",
Rahman H.,ICT-based learning: A basic ingredient for socio-economic empowerment,2006,"ICT mediated learning provides utilities for achieving the goal of education for all, and in turn acts as an enabler in reducing the digital divide, reducing poverty, and promoting social inclusion. However, the integration of ICTs in education deserves considerable investment in time and resources. Consequently, during planning to integrate ICTs in evidence-based information for making sound decisions by the end users incorporate extensive research and sharing of critical information along different phases of planning. Furthermore, implementation of ICT based learning demands in depth analysis and intelligent feedback of the processes. Technology does not improve learning in a straight way and the fundamental question remains always unanswered, in assessing the effectiveness of ICTs or assessing the effectiveness of instructional treatments that were initially (and effectively) less than perfect. This chapter has tried to critically analyze the effective role of ICT methods in learning and put forwards several success cases of learning mechanisms that assisted in socioeconomic empowerment and at the same time, provided a few futuristic recommendations in establishing similar endeavors in promising economies. © 2007, Idea Group Inc.",
Park S.-J.,An analysis of R & D policy framework towards information society,2006,"The Information and communications technology (ICT), which described as a source for a new knowledge based society, has played an important role for building a foundation for future society. It has been providing variety of knowledge based information services and compatibility enhancements of Information Society. The government has promoted an expansion of the ICT supplying foundations with R&D investments for new society developments. Equipped with an independent supply of the technology, which is required on developing government policy, there have been tremendous efforts put into developments of the new industry and socio-economy through various demands for the Information and Telecommunication technology. Consequently, various technological advancements like the world best broadband Internet access and usage rate, and the first commercialized WiBro(Wireless Broadband Technology) and DMB(Digital Mobile Broadcasting Technology) will be set a high value as a world best level. These results have been feasible through the effective R&D policy and investments on technological development, which have been systematic and continuous driving forces. The research has suggested the political implications on interconnections among various policies; those are based on dependency of R&D policy in Information & Telecommunication, while building the information-society in Korea. Having identified the diverse characteristics of the R&D Policy from the history of Information & Telecommunication in Korea, the research has analyzed the framework of those R&D policies on building the information-society in terms of the institutional system and policy operation. The research proves that the R&D policy of supplying technologies for long-term period helps to achieve the construction and advancement of ICT industry, the efficient operation of Information & Telecommunication business and service, and the activation of information-utilization.

"Mueller M.L., Park Y., Lee J., Kim T.-Y.",Digital identity: How users value the attributes of online identifiers,2006,"This paper examines online identifiers from an economic perspective. It uses conjoint analysis survey techniques to develop empirical data on how users value the attributes of online identifiers. It is concerned in particular with three issues: (1) the degree to which identified subjects value increasing the scope of an identifier, i.e., the ability to use a single identifier to access services offered by several organizations; (2) the degree to which users' choice may be constrained by switching costs; and (3) the value individuals place on privacy and data security relative to other attributes such as cost or scope. The survey population was located in South Korea. The results indicate that e-mail addresses dominate the world of online identifiers for ordinary consumers; that consumers highly value increased scope (e.g., single sign-on capabilities) and the security of their private data; and that switching costs are high. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Currah A.,Hollywood versus the Internet: The media and entertainment industries in a digital and networked economy,2006,"The behaviour of oligopolistic firms is a source of considerable debate and concern, given their market power and ability to shape the development of new markets. A key area of debate concerns the scope for strategic adaptation in oligopolies; and in particular, the extent to which such large and otherwise successful firms ignore or marginalize important shifts in the marketplace. In this article, I critically evaluate these general theoretical issues through the lens of a specific, geographically bounded case study: the collision between Hollywood, a mature oligopoly comprising six studios, and the Internet, a decentralized architecture that has made possible peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing between networked computers. I argue that in a secure form (enforced by 'digital rights management' software), file sharing has considerable promise for all copyright owners, including the studios. I examine the oligopolistic behaviour of the studios in response to the Internet, and in particular, their response to an alternative mode of peer-based film distribution, oriented around legal, paid-for file sharing. I argue that the studios are trying to preserve the oligopolistic structure of the industry in a digital age by promoting an inefficient and restrictive 'design' for Internet distribution, oriented around centralized server-client architectures, which provides tight control over digital commodities and minimizes the disruptive impact of the Internet. This behaviour must be understood in light of the social and economic incentives that influence executives, as well as the context in which decision-making takes place. Nonetheless, their response also raises some worrying questions about the future shape of creativity, distribution and consumption in the film industry (and in the broader realm of media and entertainment) in a digital and networked economy.

Radiou N.,Does corporate R&D still matter?,2006,"The industrial R & D model which sustained firms' growth throughout the 20th century by exploring product innovations, is starting to crumble as new market forces expose its systemic inefficiencies and inadequacies. The western market largely biases anemic productivity rates, growing skills obsolesce and a shrinking local talent pool. In the present digital economy, it is harder to sustain global competitiveness through product innovations alone, because these are prone to replication. To drive synergies, R & D must actively combine technical and market insights across lines of businesses, and integrate with marketing and supply chain functions in order to speed time-to-market.

"Su C.-T., Chen Y.-H., Sha D.Y.",Linking innovative product development with customer knowledge: a data-mining approach,2006,"In today's digital economy, knowledge is regarded as an asset, and the implementation of knowledge management supports a company in developing innovative products and making critical management strategic decisions. Product innovation must link technological competence such as engineering and process know-how with knowledge about the customer, so that the product will meet the customers' needs, in order to secure market acceptance. Even though the importance of knowledge management in the technological innovation of a product has long been recognized, its potential for customer knowledge management has not been widely researched. To address the importance of the need of customer knowledge in innovative product development, this paper proposes an E-CKM model with a methodology for precisely delineating the process of customer knowledge management for innovative product development. In the knowledge management domain, an important task is the conversion of tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge, allowing information technology, such as web-based surveys and data mining to extract customer knowledge from different market segments. An empirical study applying the E-CKM model has been carried out, and it meets the evaluation criteria in a multiple-assessment scheme for showing a satisfactory result.

"Chen Y.-H., Su C.-T.",A Kano-CKM model for customer knowledge discovery,2006,"In the digital economy, knowledge is regarded as an asset in an organization, and knowledge management (KM) implementation supports a company in developing innovative products and making critical management strategic decisions for business excellence. Customer relationship management (CRM) is an information-technology-enabling management tool, which manages the relationship with customers to understand, target, and attract them, with the objective of satisfying and retaining customers. Their synergy potential draws attention in the academic community and has led to the emergence of the customer knowledge management (CKM) model. In a knowledge management domain, an important task is the conversion of tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge, whereby the well-established Kano's Method has come up to demand and extract customer knowledge for attractive quality creation in new product development projects. As a consequence, this study proposes a Kano-CKM model with a methodology to delineate precisely the process of customer knowledge discovery for innovative product development. An industry level market research project applying the Kano-CKM model has been accomplished to present a satisfactory justification and will be described in the case study part of this article.",Customer knowledge management; Customer relationship management; Kano's method; Market segmentation; Web-based survey
Kim J.,Infrastructure of the digital economy: Some empirical findings with the case of Korea,2006,"While different conceptions of the digital economy exist, there is a common ground where discussion on digital economy can be fostered. Taking the notion that digital economy as a continuum from the existing old economy, this paper regards the manufacturing sector of the digital equipment as the digital infrastructure. Upon this, this research attempts to analyze the supply and demand side development patterns of the infrastructure of the digital economy in Korea between 1989 and 2000 with the Bank of Korea's data in order to present the dynamic that brought the growth of digital economy. Research findings show that there has been an unique mechanism in the development of IT sector in Korea, while policy measures have been broadly identical to the promotion of other sectors. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

"Lai B., Brewer G.A.",New York City's broadband problem and the role of municipal government in promoting a private-sector solution,2006,"Broadband technology has made the world 'flat' so that anyone with a laptop computer can compete in the global economy. Many countries have implemented policies to quickly expand broadband penetration and adoption rates as well as encourage the development of higher-speed services. But the United States is falling behind, primarily due to the U.S. government's failure to implement policies that promote competition in the areas of affordable access and quality of service. The situation in New York City is a microcosm of this problem: most residents have only one or two service providers from which to choose, and many are unable to afford the service. It is recommended that the municipal government of New York City implement policies that facilitate competition in the broadband market so all residents, nonprofit organizations, and businesses have access to affordable broadband and other advanced communications technologies. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

"Ganley P., Allgrove B.",Net neutrality: A user's guide,2006,"Net neutrality is a complex issue that has generated intense levels of political discussion in the United States, but which has yet to attract significant attention from regulators in the UK. Nevertheless, the question of whether network operators should be prevented from blocking or prioritising certain network traffic or traffic from particular sources is a significant one for a wide range of stakeholders in the digital networked economy. Network operators contend that the build costs for the next generation of networks are so high that they must be permitted to monetise their control over this infrastructure as efficiently as possible. Meanwhile, an eclectic mix of interests including content and service providers, free speech and special interest groups and entertainers, argue that net neutrality regulation is necessary to guarantee that the Internet's core values and social utility are preserved. This article offers an introduction to net neutrality from a UK perspective. The authors explain the technical, commercial, political and legal considerations that underpin the issue and suggest that, whilst net neutrality regulation in its strongest incarnation is not practical or desirable, a level of regulatory action designed to enhance the choices of end users is the best way forward. © 2006 Baker; McKenzie LLP.",

Fu C.T.,A knowledge-based innovation for high technology industries and applying to cross strait marketplaces,2005,"The study discusses after China and Taiwan has finally cleared all the hurdles to gaining World Trade Organization (WTO) membership, joining in November 2001. However, foreign investors in China are increasingly embroiled in disputes with Chinese companies due to innovation barriers. Besides, after China and Taiwan joint WTO, high tech industrial competition faces globalization and digitalization two big problems Therefore, this paper examines the notion that China's and Taiwan's entry into the WTO and their innovation reforms in line with globalization and digitalization have a significant impact on the entire system of knowledge-based innovation management. Firstly, the study reviews innovation through a knowledge-based theory lens in the innovation supporting processes to construct a research framework. Internally, the supporting innovation processes include knowledge and technology innovation, Managing & organizing innovation. Externally, the supporting innovation processes include inter-organization networks, innovation networks and eknowledge networks and cooperation innovation. Secondly, the study through case studies critically investigates the supporting processes of innovation management in China and Taiwan in the context of their WTO entry, and puts forward exploratory ideas that may assist in creating a blueprint for deepening China's and Taiwan's innovation reforms. Under knowledge based and digital economy, how to overcome barriers of knowledge based innovation over the cross-strait and global markets are the most key factors for firm's survival. To answer these questions, in this paper, a more complete integrated innovation model and knowledge based innovation supply chain (KISC) for exploring and determining innovative supporting process in high tech industries and applying to cross strait (China and Taiwan) marketplace is presented.

"Yamori N., Nishigaki N.",Recent developments of digital cash projects in Japan,2005,"Most discussions and analyses regarding Japanese financial institutions during the 1990s have focused on the lingering effects of the collapse of the bubble economy, including huge non-performing loans and large-scale bank failures. Thus, it is natural for foreign observers to fail to acknowledge that many Japanese banks and other nonbank enterprises have conducted forward-looking projects despite their financial difficulties. One of these projects has been to develop digital cash technology and promote its usage. Because people in Japan tend to use cash for daily payments more often than people in other nations, if the Japanese begin using digital cash instead of traditional cash (i.e., Bank of Japan's notes and coins), we anticipate that digital cash will have a larger potential effect on the society and economy in Japan than in other nations. Efforts to establish digital cash projects made discernible progress in the early 2000s, and digital cash is more commonly used now in Japan than in other IT-advanced countries. This chapter attempts to provide an overview of the recent development of digital cash projects in Japan, and to discuss the issues involved in the further growth of digital cash usage. This chapter is organized as follows. Section 1 presents the introduction. In Section 2, we explain the historical developments of digital cash projects in Japan. Section 3 discusses what factors led to remarkable progress in digital cash usage in the early 2000s.

"Llerena P., Matt M., Trenti S.",Institutional arrangements of technology policy and management of diversity: The case of digital switching system in France and in Italy © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.,2005,"The importance of the development of a Digital Switching System (DSS) lies in its positive effect on the entire telecommunication network. DSS has provided greater reliability and speed, and enabled the introduction of new value added services, all of which have benefited the entire economic system. This chapter focuses on the development of DSS in France and Italy. We analyze how the 'organization' of a public research and development (R&D) programme can influence the relative success of a policy. By organization we mean coordination of the actors involved, and also the different technological options involved in innovation in telecommunications, which emerge, and should be publicly supported. Based on previous theoretical development, we state that the organization of a mission-oriented programme (such as the DSS) depends mainly on the learning ability of the policy maker and its proximity to the participating firms and institutions. Moreover, the management of technological diversity may have important impacts in terms of timing, costs, competition, technological diffusion and lock-in phenomena. The purpose of this chapter is to use this dynamic framework and evolutionary concepts to assess the relative success of the French and Italian DSS public programmes.To understand the importance of DSS development and, thus, the critical role of technology policy, we will briefly set it within the broader context of technological developments in telecommunication, i.e. the paradigm shift from electromechanical to digital technologies. Between the mid 1950s and the end of the 1980s, the telecommunication industry was at the centre of a technological revolution with the shift from the electromechanical to the digital paradigm. Electronic devices were gradually introduced in the three main sub-sectors of the telecommunication industry: transmission, switching and terminals. This chapter focuses essentially on the switching part of the network. The possibility of introducing electronics into the telecommunication network w as first conceived in the 1940s. But it was not until after the Second World War that the Bell Laboratories in the US and the research laboratory of the UK Post Office began to work on an electronic switching system. The discovery of the transistor by the Bell Laboratories in 1948, as a by-product of this research, was a fundamental step. However, it was over 20 years before a completely digital switching system was realized. The main problem was the reliability of the electronic components. In England, the first ambitious attempt in 1962 to introduce a totally electronic switching system failed. The research path followed by the US Bell Labs was more successful. Instead of being oriented towards a completely digital switching system. Bell Labs incrementally introduced new sophisticated devices in a traditional electromechanical switching system: the first prototype of a semi-electronic switch (ESS 1) was installed in 1965. To understand the technological choices made by Italy and France it is worth describin briefly the two main trajectories within the digital paradigm: the space division and the time division trajectories. A space division switching system is characterized by a physical connection between the entry and the exit of the signal. It is thus possible to follow the path of the signal through the space by the means of contacts that are generally electromechanical, but may also be electronic. This was the technological option adopted by the US and Germany. In a time division DSS the signal is ""translated"" into a digital code and then transmitted through purely electronic devices. In France and in Italy, time division was the preferred trajectory, but was arrived at by different routes (Libois 1983). The aim of this chapter is to compare the technological developments in France and Italy. The evolution of the technology related to the introduction of digital switching had various consequences for both the service provider and the manufacturer. For the telecommunication service provider, the technologi c l shift meant, first of all, a reduction in costs: these were the result of overall size, maintenance and numbers of personnel employed on installed lines. This shift allowed improvements in the capacity of the switching systems and offered greater reliability and improved quality Finally, it opened up the opportunity for the introduction of new services and offered the possibility for digitized transmission of data and images in addition to voice (i.e., an ISDN-Integrated Services Digital Network). For the service providers it can be claimed that: ""the advantages of electronic systems towards electromechanical ones undoubtedly exceed the risks connected to the management and organization of the technological conversion and the costs connected to the qualification of the personnel"" (Bragho 1988). For the manufacturing firms, this technological evolution meant a shift fi-om a labour intensive technology (electromechanical) to a competence intensive one (digital). This shift involved a change in the number nd type of people employed, the need for them to accumulate new competencies, and increased economies of scales, especially in R&D (Zanfei 1990). The progression from the electromechanical to the electronic paradigm involved a radical process of restructuring of the workforce, an increase in fixed capital investment, and the introduction of new flexible production technologies. Moreover, manufacturing firms were forced to accumulate upstream competencies in new and different fields, such as microelectronics and software, in order to develop and incrementally improve new products. Finally, the economies of scales in R&D increased. R&D investments need to be high in terms of the minimum efficient threshold, and they tend to remain high throughout the entire product life cycle, which eventually becomes shorter. Thus, it can be seen that technology policies have a tremendous impact on the fiirther development not only of an industry-in this case telecommunication-but also of the whole economy. The two cases described in this chapter are the development of the ElO in France and the Proteo/UT family in Italy. The time period spans the 1950s to the 1980s for France, and the 1960s to the end of the 1980s for Italy. Based both on theoretical hypothesis and on empirical facts, we show that the relative success of the efforts in France can be explained by the ability of policy makers to appropriately coordinate the actors in the telecommunication innovation system, and the various technological options. However, political decisions related to competition entailed some failures, such as the demise of one national company. The Italian R&D programme, on the other hand, suffered from a lack of coordination between the actors involved. After a long period of experimentation, national resources were finally pooled and Italian firms cooperated with foreign companies. The delay in this collaboration induced high costs and significant delays in the development of the technology, thus explaining its relative lesser success, comp red to France. The first part of the chapter focuses on the institutional set up of the telecommunication systems in each country. The analysis mainly compares the characteristics of the two information structures and highlights the coordination mechanisms used to develop the DSS. The specific institutional arrangements had some consequences for the dynamics of DSS diffusion. We then go on to analyze the policies in terms of coordination failures, diversity exploitation, and lock-in and diffusion effects. This allows us to assess the relative success of each country's policies. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.",
Filos E.,Virtuality and the future of organizations,2005,"This chapter aims at drawing a picture of how organizations are likely to develop in the context of ""virtuality,"" i.e., following the impact of technologies relevant to the information society. Organizations will expand their traditional boundaries to form new organizational patterns that will allow them to adapt to the changing environment of the information society as well as to exploit the opportunities of a digital economy. The chapter, therefore, shows how research, in particular research that was supported under the European Commission's R&D programs, has played a significant role in shaping these developments. The research aimed at developing the underpinning information and communication technologies as well as at understanding the business processes and the socioeconomic impact of virtual organizations. Although many of the features of this new organizational paradigm are still not fully understood, there is hope that organizations in the future will be smart in various respects and will develop in a way that maximizes the leveraging of knowledge and innovation. © 2005, Idea Group Inc.",
"Llerena P., Matt M.",Innovation policy in a knowledge-based economy: Theory and practice,2005,"The main underlining conviction, throughout the book, is the importance of dynamical and systemic approaches to innovation policies. The first part of the book provides the theoretical background for the subsequent more empirical contributions. In the second part, a series of three papers analyse each the development or diffusion of a specific technology developed in the frame of a procurement policy. They explain the success of mission-oriented policies (the development of digital switching systems in the telecom sector, the development of high-speed trains in Germany and the diffusion of military technologies). The three papers contained in the third part explore the impact of incentive tools (R&D tax credits, R&D cooperative agreements and university-industry relations) on the innovation potentialities of firms and of economic systems (regions). The chapters in the last part of the book are all based around the question of how is it possible to design an innovation policy, applicable throughout Europe, bearing in mind the diversity of innovation behaviours and strategies. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.",
Hughes K.H.,Facing the global competitiveness challenge,2005,"The key to the economic growth and prosperity of the United States is due to a renewed and systematic focus on innovation, which helps the nation to meet economic challenges effectively. The spread of Internet and digital revolution have combined to introduce international competition to a range of service occupations that were previously prevented from overseas rivals. New competitors in Aia and the old Soviet sphere and old rivals in Europe and Japan are taking effective measures in adapting the US model of innovation to their own economic institutions and traditions. Driven in part by a fear that Japan was becoming the world's major industrial power, government and private sectors worked together to forge changes that made the US the world's dominant economy. A public-sector focus and a more productive private sector also helped the nation to meet the difficulties of the 21st century that included financial collapse, the tragic attacks of 9/11, and a series of corporate scandals.",

Factors positively affecting the dynamics of IST involve investment in R&D and physical capital, a European regulatory framework favouring competition and liberalisation (for tele-communications, infrastructures, networks and services) and an appropriate endowment of human capital (literacy, education, skills of experts and of end users). Among the EU15, seven countries were identified as paradigmatic (they account for 2/3 of EU15 activity), and termed innovators (Finland, Ireland), advanced (UK, France, Germany) and laggards (Italy, Portugal). Three scenarios are outlined until 2010 (business-as-usual, negative and positive). The Finnish paradigm can be termed a policy prescription; 32 polytechnics for 5 million people and a policy of investing in R&D were the drivers.

Lange B.,Sociospatial strategies of culturepreneurs. The example of Berlin and its new professional scenes,2005,"One of the key urban and cultural developments in post-reunification Berlin has been the emergence of new hybrid cultural as well as entrepreneurial agents, the so-called culturepreneurs. Germany's new capital has been suffering under continuous socioeconomic crises for the last six to eight years. In this situation, the catchword of a new entrepreneurship alludes to individualised marketing strategies and social hardships, but also to skilful alternation between unemployment benefit, temporary project based jobs and selfemployment structures as practiced by numerous young agents in the field of cultural production. Semantically supported since 1998 by terms like Generation Berlin, new entrepreneurial trajectories and professional careers in the field of popular culture, the production of symbolic goods, and the new digital media oriented economy of Berlin can be analysed from an individual perspective. Declining financial support from the government forced many cultural activists and artists to open their professional practices towards corporate firms, new forms of project based cooperation as well as specific spatial practices in order to economically, culturally and socially sustain on the targeted market. Based on qualitative empirical research, the interpretation of these spatial strategies offers insights into new models of urbanity shaped by design-intensive professional group members and their associated locally based scenes in the fragmented and moving city of Berlin.",
"Houldsworth E., Alexander G.",Inter-organisational collaboration for the digital economy,2005,"Purpose - This paper was intended to explore the concept of learning in networks using recent literature from this emerging field. In order to do so, it takes as a case study a pan-European e-learning project, which required collaborative working and learning within a distributed team. Design/methodology/approach - The approach has been qualitative and exploratory. Data have been collected via interviews with project partners and participant observation of the steering group meetings. Analysis has similarly been qualitative in nature. Findings - Analysis suggests that there are links with earlier literature on inter-organisational learning networks, particularly around culture, management style and leadership in virtual collaboration. Interestingly, even supposed ""experts"" in the field of e-learning technologies showed a preference to work face-to-face. Research limitations/implications - The research to date has been exploratory and small-scale. More work is required to test the findings in a wider context. Practical implications - The findings are believed to have considerable practical value, both for the European Union, as the funding body, but also for one's own practice, and that of others as they attempt to facilitate learning and collaborating in networks.

"Papagiannidis S., Li F.",Skills brokerage: A new model for business start-ups in the networked economy,2005,"This paper presents a new business model based on skill brokerage, aiming to facilitate business start-ups and enhance their chance of survival in the context of the networked economy. The model is based on the concept of an entrepreneur sharing the venture's returns or even ownership with a skills broker in exchange for skills. This exchange can significantly reduce barriers in network-oriented and information-driven markets, where skills are of critical importance. It can also significantly alleviate cash flow problems, typical of many new start ups and a main cause of business failure. The model is particularly relevant to information-intensive ventures, where the value of a service is often significantly higher than the actual cost incurred by the skills providers in providing the service. If the model can be made to work, it can not only significantly increase the number of business start-ups, but also enhances their chances of survival. In this paper, we will illustrate this new business model, by providing three case studies, and explore its implications for theory, practice and policy. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Our premise is that this may be more so in less developed economies where incubators can help bridge knowledge, digital, socio-political and even cultural divides and help increase the availability, awareness, accessibility and affordability of financial, human, intellectual, and even social capital, the key ingredients of entrepreneurial success. Incubation has recently experienced increased attention as a model of start-up facilitation. Venture capitalists see incubators as a means to diversify risky investment portfolios, while would-be entrepreneurs approach incubators for start-up support. Incubators are faced with the challenge and the opportunity of managing both investment risks, as well as entrepreneurial risks. As an indication of their usefulness, more than a thousand incubators have been established in the last few years based on a number of different incubation business models (not-for-profit, for-profit, public/private entity, etc.), which we categorize in five incubator archetypes: the university incubator, the independent commercial incubator, the regional business incubator, the company-internal incubator, and the virtual incubator. In this paper, we propose an overarching incubator model that synthesizes elements and best practices emanating from the five archetypes empirically identified and also incorporates substantially higher economies of scale and scope, as well as global and local (gloCal) knowledge arbitrage potential. This paper presents an architectural blueprint for designing a gloCal, real and virtual network of incubators (G-RVIN) as a knowledge and innovation infra-structure and infra-technology which would link entrepreneurs and micro-entrepreneurs with local, regional, and global networks of customers, suppliers and complementors and thus help not only bridge, but also leverage, the diverse divides (digital, knowledge, cultural, socio-political, etc.). The implications of this archetype of new ventures incubation for facilitating both venture business activity and broad-based economic development are discussed and early findings from pilot projects in central and eastern Europe are discussed. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The embroidery factories could enjoy the economies of scale, and further reduction in prices could further push up the demand for embroidery production. Other manufacturing companies such as thread manufacturers and laser-cutter machine manufacturers have also grown in China. There will also be an emphasis of embroidery factories on economic efficiency instead of the blind pursuance of the productivity without profits.

The model, which includes agents that borrow and lend and a competitive credit industry, and which has endogenous default and credit limits, allows us to explore the extent to which aggregate events are amplified or smoothed via the mechanism of household bankruptcy filings. In the model agents are subject to shocks to earnings opportunities, to preferences, and to their asset position and borrow and lend to smooth consumption. On occasion, the realization of the shocks is bad enough so that agents take advantage of the opportunities provided by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and file for bankruptcy, which wipes out their debt at the expense both of being banned from borrowing for a certain amount of time and of incurring transaction costs. The incentives to default are time-varying and depend on the individual state and general economic conditions. The model is quantitative in the sense that its fundamental parameters are estimated using U.S. data, and the model can replicate the aggregate conditions of the U.S. economy. Especially, the model accounts for the very high number of bankruptcies in the past few years. We report statistics produced by experiments with model economies with various aggregate shocks. Based on these experiments, we analyze the reaction of households to various aggregate real shocks and the interaction between households and the credit industry, and we discuss the aggregate implications of these actions and the direction in which the model might be further extended. © Cambridge University Press 2005.",
Parayil G.,The digital divide and increasing returns: Contradictions of informational capitalism,2005,"The far-reaching advances in information and communications technologies (ICTs) in tandem with the globalization of trade, investment, business regulation, production, and consumption have signaled the rise of ""informational capitalism."" This article reflects on the social and economic inequalities of informational capitalism by examining two contradictions of ICTs-led economic development-increasing returns and the digital divide. Two main and interrelated strands of evidence are presented: First, contrary to expectations that rising income per capita will tend to reduce wealth and wage disparities, the distribution of income and wealth both between countries and individuals has sharply skewed in the information age; second, knowledge production is a self-reinforcing cycle that tends to disproportionately reward some and exclude others. The so-called digital divide is as much a symptom and a cause of these broader techno-economic phenomena, and regarding it as a simple issue of connectivity is simplistic and reductive.",Digital divide; Globalization; Income inequality; Increasing returns; Informational capitalism; International division of labor; Knowledge economy
"Wareham J., Mathiassen L., Rai A., Straub D., Klein R.",The business value of digital supply networks: A program of research on the impacts of globalization,2005,"The ""Networked Economy"" describes alliances of firms that manage globally distributed supply networks. In the best of all worlds, this interactive flow of information among member firms will result in efficient and effective balance of supply and demand. Unfortunately, supply networks suffer from poor and inexact information, and, in the worst case, information is unavailable where and when it is needed. Such entropy creates errors and limits responsiveness of processes leading to situations where there is too much or too little inventory at a given stage in a supply network. These complications are exacerbated across transnational supply chain networks. This paper offers theoretical perspectives, a case study, and outline of a research proposal to help address these challenges and develop insights into the best practices of transnational digital supply networks. High level questions include: What are the defining characteristics of high performing digital supply networks? How does information sharing impact the error and responsiveness of supply network processes and, consequently, supply network performance? How do international outsourcing practices affect network outcomes? These questions are theoretically examined and used to formulate specific hypotheses. An initial investigation of this theoretical formulation is conducted using a case study approach of a global plastics supply network. We propose a program of follow-up empirical work based on a broad field study of high performing supply networks. After a rigorous process for developing the instrumentation through semi-structured interviews, we expect to gather information about over 300 network configurations. As initial empirical evidence for going beyond dyadic exploration of supply networks, we present a case analysis of a plastic industry supply network, the Omnexus electronic trading network. In this analysis, we show how network externalities lead to more efficient flows of information and to more dynamic responses. The overall performance of all firms participating in this network should be enhanced over time. The major contribution of these ongoing studies will be new theoretical and empirical insights into the pathologies and metabolism of global digital supply networks. Specifically, we intend to delineate externalities of supply networks that are not embraced by exclusively dyadic perspectives, as well as the salient factors that complicate the interaction of supply network behavior across national boundaries. We will develop, test and measure novel constructs such as networked organizational performance and error amplification, unveiling systematic knowledge about the relationships between these factors across socio-geographic regions. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

In no country is the debate between the optimists and the pessimists more relevant than in India, where new centers of information technology are creating wealth and integrating some sectors into the global economy, while millions remain marginalized and deprived of the most basic human needs. On the other side of the digital divide are the 45 percent of the population who cannot read or write (57 percent of the female population), the 44 percent who survive on less than $1 per day, and those who live in the 370,000 villages that do not have telephone connections. Noting the irony of such sharp contrasts, the former President of India, Narayan lamented in a speech on the eve of the country's fiftieth anniversary as a republic that India has one of the world's largest reservoirs of trained technical personnel but also one of the world's largest number of illiterates, the largest number of people below the poverty line, and the largest number of children suffering from malnutrition. The fact remains that no developing country has benefited more from the digital revolution than India, and in no country is the digital divide wider or deeper. In the words of Bill Gates in which recently he pointed out, what good a computer is for someone who survives on 1$ per day, whose main concern is the next meal. It is a fact that in India the impact of information technology has not reached every sphere of activity or every individual yet India has made a good deal of contribution in this field and has risen to considerable eminence in the world. Information Technology has created a new and dynamic economic sector, generating significant employment and wealth. It is therefore necessary to see how we can bridge this divide that is shaping between the digitally rich and the digitally poor nations, institutions and individuals. The essential nature of the development process is the progressive development of social organizations and institutions that harness and direct the society's energies and material resources for higher levels of accomplishment. © 2005, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",
Al-Qaimari G.,Web globalization: A methodology for developing usable websites for the global market,2005,"In today's global economy, with the appearance of the Internet and the fast evolution of technology, the frontiers of local markets have been fading and blending with global markets. These markets with no boundaries have lead many companies, organizations, educational institutions, and digital libraries to develop their own websites, and to find ways to make them usable and accessible and their products saleable to customers outside their traditional markets. Going global can help corporations lower the cost of entry to international trade, increase sales, create global demands, and establish a reliable, professional and international image online. This means that website development methodologies must be modified to truthfully reflect and accommodate the needs of a global design. This research work contributes to the study of this complex and challenging issue by proposing a practical and user-centred global website development lifecycle (Global-WDLC) that supports internationalization and localization.",Globalization; Internationalisation; Local usability; Localization; Universal usability; User-centred web development

Elsner W.,"The ""new"" economy: Complexity, coordination and a hybrid governance approach",2004,"The paper starts from the increasing spatial and functional fragmentation of value-added chains, global de-regulation and dis-embedding of ""markets"", and interdependencies among the Net-based digital technologies. It develops a socio-economic setting with ubiquitous direct interdependencies and interactions, Net-externalities, ""strategic"" strong uncertainty, and omnipresent collective-good and social-dilemma problems. These entail co-ordination failures, either in the form of conventional market failure (i.e. collective blockages of action) or of ""wrong"" or outmoded institutional co-ordination and, thus, wide-spread technological ""lock-ins"" that are indicative of insufficient ability of collective action. This is particularly true for de-regulated, individualistic cultures. In contrast, sustainable innovation, used in a broad, i.e. technological and institutional, sense, requires an effective collective action competence. This, in turn, requires a new and increased co-ordination. Against this background, the global corporate economy has spontaneously developed private individualist substitute arrangements to cope with the new complexity, such as local clusters and hub-and-spoke networks, which all have severe shortcomings. With reference to what we call the ""Linux"" paradigm, the paper discusses the possibility of a spontaneous evolutionary, i.e. collectively learned, institutional co-ordination through emergent collective action and networks with ""good"" governance. The paper argues that only a hybrid system that consists of ""well-governed"" networks and a new approach towards more comprehensive and deliberate ""interactive"" and "" institutional"" public policy, supporting collective learning and emergent institutional co-ordination, is capable of solving the complexity and co-ordination problems of the ""new"" economy by increasing certainty, stability and more continuous and comprehensive innovation. This new policy approach is outlined at the end. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Communication technologies; Governance; Market economy; Social economics
"Cook D.A., Wang W.",Neutralizing the piracy of motion pictures: Reengineering the industry's supply chain,2004,"Faced with the challenge of distributing digital product in the digital realm, the American film industry is acutely aware of its increasing vulnerability to piracy and is currently considering two solutions to protect its copyrights-a legislative solution (e.g., the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998) and a technical solution (e.g., digital watermarking). We suggest that a better way of dealing with piracy is an economic solution, such as neutralizing piracy by reengineering the supply chain across all three sectors of the motion picture industry: distribution, exhibition, production. In distribution, the industry can make legitimate downloading of high-quality movie files easier and cheaper (than pirating) by strategically locating ""e-Blockbusters"" (i.e., digital movie libraries) at or near Internet service provider (ISP) sites and making them attractive through feasible pricing schemes. In exhibition, innovative digital theaters could offer virtual reality viewing experiences and flexible windowing systems that maximize revenue for each feature film. In production, work would be done primarily or entirely in the digital domain. Digital film reservoirs would provide universal naming and indexing functions for easy access, reuse, and extension, and the industry would achieve a new diversity of quality and quantity. In addition, dynamic cross-media convergence can be expected as a function of the complementarities created by content digitization. To prosper in the new digital economy, the motion picture industry must closely collaborate with the information industry to achieve a new supply chain rather than competing with it to the detriment of both. © 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",Digital rights management; Motion pictures; Piracy

"Berkhout F., Hertin J.",De-materialising and re-materialising: Digital technologies and the environment,2004,"Drawing on recent literature on the environmental impact of information and communication technologies (ICTs) and the Internet, this paper identifies three main types of effects: direct impacts of the production and use of ICTs on the environment (resource use and pollution related to the production of infrastructure and devices, electricity consumption of hardware, electronic waste disposal); indirect impacts related to the effect of ICTs on production processes, products and distribution systems (de-materialisation, substitution of information goods for material goods, and substitution of communication at a distance for travel); and structural/behavioural impacts, mainly through the stimulation of structural change and growth in the economy by ICTs, and through impacts on life styles and value systems. This paper argues that the diffusion and use of ICTs are leading to both positive and negative environmental impacts. However, because the effects of ICTs on economic activity are pervasive, their impacts on the environment are difficult to trace and measure. The paper argues for a need to move beyond the dichotomy between pessimism and optimism demonstrated in much of the emerging literature. Instead the relationship must be recognised as complex, interdependent, deeply uncertain and scale-dependent. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

"Budd L., Harris L.",E-economy: Rhetoric or business reality?,2004,"As dot.com became dot.bomb, the hype that surrounded the meteoric growth of the network economy has given way to realism, or even scepticism, about the potential of ICT as a source of new business models. It is now appropriate to reflect critically on the e-economy hype, and to use this as a way of looking forward to new, more realistic possibilities. Using a business and socio-economic framework, this book investigates a range of challenges for restructuring the e-economy. This framework includes operations management, human resource management, e-learning, e-retailing, e-marketing, e-government, enterprise culture and digital divide. Divided into four themes (the changing business environment, knowledge management, learning in the public domain and e-business practices within and between organizations), each chapter considers the international context and critically explores a key aspect of the e-economy. Rigorous yet still retaining the accessible format which distinguishes all the volumes in this series, this book provides a thorough critique of the prospects facing businesses in the new economy and will be of interest to anyone studying e-business/commerce. © 2004 selection and editorial matter, Leslie Budd and Lisa Harris; individual chapters, the contributors.

Carlsson B.,The Digital Economy: What is new and what is not?,2004,"There are many signs indicating that something new has happened in the United States economy during the last decade. While the surge in labor and total factor productivity growth rates in the latter half of the 1990s was impressive and widely interpreted as a sign of a 'New Economy,' it remains to be seen whether it was a fleeting phenomenon or the beginning of a new trend. But there are other indicators that are less cyclical in nature and that appear more likely to persist.In this paper, I argue that the observed changes are at least consistent with the view that digitization of information, combined with the Internet, represents a form of general-purpose technology that is giving rise to a vast new array of possible combinations that we may refer to as the New Economy. The level of connectivity between actors and ideas is increasing dramatically. We have only begun to see the impact, and only part of it is measurable.Interpreted in this way, the New or Digital Economy is about dynamics, not static efficiency. It is more about new activities and products than about higher productivity. What is really new in the New Economy is the proliferation of the use of the Internet, a new level and form of connectivity among multiple heterogeneous ideas and actors, giving rise to a vast new range of combinations. There are some measurable effects on productivity and efficiency, but the more important long-run effects are beyond measurement. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The paper is based on a survey of a sample of European exchanges located in Italy. Alternative business models are described through a cluster analysis along with three dimensions: content, structure, and governance. By comparing performances of the alternative business models, the analysis is able to show key features of successful business models for B-to-B e-marketplaces.The findings show that private large exchanges have a superior capability to generate turnover compared to vertical niche operators, due to specific choices of content, structure, and governance.

"Ayres R.U., Williams E.",The digital economy: Where do we stand?,2004,"The rapid transition towards a ""digital economy"" was enabled by a converging set of innovations. Computing saw the development of the semiconductor transistor, integrated circuit, personal computers (PCs), operating systems, and graphical interfaces. The physical layer of telecommunication was enabled via the emergence of optical fiber and new wireless communication technologies, while networking saw the development of the Internet (essentially packet switching) and the World Wide Web. These advances combined to realize a series of new applications of information and communications technologies (ICTs) such as business software, e-mail, and e-commerce. However, progress seriously stumbled with the collapse of the dot com bubble, which among other things revealed a huge amount of misdirected investment that could have been used more productively. The question of the day is thus how to realize new ""killer apps"" to stimulate a new round of growth. The use of cell phones for communicating text, pictures, and video is a rapidly expanding area, but it seems unlikely that these applications will have a macroeconomic impact. Entertainment is a key industry whose fortunes are entwined with ICTs. Indeed, the application of ICT to innovating entertainment products is an important driver for the continued growth of the industry. Distribution of music and video via the Web could significantly stimulate demand but also raises the thorny question of how to protect intellectual property rights (IPR) of content providers. Another possible killer apps are interactive video-on-demand and telecalls/teleconferencing. The latter would, among other things, stimulate adoption of telework. The current Internet is capable of handing neither one-way transmissions of high-quality video nor interactive video-on-demand. There are bottlenecks both for the ""last mile"" connection from Internet service provider (ISP) to the home but also the ""first miles"" from originating server to ISP. The effective first miles bandwidth has not increased along with improvements in equipment, essentially because demand increases with capacity and thus traffic jams on the net continue. Digital subscriber line (DSL) technologies over telephone wires, and possibly wireless networks, will play important roles in getting over the last mile hurdle. Upgrading the first miles will probably require new networking protocols beyond TCP/IP that support multimedia and also changes in the economic model of information transfer via the Net. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Fjermestad J.,An analysis of communication mode in group support systems research,2004,"Group support systems (GSS) have been the subject of many investigations and meta-analyses over the past decade. This study presents, summarizes, and analyzes the results of 145 experiments that used communication mode as an independent variable. The results show that the modal outcome for GSSs compared to Face-to-Face (FtF) methods is ""no difference,"" while the overall percentage of positive effects for results that compare GSS to FtF is 29.2%. The results suggest that the use of a GSS improves decision quality, depth of analysis, equality of participation, and satisfaction over manual methods. Additionally, more detailed analysis suggests that task type, GSS type and the interaction of both have a moderating effect on adaptation and outcome factors. Specifically, groups working on idea generation tasks using GSS decision room technology improve to 39.6% (GSS>FtF) effect. Conversely, asynchronous computer-mediated communication (CMC) groups working on decision making tasks improved to 46.4% (GSS>FtF) effect. FtF groups show higher levels of consensus and perceived quality, communicate more, and are more efficient (requiring less time to complete the tasks).

The goal was to define the characteristics of a vital and robust sector, and to help develop an actionable leadership framework. The ultimate goal of the ""Electricity Sector Framework for the Future"" project is to establish a coherent set of actions and accountabilities that will enable the electricity sector to meet the escalating needs and aspirations of its customers, investors/owners, and society. In order to be effective, such a set of actions must reflect mutual self-interest and equity across the broad electricity stakeholder community. In general, this requires a unified industry leadership commitment that electricity, through innovative technology, has a service value greater than its traditional basic commodity value. This vision of innovative opportunities to transform the reliability and value of electricity for the future must be ""sold"" to the public and public policy leaders at the local, state, and federal levels who can credibly advocate the message. Additionally, the initiative must be expanded to educate stakeholders about mechanisms for strengthening industry credibility, building trust, and gaining broad public and political support for the sector's vision and needed actions. Finally, the costs and benefits must be made tangible, compelling, and urgent for all stakeholders, especially consumers. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

However, fraud and misrepresentation have led to widespread skepticism and distrust of electronic communities. We develop an evolutionary model to explore the issue of trust within an electronic community from a dynamic process perspective. This model emphasizes large populations, continuous change in community memberships, and imperfect information and memory. As the term trust is often used in the context of individual interaction, at a group level we propose using the term health to measure the sustained competitive advantages of honest members over cheaters throughout the evolution of a community. We find conditions under which an electronic community is healthy and attracts outside population. We find that many factors, such as information dissemination speed, honest players' payoffs and possible losses, new community members' initial trust status, and the replacement rate of community members, all affect the health of an electronic community, and that some of them also affect a community's size. We then discuss the implications of our research for e-community practices. © 2005 M.E.

Their results, based on an analysis of 13,720 price quotes, show that when posted prices are considered, traditional retailers have the highest prices, followed by multichannel retailers, and pure-play e-tailers, in that order. However, when shipping costs are included, multichannel retailers have the highest prices, followed by pure-play e-tailers and traditional retailers, in that order. With regard to price dispersion, pure-play e-tailers have the highest range of prices, but the lowest standard deviation. Multichannel retailers have the highest standard deviation in prices with or without shipping costs.

"Zwick D., Dholakia N.",Whose Identity Is It Anyway? Consumer Representation in the Age of Database Marketing,2004,"In the information-intensive marketplaces of the networked economy, database-related marketing techniques have gained unprecedented popularity. Their development is based on the assumption that greater capturing of customer information in digital databases leads to epistemologically superior insights about the customer. The proliferation of customer databases, however, has triggered privacy concerns and has encouraged consumers to devise information externalization strategies to maintain control over their digital representation (identity) vis-à-vis companies. Drawing on poststructuralist theory, the authors argue that current consumer strategies are ineffective in maintaining control over one's identity in the electronic marketplace because such strategies are based on an obsolete ontological distinction between material identity and digital representation. They suggest that in the age of database marketing, digital consumer representations in fact constitute the consumer. Therefore, only if consumers are given full access to companies’ customer databases can they maintain a sense of control over their identities in the marketplace. © 2004, SAGE Publications.

It shows that Italy's position on the European scene is below average, though with ample room for improvement. The benefits that the new technology is potentially capable of bringing to the economy are certainly great both in terms of cost reductions and in terms of development of new goods and services and the expansion of markets. The factors impeding the development and spread of ICT consist in the small size of Italian firms and their pronounced sectoral specialization, often linked historically to low-tech activities. In many cases the services offered by technology suppliers are not well calibrated to the needs of the Italian economy or Italian industry. A systemic approach to the problems of digital innovation is needed. Investment in knowledge and R&D is crucial. Government, together with business, plays a decisive role in the technological evolution of society. This is the direction aimed at by the numerous political initiatives (tax reductions, incentives, training, infrastructure) undertaken at both national and European level. Accordingly, the article evaluates the current state of digital penetration and innovation and discusses the prospects for the development of ICT in Italy in light of the policies and strategies adopted at both national and European level to encourage the spread of the new technologies.",
Boyer R.,The future of economic growth: As new becomes old,2004,"'How significant was the internet boom and bust? Robert Boyer brings significant and fresh insight to efforts to situate the meaning of the digital transformation through which we are living. With analytic discipline and historical perspective, Boyer provides an important interpretation that will be valuable to scholar and teacher, those just curious about the internet development and those who lived through it.' - John Zysman, University of California, Berkeley, US. In this book, Robert Boyer follows the origins, course and collapse of the 'new economy' and proposes a new interpretation of US dynamism during the 1990s. He argues that the diffusion of information and communication technologies is only part of a story that also requires understanding of the transformation of the financial system, the reorganization of the management of firms and the emergence of a new policy mix. The book includes a long-term retrospective analysis of technological innovation, and an international comparison of OECD countries delivers an unconventional and critical assessment of the hope and the hype of the 'new economy'. © The Saint-Gobain Centre for Economic Studies 2004.

"van Loenen B., Onsrud H.J.",Geographic data for academic research: Assessing access policies,2004,"Data availability is a key issue affecting the collective well-being of society. Economic and legal scholars have argued that the current, relatively open, access-to-data environment in the United States is beneficial to advancing knowledge and the economy. However, little empirical evidence exists to validate the extent to which various access policy environments do or do not contribute to the productivity of academic researchers. Our research aimed to evidence support or lack of support of various data policies in the context of access to, and use of, geographic data within the university research environment. We synthesized a set of twenty-three recommended access-to-data principles from recommendations set forth in the literature. An online questionnaire strove to gain sufficient information to determine whether recommended principles were adhered to in the acquisition of each specific data set and whether scientists were productive in their use of such data sets. Productivity was assessed in terms of five measures. We hypothesized that data-sharing relationships would be more productive for science if the data policies confronted by scientists in their use of digital geographic data conformed with the recommended policies advocated in the literature. The data indicated relatively clear statistical significance in testing the principles of ""adherence to pricing at marginal cost or less"" and ""provision for availability of metadata."" Correlated with the productivity of scientists, the collected survey data evidenced non-support of the first principle and support of the second. The latter finding suggests that government, private sector, and academic suppliers of geographic data should give high priority to the documentation of metadata in order to stimulate the more widespread use of available spatial data. This article describes the survey and statistical methods employed in researching this problem and presents the results of testing the two recommended principles. The implications of the findings are discussed.",Chi square test; Cost recovery; Data access principles; Geographic data; GIS; Measures of success; Meta-data; Open access; Productivity; T-test

"Kamel S., Ibrahim M.",Electronic Training at the Corporate Level in Egypt: Applicability and Effectiveness,2003,"Declining revenue, staff downsizing and limited resources in corporations create serious organizational challenges. Training and human resources departments are often among the most adversely affected. Training managers are left with fewer resources with which to fulfil corporate training needs. Continuously having to justify costs and investments in training, they are often asked about the applicability and effectiveness of a particular project. Electronic training, a strategic human resource investment vehicle, is increasingly called into question in this context. But electronic training is expected to become a crucial factor in meeting the challenges of the rapidly changing world economy and enabling organizations to adapt to continuous change. While electronic training poses considerable challenges for organizations, especially in developing countries, it may also represent a unique opportunity to close the digital divide between developed and developing nations and to advance economic development. This paper is based on research conducted in Egypt to investigate the effectiveness and applicability of electronic training in Egyptian organizations and to identify how those organizations assess the role and implementation of electronic training. The researchers solicited views from training and human resources managers, instructors and trainees themselves. © 2003, © 2003 SAGE Publications.",distance learning; Egypt; electronic training; information technology; online education
"Srinivasan N.S., Balasubramanian G.",Strategic Thinking: A Neuronal Architectural View,2003,"The customer-centric digital economy needs business leaders and strategic thinkers to develop a new skill-set of delving within the deeper regions of consciousness and precognize the evolving future in order to make critical decisions that will set the future direction of the organization. As change accelerates to a never before recorded level, sustaining the precognitive capability of collective intelligence of the organization is fast becoming a pre-requisite for survival in the context of hyper-competition. This capacity has to be learnt, understood, and successfully internalized in every strategic thinker. In a business environment where executive functions and passion- driven processes are given greater attention, the precognitive capability gradually begins to wane as either the need for catering to existing demand or anticipation for rewards or both become predominant drivers. This silent change is very slow, hidden, and is not noticed until strategic decisions begin to miscarry. Most of the time, the person's general behaviour could still be in confirmation with the culture of the organization, yet it is possible to identify minor anomalies that occur with a better understanding of how the neuronal circuitry is built in the brain and the underpinning motivational drivers that incite their change. New scientific evidence in the field of Cognitive Science gives us some pointers into hitherto enigmatic queries. The latest research in this field shows that it is possible today to decide on an individual's capability to deliver future results not merely based on past achievements but on his continuing ability to change based on underpinning motivational drivers. This paper presents a neuronal architectural framework to evaluate the future potential of a top management performer based on scientific evidence rather than depend on either the past performances or probability of future success without considering the individual's ability to align with the organizational bionetwork. The paper also addresses every CEO's cup of woe – motivating people to change and ensuring constant growth. Corporate training has to address the following three dilemmas: overcoming the problem of habituation activating the Supervisory Attentional System (SAS) ensuring that inputs given to each individual possess the appropriate degree of novelty and complexity. © 2003, © 2003 SAGE Publications.",Bottom-up/Top-down Processing; Brain Re-engineering; Metacognition; Neuronal Architecture; Reverse Networking; Synaptic Facilitation

We are better informed and can work more efficiently, yet there is anxiety about the security of our jobs. Examining what is happening to work, organizations and unions in the age of the Internet, this fascinating book reveals both the opportunities and dangers for workers in the digital age. Exploring the Internet's impact on organizations and labor from complementary perspectives, Jacobs and Yudken consider how new digital technologies shape cultural change. They look at the culmination of the development of the Internet, its impact upon jobs and the current prospects for unions, and conclude that the Internet ultimately reduces transaction costs thereby aiding profit making, and also assists workers, consumers and citizens in challenging business practices. Ideal for students of management, e-business and human resource management, this informative text is a balanced analysis of the Internet aided workplace.

"Watanabe C., Kondo R., Nagamatsu A.",Policy options for the diffusion orbit of competitive innovations - An application of Lotka-Volterra equations to Japan's transition from analog to digital TV broadcasting,2003,"Timely introduction of emerging new technologies that substitute for existing technologies is essential for enhancing a nation's international competitiveness in a globalizing economy. However, such substitution is generally slow because of a lack of information about new technologies, fear of substitution and a reluctance to pay the cost of switching to new technologies. While hasty substitution sometimes accomplishes nothing, delayed substitution can result in a loss of national competitiveness. Thus, policy options for the diffusion orbits of competitive innovations are crucial. This is particularly the case with respect to Japan's transition from analog to digital TV broadcasting, as the Japanese government, in order to minimize the impact of a transition delay, is urging a rapid shift from analog to digital TV broadcasting. In an ecosystem, in order to maintain sustainable development, predator-prey systems demonstrate a sophisticated balance. Given that an ecosystem can be used as a masterpiece system, this sophisticated balance provides suggestive ideas in deciding an optimal orbit of competitive innovations. This paper analyzes the optimal orbit for Japan's transition from analog to digital TV broadcasting, and on the basis of an application of Lotka-Volterra equations that analyze the sophisticated balance of predator-prey systems, it demonstrates the optimality of the Japanese government's scenario for shifting from analog to digital TV broadcasting. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Research questions were 1) to what extent does the process of technology culturation affect the acceptance of the Internet 2) to what extent do social norms (SNs) affect the acceptance of the Internet? Of the two research methods employed, the first was a quantitative field study of knowledge workers. The instrument measured the extent to which respondents and their organizations are influenced by advanced technology cultures. Using partial least squares (PLS), the first of two models tested links between SNs; technological culturation and Internet usage for each respondent. The second model investigated links between technological culturation and Internet utilization for the respondent's organization. Findings show strong support for both models, explaining, respectively, 47% and 37% of the variance. The second method was a qualitative analysis of respondents' free-format comments. These findings reinforce the quantitative findings, on the one hand, and reveal additional cultural barriers that still need to be studied, on the other.

Palacios J.J.,The development of e-commerce in Mexico: A business-led passing boom or a step toward the emergence of a digital economy?,2003,"Since its inception in the early 1990s, e-commerce has grown swiftly in Mexico, making inroads into some of the most dynamic sectors of the Mexican economy. The actual extent of e-commerce use, however, is still very limited, as diffusion is hindered by both the low income levels of most Mexican households and the fact that the overwhelming majority of business establishments are very small, lacking the resources to invest in computers and the business culture to go online. This article examines the emergence of e-commerce in Mexico arguing that the main drivers of the process have been the initiatives of large private firms and the work of specialized organizations. It concludes that this is not just a passing boom but a concrete step toward the rise of an Internet-based economy in Mexico along the lines of the New Economy that took shape in the United States in the 1990s and is assumed to spread into developing nations.",Business environment; E-commerce; Internet; Mexico

"Brynjolfsson E., Hu Y.J., Smith M.D.",Consumer surplus in the digital economy: Estimating the value of increased product variety at online booksellers,2003,"We present a framework and empirical estimates that quantify the economic impact of increased product variety made available through electronic markets. While efficiency gains from increased competition significantly enhance consumer surplus, for instance, by leading to lower average selling prices, our present research shows that increased product variety made available through electronic markets can be a significantly larger source of consumer surplus gains. One reason for increased product variety on the Internet is the ability of online retailers to catalog, recommend, and provide a large number of products for sale. For example, the number of book titles available at Amazon.com is more than 23 times larger than the number of books on the shelves of a typical Barnes & Noble superstore, and 57 times greater than the number of books stocked in a typical large independent bookstore. Our analysis indicates that the increased product variety of online bookstores enhanced consumer welfare by $731 million to $1.03 billion in the year 2000, which is between 7 and 10 times as large as the consumer welfare gain from increased competition and lower prices in this market. There may also be large welfare gains in other SKU-intensive consumer goods such as music, movies, consumer electronics, and computer software and hardware.",Consumer surplus; Electronic commerce; Internet; Product variety; Welfare

Individuals with a low cost of obtaining and handling copies are also more engaged in piracy.

Dougherty C.,"Numeracy, literacy and earnings: Evidence from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth",2003,"The analysis is concerned with the contributions of numeracy and literacy to earnings, for three reasons. First, no clear pattern emerges from existing findings relating to the contributions of different types of ability, and numeracy and literacy appear to be a natural basic starting point. Second, measures to improve numeracy and literacy are often given priority in policies intended to help those with lowest educational attainment. Third, with the growth of the knowledge-based economy, and the increasing importance of digital technology, it is of interest to compare the levels and rates of change of the contributions of numeracy and literacy as reflected in earnings. The results suggest that numeracy has a highly significant effect on earnings, mostly through its effect on college attainment, but also directly, controlling for attainment, and interactively with attainment, and its effect may be subject to increasing returns. While the magnitude of the effect is small in absolute terms, it is substantial when compared with other effects, and it appears to be increasing at a rate of 6% per year. Despite the fact that it has an even greater effect than numeracy on college attainment, literacy has a smaller and less significant effect on earnings, with no evidence of an interactive effect with attainment, nonlinearity, or change through time. Because of the absence of nonlinearity, measures to improve literacy may have more impact than measures to improve numeracy on the earnings of the least able, but the difference is not great and the quantitative effects appear to be small. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

This research examines how institution-based trust develops in online B2B marketplaces to facilitate interorganizational trust (buyers' trust in sellers). Building upon the notion of institutional trust [Zucker,1986], this study proposes how specific institution-based structures help engender interorganizational trust and indirectly influence transaction success in B2B marketplaces. Five specific institution-based mechanisms are proposed - perceived monitoring, perceived legal bonds, perceived accreditation, perceived feedback, and perceived cooperative norms. To assess the influence of the proposed two dimensions of interorganizational trust - credibility and benevolence - in buyer-seller relationships, three trust outcomes are examined - satisfaction, perceived risk, and continuity. The proposed model is tested on data from 102 organizational buyers in an online B2B marketplace. The results support the proposed model, delineating the relationship between institution-based trust and interorganizational trust. The study provides evidence on how specific institutional mechanisms build trust in online B2B marketplaces, stressing the ability of institution-based trust to build a trustworthy trading environment in the digital economy.

"Horner-Long P., Schoenberg R.",Does e-business require different leadership characteristics? An empirical investigation,2002,"Universal theories of leadership argue that all effective leaders share an identifiable set of common attributes. This suggests that the characteristics that have defined leadership in traditional bricks and mortar organisations are equally applicable to e-business. In contrast, contingency theories argue that a leader must match their environmental and organisational settings, suggesting that the different situational context of e-business will dictate a distinctive set of leadership characteristics. This paper empirically explores these opposing arguments. Data on the traits, behaviours and skills possessed by leaders of both e-businesses and traditional bricks and mortar companies were collected using a combination of questionnaire surveys and semi-structured interviews. Analysis of the data provides a degree of support for both arguments. The majority of characteristics possessed by leaders of traditional bricks and mortar organisations are found to be equally valued in the digital economy. There are, however, a certain number of characteristics that are emphasised within e-businesses. These include a propensity for risk taking, entrepreneurialism, networking ability, as well as the requisite technical skills. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Mussinelli C.,Europe's information technology: Focus on Italy's publishing industry,2002,"Conclusion: What is the future for Digital Publishing?: It is very difficult to understand the real value of all the different business models that have been introduced to the market in this very chaotic and evolving arena. The recent disillusions with the Internet and the ""new economy"" downturn have also made the publishing industry very cautious of investing in new business ventures. Many new projects have been suspended or postponed because they were based only on estimated or assumed online revenues. Meanwhile, very real operating expenses far exceeded original estimates or start-up budgets while sources of revenues remained elusive. On a more positive note, inside all the major publishing houses there is a stronger knowledge of the importance of creating a digital content database. Traditional publishers are learning that their intellectual property and editorial content can be used for many different products and delivered in many different media. Probably in the next months one of the big strategic issues will be the integration between the traditional print on paper products as the viable revenue model with all the other digital media in development. Finally, the questions remains how the market will accept as well as pay for content in different digital formats? © 2002 Transaction Publishers.",

"Madden G., Bloch H., Coble-Neal G.",Labour and capital saving technical change in telecommunications,2002,"The Australian telecommunications sector is being improved and extended through substantial recent investment in intelligent technology such as digital switching, fibre optics, satellite and cellular transmission, and the Internet. These technologies are being progressively integrated with technology from the broadcasting, computer and electronics industries, providing a unified information infrastructure for information transmission and processing. Technological progress embodied in new equipment has the effect of increasing the efficiency of the factors of production. Such efficiency increases can be biased towards a particular factor. For instance, the impact of labour-augmenting technical change is a decline in the cost of labour per unit of production. When such biases are apparent the relativity between the costs of labour and capital per unit of production is changed. In the longer term, technical change can impact on the rate of employment growth and also on the rate of capital accumulation. In this study the Australian telecommunications cost structure is examined for the period 1919 to 1988. To measure labour saving and capital saving technical change a translog cost model is estimated. Multiproduct telecommunications cost studies typically employ the translog cost model (Evans and Heckman, 1984; Röller, 1990a; 1990b; Shin and Ying, 1992; McKenzie and Small, 1997). The translog model places no a priori restrictions on substitution possibilities among the factors of production, and allows scale economies to vary with the level of output.",

Many researchers have started to investigate the optimal competitive strategies and market environments for such products. This paper studies the competitive decisions made about software, a major class of digital products that can be easily sold through computer networks. Instead of focusing on traditional competitive dimensions, such as price or quantity, we study the number of functions that should be incorporated into the software. Using game theoretic analysis, we show that there is no fixed strategy that is optimal for software developers in a duopoly market with one-stage simultaneous moves. This happens because, given one developer's decision, there is always an incentive for the other developer to deviate and achieve higher payoffs. Nevertheless, a unique reactive equilibrium does emerge if we consider the two-stage variation of the model, where the two developers both enjoy substantial profits by serving different segments of the market. Essentially, the first mover commits himself to a certain functionality level that induces a rational follower to target his software to the (previously) unattended segment. We discuss our results in light of scale economies in the software development process and market segmentation.",Development cost; Digital products; Functionality; Game theory; Software

Traditional “bricks and mortar” businesses are facing the prospects of losing their competitive advantage owing to the emergence of new competitors in the “new economy”. The regulatory changes in the financial services industry and the explosion in the use of the Internet for ecommerce have given rise to unforeseen competitors in the banking industry – the “nonbank” financial services providers and the “pure” Internet banks. These competitors are not restrained by the high costs of the branch infrastructure and as a result are able to differentiate on the basis of offering high interest rates. These players are fast and flexible. In spite of being newcomers, they have the potential to grow and recast the rules of the banking industry. Yet, incumbent banks still have the strongest sustainable competitive advantage: their corporate identity.

"Corrocher N., Ordanini A.",Measuring the digital divide: A framework for the analysis of cross-country differences,2002,"This article proposes a new model for measuring the digital divide within a set of countries or geographical areas. Starting from a series of elementary indicators the methodology groups these indicators into six factors of digitalization and, subsequently, aggregates the factors in a synthetic index called the synthetic index of digitalization. The dispersion in the distribution of the synthetic indexes of digitalization constitutes the measure of the digital divide. This method is based upon a measurement approach, which is different from the ones previously developed, since it uses principal components analysis for aggregating the variables and avoids many of the problems and limits shown by existing models. In the article an application of the methodology is provided within a set of ten developed countries for 2000 and 2001. The measurement framework for the digital divide presented here reveals new policy implications for public institutions and highlights opportunities and risks for managers working in the 'digital economy' environment.",

Plasmeijer H.W.,Pricing the serials library: In defence of a market economy,2002,"In this paper it is argued that the origin of the unremitting price increases of academic journals is at the demand site of the serials market. Given that for each and every scientific article the publisher is monopolist, for which he may or may not charge the monopoly price, almost the only thing which can explain the upward trend in prices are changing elasticities of demand. It is suggested that the enormous increase of scientific publications in the aftermath of the institutionalisation of the publish or perish regime in combination with the library organisation at most universities precisely produces this result. Libraries are organised as a common pool and the real consumer hardly faces any budget constraint. When offering contracts for digital access, the publishers' strategy seems to be bundling and first degree price discrimination. Prices of the bundles will be determined in negotiations. Empowerment of the university negotiaters requires that they have some influence on the impact score of a bundle. The paper ends with a few suggestions of how extraordinarily expensive commercial publishers can be punished by redirecting the real consumers' web searches. These suggestions imply that the common pool character of the library is gradually given up. © 2002, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. © 2002, Routledge.

In the digital economy, technology enabled learning or e-learning is becoming an integral part of a larger system of practices and policies designed to prepare and support a high skilled workforce. The power of e-learning comes from the opportunity to leverage technology and information to alter the basic tenets of learning by eliminating the one-size fits all approach to instruction and customizing content to meet individual needs and learning styles. Because e-learning has the potential to significantly improve workforce development, the American Society for Training and Development (ASTD) and the National Governors' Association (NGA) convened leaders from business, government, and education to examine how e-learning can equip workers with the skills needed to succeed. The culmination of this effort is outlined in A Vision of E-Learning for America's Workforce. The report makes the social and economic case for creating a sustainable e-learning environment for America's workforce and identifies priority areas for action for the public and private sectors to implement jointly.",
"Rezaee Z., Sharbatoghlie A., Elam R., McMickle P.L.",Continuous auditing: Building automated auditing capability,2002,"The digital economy has significantly altered the way business is conducted and financial information is communicated. A rapidly growing number of organizations are conducting business and publishing business and financial reports online and in real-time. Real-time financial reporting is likely to necessitate continuous auditing to provide continuous assurance about the quality and credibility of the information presented. The audit process has, by necessity, evolved from a conventional manual audit to computer-based auditing and is now confronted with creating continuous electronic audits. Rapidly emerging information technology and demands for more timely communication of information to business stakeholders requires auditors to invent new ways to continuously monitor, gather, and analyze audit evidence. Continuous auditing is defined here as ""a comprehensive electronic audit process that enables auditors to provide some degree of assurance on continuous information simultaneously with, or shortly after, the disclosure of the information."" This paper is based on a review of related literature, innovative continuous auditing applications, and the experiences of the authors. An approach for building continuous audit capacity is presented and audit data warehouses and data marts are described. Ever improving technology suggests that the real-time exchange of sensitive financial data will place constant pressure on auditors to update audit techniques. Most of the new techniques that will be required will involve creation of new software and audit models. Future research should focus on how continuous auditing could be constantly improved in various auditing domains including assurance, attestation, and audit services.",

Nowhere is this local character more overlooked yet paradoxically more evident than in Silicon Valley. The Valley persists as a densely interconnected innovative region, though its inhabitants loudly proclaim that the information technology they develop renders distance dead and place insignificant. It persists, we argue, because of the local character of innovative knowledge, which flows in social rather than digital networks. The locality of innovative knowledge highlights the challenge of developing other regions for the modern economy. Should these abandon traditional local strengths and strive to become another Silicon Valley? Or should they concentrate on their traditional strengths and rely on Silicon Valley and the other established high-tech regions to provide the necessary technology to survive in the digital age? We argue that they should do neither, but instead develop new technologies in service of their existing competencies and needs.

Utilising the perspectives of competitive advantage and national innovation systems theory, our work examines the evolution of Nokia's mobile phones and mobile, fixed and internet protocol (IP) networks divisions.

Among the most important are employment of the innovative industrial cluster concept, networking, and state promotion of an emerging information and communication technology (ICT) cluster through the liberalisation of the telephony market. Within the firm itself identification of core competencies (digital signal processing, electronics manufacturing, software platforms and architectures) and the development of niche markets has been important.

This paper places discussion of the digital divide in a broader economic context, linking it with the theory of economic growth and technological change. The network effects of diffusion of the Internet are related to the possibility of leap-frogging by latecomers. This is seen as a 'digital opportunity' presented to developing countries by the 'new economy'.

At the same time, many people, particularly in developing countries, are questioning the idea of paying for what they intuitively sense might possibly be free. In view of the potential for global dissensus on this issue, businesses that produce and distribute explicit knowledge, or digital sequences, would be quite prudent to start making contingency plans for a new form of global capitalism: one characterised by much weaker IPR regimes. Competitive business strategies based upon rival-complementarity (i.e. physical goods and human services that complement digital products) indicate the feasibility of a global economy-of-things, resting upon a freely accessible ecology of knowledge. This might be built in the future, in much the same way that an industrial economy was built, historically, upon a natural ecology of available land and biosystems.

This encourages a blurring of old and new firm identities, because sectoral power is increasingly necessary to secure cost recovery. But this does not imply any return to business as usual when the financial ecosystem for new technology survives the crash and large-scale venture capital investment continues. From this point of view, the new economy illustrated, concretely, the determining role of finance in the broader processes of financialization.",Business model; Capital market; Digital technologies; Financial ecosystem; Financialization; New economy
Martins M.L.C.,Social welfare loss due to second-best pricing: An application to the Portuguese telecommunications,2001,"The telecommunications industry is usually characterized by low marginal costs and significant fixed costs which are the conditions for the inefficiency of marginal cost pricing. In such cases theory postulates that optimal pricing is obtained by maximizing welfare subject to a restriction of viability of the firm: the second-best pricing scheme. The possible welfare losses due to second-best pricing varies according to the values of marginal costs, prices and demand elasticities. This paper analyses to what extent the second-best pricing has been achieved in the Portuguese telecommunications firm CTT, over the period 1950-1984 as well as the magnitude of the price-cost margins and welfare losses created. We obtained empirical evidence of the presence of economies of scale, a welfare loss estimate of 1% of the telecommunications receipts and a result that price was 40% greater than marginal cost. We concluded that price regulation and public ownership of the firm did not seriously affect social welfare over the sample period (it should be noted that it is the non-digital and fixed-wire infrastructure period). Therefore, it is important to study the impact of new digital and non-wire technologies and new services provided in the old regulatory scenery.",
Takahashi T.,The role of knowledge and organization in the competitiveness of Japanese high-tech industry,2001,"In the 1980s Japan was viewed as the world leader in high technology. Its superiority in electronics and other manufacturing sectors created the enigma of the Japanese management system and trade friction with the USA. Today the sharp decline in Japan's competitiveness has become another enigma and even a trouble in the world economy. This paper addresses the contrast between Japan's high-tech industry in the 1980s and that in the 1990s. The ascendance of Japanese high-tech industry up until the 1980s has been attributed to tacit knowledge and the organization of Japanese firms based on shared knowledge. The competitive decline during the 1990s has been viewed as a failure of the Japanese assembly industry to adapt to the change in explicit knowledge embodied in the digital revolution. In this paper the author produces a more comprehensive explanation for the decline in the competitiveness of the Japanese high-tech industry by introducing a comparison between science-driven sectors, which rely on the sharing of tacit knowledge, and engineering-driven sectors, which should rely more on explicit knowledge such as is found in strategic components. The author argues that different forms of organization are appropriate to different types of knowledge exchange. He concludes that current changes in the organization of Japanese firms and research will stimulate the science-driven sector of the country's high-tech industry.",Breakthrough innovation; Digital revolution; Doctrine of workshop and actual entity; Engineering-driven; Information-driven; Science-driven

"Romano A., Passiante G., Elia V.",New sources of clustering in the digital economy,2001,"Using a sample of 29 virtual clusters, the paper examines new sources of clustering in the digital economy. The “virtual cluster” phenomenon highlights the most significant effect of the development of the information and communication technologies in the business environment. A virtual cluster is conceived as an e-business community, made up of customers, suppliers, distributors and commerce providers sharing digital and knowledge networks for collaboration and competition. The purpose of this paper is to set out the characteristics of a new competitive space, in which a strategic role is played by virtual processes among partners, and to review the traditional sources of clustering in the digital economy environment (Romano et al., 1999). More specifically, this paper attempts to show the emerging overlap between digital and knowledge networks, which generates a new competitive space within a new global-virtual learning environment. Finally, assuming that traditional sources of clustering are generally identified in specialisation (based on a sophisticated division of labour) and geographic proximity, the paper discusses how the role of organisational proximity acts as a substitute for geographic proximity in supporting coordination and tacit knowledge exchange. As it emerges from the analysis of our cases, from a managerial point of view, organisational proximity may be achieved through the implementation of supply chain management (SCM) and customer relationship management (CRM) strategies.

This broad question has motivated the work behind the present work, which reviews the strongest themes of the Third International Conference on Technology Policy and Innovation (ICTPI), which was held in Austin, TX, in August of 1999. Under the broad designation of ""creating value for the 21st century in the globalized learning economy,"" the Conference brought together a range of experts to discuss technology policy and the management of innovation in a context much influenced by a dynamic of change and a necessary balance between the creation and diffusion of knowledge. While the idea of inclusive development developed in previous Conferences entails a process of shared prosperity across the globe following local specific conditions, it is crucial to understand both the features of knowledge-induced growth in rich countries, as well as the challenges and opportunities for late-industrialized and less developed countries. Thus, this special issue includes a set of extended contributions to the Austin conference that are largely grounded on empirical experiences of different regional and national contexts. The aim of this introductory paper is to set the stage for these contributions, with an original contribution on possible roles for science and technology policy in the globalized economy. While much attention has been devoted to digital technologies, a more fundamental change at the start of the new millennium is the increasing importance of knowledge for economic prosperity and the emergence of a learning society. The analysis shows that innovation should be understood as a broad social and economic activity within the framework of that society: it should transcend any specific technology, even if revolutionary, and should be tied to attitudes and behaviors oriented towards the exploitation of change by adding value. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.",

Ishaq A.,On the global digital divide,2001,"The Digital and information revolution presents a historic opportunity for developing countries to take a quantum leap forward, develop their own productive and creative capacities, and become integrated into the global virtual economy. However, Internet density (users as a percentage of population) is still much higher in industrial countries, as well as in affluent and educated communities in every country, than elsewhere. The Internet threatens to magnify the existing socioeconomic disparities, between those with access and those without, to levels unseen and untenable. Therefore, urgent actions are needed at the local, national, and international levels to bridge the global digital divide. This article outlines both the digital opportunity and the digital divide and argues that bridging the divide is a precondition for a worldwide creativity revolution to blossom.",

Based on findings of the ILO's World Employment Report 2001, this article summarizes the extent of the digital divide, analyses the economic effects of ICT use, and describes fundamental policies underlying successful entry into the information economy of certain developing countries. Finally, some international initiatives promoting ""ICTs for development"" are considered.",
Lee C.-S.,An analytical framework for evaluating e-commerce business models and strategies,2001,"Electronic commerce or business is more than just another way to sustain or enhance existing business practices. Rather, e-commerce is a paradigm shift. It is a ""disruptive"" innovation that is radically changing the traditional way of doing business. The industry is moving so fast because it operates under totally different principles and work rules in the digital economy. A general rule in e-commerce is that there is no simple prescription and almost no such thing as an established business or revenue model for companies even within the same industry. Under such conditions, an analytical framework is needed to assist e-commerce planners and strategic managers in assessing the critical success factors when formulating e-commerce business models and strategies. This research develops an analytical framework based on the theories of transaction costs and switching costs. Both demand-side and supply-side economies of scale and scope are also applied to the development of this framework. In addition, e-commerce revenue models and strategies are also discussed. Based on the analytical framework developed by this research, this paper discusses the five essential steps for e-commerce success. They are: redefine the competitive advantage; rethink business strategy; re-examine traditional business and revenue models, re-engineer the corporation and Web site; and re-invent customer service. E-commerce planners and strategic managers will be able to use the framework to analyze and evaluate the critical successful factors for e-commerce success.",Economy; Innovation; Internet; Strategy

Companies' initiatives to handle churn and customers' profitability issues have been directed to more customer-oriented strategies. In this paper, we present a customer relationship management framework based on the integration of the electronic channel. This framework is constituted of four tools that should provide an appropriate collection, treatment and analysis of data. From this perspective, we pay special attention to some of the latest data mining developments which, we believe, are destined to play a central role in churn management.

Successful electronic commerce activities depend on the partners involved in the product or service being delivered. Firms able to communicate with their partners electronically for procurement, sales, or supply chain management have become what many call clicks-and-mortar companies. An empirically based technological model that helps organizations understand the requirements of moving towards the seamless integration of intra- and inter-organizational processes is proposed. This five-wave transitional model accompanies key decision-makers through progressive steps that correspond to different business-to-business e-commerce needs and specifications. As organizations move along these technological waves, we can witness the gradual opening-up of new opportunities for carrying out business. This paper presents the model, its requirements and its technological and organizational underpinnings.

"Kannan P.K., Kopalle P.K.",Dynamic pricing on the Internet: Importance and implications for consumer behavior,2001,"The pricing of products and services sold over the Internet channel is becoming more dynamic. In part this is due to the increasing use of auction models in business and consumer markets to sell commodities, excess inventories, used merchandise, rare items collectibles, and other items. Marketers are resorting to dynamic prices even for goods and services sold at posted prices, spurred partly by the lower menu cost of changing prices on the Internet and partly as a response to consumer use of price-comparison bots. This paper explains the relevance of dynamic pricing in the digital economy by comparing the physical value chain with the virtual-information-based value chain. It explores the implications of certain aspects of dynamic pricing in consumer markets (e.g., dynamic pricing of posted prices, reverse auction pricing of goods and services as used by Priceline) from the perspective of consumer price expectations, the role of information and consumer learning, and their impact on consumer responses to prices across different product categories.

Deregulation has been driven by both ideological and technological demands, stemming from several political and economic transformations in the world economy, the collapse of state socialism in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, and greater oligopolistic competition among transnational corporations. An expanded infrastructure of new digital information and communications technology (ICT) is the foundation of a worldwide political economic regime of accumulation. ICT increases command and control capabilities of large corporations, together with the mobility and liquidity of capital, making it essential to the restructuring of the world economy, the new international division of labor, and the creation of global ""information city"" networks. At the same time, government deregulation and rapid technological change are associated with a number of spatial, economic, and social dualisms.",Cities; Deregulation; Information technology; Telecommunications; Transnational corporations

This chapter critically reviews concepts, experience, and evidence bearing on this new approach to business in the digital and global economy. Key aspects of the available literature (academic, consulting, and practice) are identified. It is important not to conflate an evolutionary theory of the firm with an interpretation of the causes, logic, and effects of a particular stage of that evolution. While recent forecasts are reasonable projections of the opportunities opened by advanced communication technologies and likely falling prices for communication, the projections tend to be general inform.

Like other governments worldwide, UK Online's SME targets (together with the supporting DTI adoption ladder) exemplify the ""conventional wisdom"" view of a homogeneous small business sector, within which firms take an ordered, sequential progression on the route to Internet technology adoption. This approach is questioned by grounding the official rhetoric in the reality of organisational and operational complexity of this important sector of the UK economy. These initiatives are compared and contrasted with similar models of small firm development, most of which neglected to address the diverse nature of small firm needs.

Ranft A.L.,Board composition and high-flying founders: Hints of trouble to come?,2001,"High-flying founders are the rock stars of the new economy and the dot-corn world. Jeff Bezos at Amazon, Stephen Case at America Online, Bill Gates at Microsoft are strong leaders of great companies. Previous generations produced great businesses and legendary leaders too, and many of them made mistakes of grand proportions. Henry Ford failed to see the value of diversification until nearly too late. Kenneth O/sen, cofounder of Digital Equipment Corp., suffered a form of myopia in the computer industry. Clearly, confidence born of great achievements can lead to overly conservative responses to business threats. We believe that business success creates personal and organizational forces that lead to a form of cautious conservatism, and perhaps arrogant disdain, in the face of competitive pressures for high-flying firms. One protection against this inertia-inducing conservatism is a strong board. Successful founding CEOs, however, show a tendency towards adopting weak boards. Farsighted CEOs, and their board-level advisors, can pay attention to the design and behavior of boards in high-flying firms. These founders can avoid the traps of success, and maintain the entrepreneurial zest that builds their companies and their reputations.",
"Tonglet M., Johnstone P.",E-Commerce Risks in the ‘Open and Competitive Market’,2001,"The face of the business market has changed beyond all recognition over the past decade, and while there is much talk of global markets some facts are indisputable. Europe is increasingly becoming a unified market, particularly in the field of financial services. The world economy is also becoming more transparent and open, which should lead to an increase in market opportunities, as well as to increased competition. Capital has become a highly mobile commodity, and with more use of Internet banking facilities and the use of e-cash this will continue to intensify. New industries are being created through technological advances. In many instances these developments are extremely rapid, and the technology itself frequently allows new market participants to enter with minimal capital investment or established expertise. And the future economic prosperity of the UK will significantly depend on the ability this country has to adapt to the demands of increasingly knowledgeable and mobile consumers. One of the fundamental issues at stake for the credibility of UK business is whether it can sustain a competitive edge while at the same time ensuring that the rights of consumers and service providers are sufficiently well protected according to European and domestic legislation. Until recently the balance between ensuring fair treatment of consumers while promoting business productivity has been achieved within an environment of relatively slow-moving market forces. The digital age has now arrived and the response from governments must be as rapid as the fast-moving world in which international commerce is conducted. It is against the background of consumer and business use of computer and communications technology for the commercial exchange of products, services and information that the future of e-commerce in the UK is discussed in this paper. © 2001, MCB UP Limited",

This exploration is situated against the background of an increasing awareness of the fictionality of organizational life, and a sensitivity towards the representational practices employed by organizational scholars as they seek to construct persuasive accounts of the theory and practice of organization. By pushing standard interpretative and representational practices to their limits, we can reveal their arbitrariness (and sometimes absurdity), and thus open up new positions of intelligibility. In the denatured contexts of the digital economy, Borges' fantastic fictions appear closer to temporal experience than the authoritative discourses with which mainstream organizational discourse has accustomed us. © 2000, Walter de Gruyter.

We articulate the platform logic as a conceptual framework for both viewing the organizing of IT management activities as well as for framing important questions for future research. In articulating this logic, we aim to shift thinking away from the traditional focus on governance structures (i.e., choice of centralized, decentralized, or federal forms) and sourcing structures (i.e., insourcing, outsourcing) and toward more complex structures that are reflective of contemporary practice. These structures are designed around important IT capabilities and network architectures.",IT Capabilities; IT Management; Organizational Design

"Bakos Y., Brynjolfsson E.",Bundling and competition on the internet,2000,"The Internet has significantly reduced the marginal cost of producing and distributing digital information goods. It also coincides with the emergence of new competitive strategies such as large-scale bundling. In this paper, we show that bundling can create ""economies of aggregation"" for information goods if their marginal costs are very low, even in the absence of network externalities or economies of scale or scope. We extend the Bakos-Brynjolfsson bundling model (1999) to settings with several different types of competition, including both upstream and downstream, as well as competition between a bundler and single good and competition between two bundlers. Our key results are based on the ""predictive value of bundling,"" the fact that it is easier for a seller to predict how a consumer will value a collection of goods than it is to value any good individually. Using a model with fully rational and informed consumers, we use the Law of Large Numbers to show that this will be true as long as the goods are not perfectly correlated and do not affect each other's valuations significantly. As a result, a seller typically can extract more value from each information good when it is part of a bundle than when it is sold separately. Moreover, at the optimal price, more consumers will find the bundle worth buying than would have bought the same goods sold separately. Because of the predictive value of bundling, large aggregators will often be more profitable than small aggregators, including sellers of single goods. We find that these economies of aggregation have several important competitive implications: 1. When competing for upstream content, larger bundlers are able to outbid smaller ones, all else being equal. This is because the predictive value of bundling enables bundlers to extract more value from any given good. 2. When competing for downstream consumers, the act of bundling information goods makes an incumbent seem ""tougher"" to single-product competitors selling similar goods. The resulting equilibrium is less profitable for potential entrants and can discourage entry in the bundler's markets, even when the entrants have a superior cost structure or quality. 3. Conversely, by simply adding an information good to an existing bundle, a bundler may be able to profitably enter a new market and dislodge an incumbent who does not bundle, capturing most of the market share from the incumbent firm and even driving the incumbent out of business. 4. Because a bundler can potentially capture a large share of profits in new markets, single-product firms may have lower incentives to innovate and create such markets. At the same time, bundlers may have higher incentives to innovate. For most physical goods, which have nontrivial marginal costs, the potential impact of large-scale aggregation is limited. However, we find that these effects can be decisive for the success or failure of information goods. Our results have particular empirical relevance to the markets for software and Internet content and suggest that aggregation strategies may take on particular relevance in these markets.",Bundling; Competition; Digital goods; Information goods; Internet; Pricing; Software
Svennevig M.,"Needs, not nerds: Researching technological change",2000,"The growth of information and communications technologies (ICTs) and the ‘digital world’ is not as evenly spread as might be assumed. Among developed economies, there exist large-scale differences in uptake. Equally, such differences are found within national populations. Data gathered from the University of Leeds futura.com panel which was set up in 1996 indicate that consumer interest and potential uptake may be less rapid than predicted in some quarters. Also, there is little support for the proposition that the new IT-based technologies such as the internet are straightforwardly displacing other forms of technology.

"Chavez R., Leiter M., Kiely T.",Should you spin off your internet business?,2000,"The purpose of most corporate spin-offs is to unlock the shareholder value of a business unit that is not critical to the parent company's success. Internet spin-offs raise additional problems, partly because they are so new. This article sets out a multi-dimensional framework to help managers decide how to structure their internet businesses: Whether to keep them integrated into the parent company, to establish them as wholly-owned subsidiaries or to spin them off ‘wholly or partially’. The authors argue that companies must weigh the trade-offs between what they call the ‘three Cs’: Control, currency and culture. The collapse of internet stock prices in April/May 2000 reduced but did not eliminate then ‘currency’ attraction of the spin-off option. But issues of control and culture were always just as important. Above all, the decision must be made in the context of a company's total ‘digital agenda’: that is, as part of a company's overall strategy for creating and sustaining value in the new economy. © London Business School.",
Fountain J.E.,"Constructing the information society: Women, information technology, and design",2000,"For the first time in history, women have the opportunity to play a major and visible role in a social transformation of potentially monumental proportions. The extensive reach and penetration of information technology into virtually every area of society creates enormous opportunities for women. But women's lack of representation in IT design roles may prevent them from capitalizing on these opportunities. Most current discussion and analysis focuses on the increasing numbers of women as users of information technology with great emphasis on their use of the Internet and World Wide Web. Comparatively little attention has been given to the potential role women might play as designers in an information-based society. As the data in this paper clearly indicate, women are poorly represented in the sector that constitutes the growth engine of the U.S. economy and that bears primary responsibility for the scientific and technological development of an Information Society. The human capital requirements of the Information Society demonstrate the need for women to strengthen their participation as experts, owners and designers of information technologies. This paper argues that stronger representation by women in technical roles not only would help to redress a troubling human capital deficit, but is highly likely to modify and expand the range of technological applications, products, standards and practices to benefit all of society. On the importance of women as scientific and technical experts. To develop this argument, the paper surveys across several policy areas to identify a central challenge that does not neatly fit into established policy categories. The first section of this paper distinguishes between the types of contributions that may be made by users of information technology versus its designers. The second section surveys current participation rates of women in IT-related fields within education and industry in order to gauge the near-term supply of women designers and experts. The third section argues, by analogy to the fields of medicine and psychology, that the degree of participation by women is likely to have a notable effect on professional practice and technological developments within the fields that constitute information technology. The current economy presents a stellar opportunity for women to assume leadership roles in research and development of information technologies and applications. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, use of the Internet, World Wide Web and other digital technologies continues to proliferate. The U.S. economy and its labor needs have shifted radically producing a serious deficit of IT workers. The U.S. Department of Commerce uses the following definitions and categories to denote information technology and related occupations: computer scientists, computer engineers, systems analysts and computer programmers. The classification is based on categories used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Demand for workers able to develop, apply and use these technologies extends beyond the computer and software industries into service industries, including health care, manufacturing, transportation, government and education. Information technology accounted for more than a third of the nation's real economic growth from 1995 to 1997. If not addressed, labor market shortages in information technology related occupations are estimated to diminish national productivity, the development of new products and services, economic growth, and national competitiveness. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that approximately 137 800 new jobs in information technology occupations have been and will be produced each year from 1996 to 2006. The U.S. educational system awarded only 24 098 bachelor's degrees and 9658 associate's degrees in computer and information sciences in 1995 and 1996. Immigration policy has recently been modified, with passage of the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act of 1998, to meet the current shortfall of IT workers. Firms seek to employ skilled workers from abroad, notably from India, Russia, Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia and South Africa. But while the U.S. government has temporarily raised the quota of skilled non-immigrant visas to accommodate increased demand, the legislation includes a sunset provision that mandates lowering the cap by 2002. Even if immigration levels are not reduced, evidence of a global deficit of information technology workers is likely to constrain the ability of firms to use immigration policy and global outsourcing of IT activities. The U.S. political economy requires modernization of domestic employment and education policies to sustain growth in the information society. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Worlock D.R.,After content: The business of information in the postcopyright age,2000,"It is argued that the age of print is coming to a close more rapidly than had been predicted in the 1990s and that the system of ownership and control of content, embodied in the concept of copyright, will not survive into the digital age. Examples include the recent US legal rulings regarding the Napster (www.napster. com) and MP3 (www.mp3.com) Web sites for exchanging music, that have revealed the inadequacies of the US Copyright Act in the context of a modern communication model. In the post-copyright world of the Internet and World Wide Web, intellectual property will be traded in a different and, arguably, a more rational way. It is stressed that those who have argued most fervently about the primacy of content have not been the authors, artists or originators (the owners of the copyrights), but those who have only had access by licence. It is argued that the debate is not one about the ultimate ownership of content, but about its tradable status and the emphasis is quickly switching away from content and towards context. Some of the new, emerging business models are discussed including: free information acting as promotion for commercial services; advertising and sponsorship; vertically organized information services; and users-as-publishers. Concludes that in the mixed economy of the Web all of these models are likely to survive. In these networked content environments, the legal framework of exchange will be contract and licence while content and copyright will become forgotten concepts. © 2000, Sage Publications.

No, the reason we ask them now is because we recognize that we are living through one of the most exciting periods of change in history. Virtually everything we do in our daily lives, in our work, and, yes, throughout our governance structures, is experiencing-or will soon experience-fundamental transformation. In its wake, the digital revolution will remake the two distinct yet intertwined relationships between people and their governments: the one between the government and the citizen as customer or consumer of public services, and the other between the government and the citizen as owner or shareholder. In the digital era, no less than a radical rethinking of the nature and functioning of the organization called government is required; no less than a dramatic transformation of the citizen-government and business-government relationships will result.",
Body R.,European multiple currencies,1999,"Considers the aims of the “founding fathers” of the European Community in creating a free trade area based on the notion that “If the goods cross the frontiers, the armies won't”. Looks at the likely impact of monetary union and argues that a single currency, with the consequent removal of floating exchange rates, will have the opposite effect, being seen as unfair and giving rise to friction and disunity within the EU. Digital money is seen as a medium of exchange allowing a more fair distribution throughout the economy but has yet to prove that it will successfully facilitate floating exchange rates. A more equitable solution, it is suggested, is that local government units have the power to issue and control their own local currencies to stimulate local trade. This would have the advantage of giving local people the power to buy and sell, stimulating economic growth particularly in disadvantaged areas. © 1999, MCB UP Limited",Currency options; EMU; Free trade; Money
Tan M.,Creating the Digital Economy: Strategies and Perspectives from Singapore,1999,"Based on the concept of the information superhighway in the United States, many countries around the world have planned their own information highways. In the Asia-Pacific region, Singapore laid the foundation of its information highway as early as the 1980s, and today, at the turn of the millennium, its vision of a smart city, or intelligent island, is becoming a reality. Singapore ONE (One Network for Everyone), a nationwide broadband high-speed network launched in 1997, delivers interactive multimedia applications and services to every home, school, and office in Singapore. One-stop, non-stop business and government services, cybershopping, on-line banking, Internet trading, virtual college, and digital library are some of the implementations of its electronic commerce hub. This paper provides an analysis of how Singapore is creating a digital economy that will have a tremendous impact on its ability to succeed and sustain its strategic advantage.",Digital economy; National information infrastructure; Technology diffusion

An N-good bundling model with multi-dimensional consumer preferences is developed to study the key factors that determine the optimal bundling strategy. Using analytical and empirical methods, mixed bundling is established as the dominant (i.e. profit maximizing) strategy. Pure unbundling is also shown to outperform pure bundling, even in the presence of some degree of economies of scale, if consumers positively value only a subset of the bundle components, which is the predominant case in the academic journal context. These results provide strong incentives for academic journal publishers to engage in mixed bundling, i.e. offer both individual articles and journal subscriptions, when selling and delivering over the Internet. © Elsevier Science B.V.",Bundling; Information goods; Journals
Hozic A.A.,"Uncle sam goes to siliwood: Of landscapes, spielberg and hegemony",1999,"This article explores the impact of Hollywood’s increasingly prominent role in the financing and development of digital technology on the resurgence and restructuring of American hegemony. It argues that the true relevance of the alliance between Hollywood and the US military- industrial complex, and of the overall technological convergence among sectors as disparate as film, broadcasting, software and telecommunications, cannot be grasped without looking at the broader context of ‘privatization of authority’ and consolidation of merchant power in the world economy. The emergence of Siliwood - the hybrid sector that weds Hollywood and Silicon Valley - shifts debates about US economic and military dominance onto the issues of culture, play and entertainment, and continues to obscure - both discursively and spatially - the distinctions between public and private, politics and economics, work and leisure that have long been regarded as the precondition of bourgeois hegemony. By blurring these boundaries, allowing for the emergence of new hegemonic blocs, and constructing new spatial ‘comfort zones’, the American entertainment industry has successfully managed to reinvigorate and reinscribe US hegemony at the end of this very American century. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Cyberspace; Digital technology; Hegemony; Hollywood; Military-industrial complex; Public/private distinction

One scenario put forth is that of an era in which people work wherever they choose but live in small neighbourly and well-thought-out communities - urban villages. The argument made in this article is that this will not happen until we harness more effectively the potential of these technologies. Once this is accomplished, a wave of urban villages could happen. But if it comes, it will be more of a trickle than a wave, at least for a while, largely because of the continued importance of face-to-face contact in a good deal of business activity.",Business strategy; Information technology; Urban economy

"Blumentritt R., Johnston R.",Towards a strategy for knowledge management,1999,"Knowledge management is emerging as a significant organizational and management challenge. The pressures of the emergence of the global knowledge economy, and recognition of knowledge as a key and intangible asset are making the effective management of knowledge a priority. This surge of interest has paid relatively little attention to the object of management-knowledge. Epistemologists and sociologists have produced a variety of definitions and classifications, but there is no consensus. However, with the growth in IT capability, a clear operational distinction can be drawn between information and knowledge. The former can be captured, stored and transmitted in digital form. The latter can only exist in an intelligent system. This distinction is used to develop models of the interaction between knowledge and information, and of the appropriate balance between the two in different situations. On the basis of this model, the challenges of 'knowledge management' are: Establishing and optimizing the information-knowledge balance appropriate to (or providing a competitive advantage) a company or industry; Implementing IT-based productivity improvements in information management; Implementing people-and socially-based mechanisms to enhance knowledge management; Explicitly addressing the knowledge-information interface and mechanisms for improving the processes of transition from information to knowledge, and from knowledge to information; Identifying and maintaining the core knowledge of an organization.",
Roberds R.M.,Developing an Integrated Curriculum in Science for Higher Education,1998,"In the early 1990s James Madison University embarked on the creation of a new college of science. All aspects of the new college were to be constructed from basic beginnings: a provost would be hired to design and lead the development plan, all buildings were to be designed and built as needed, faculty would be hired and student recruitment initiated. The teaching approaches would be consistent with the national calls for teaching reform in science and engineering, and the curriculum would be specifically designed to meet the needs of the 21st century. The college was named the College of Integrated Science and Technology, and the new, innovative program that would be the college's flagship program was called the Integrated Science and Technology Program (ISAT). It was decided early that information and knowledge management would be a unifying glue for the curriculum, which would be aimed at educating science generalists. Because the acquisition of information and creation of knowledge pervades the practice of science and the creation of technology, information and knowledge management skills and tools would be at the heart of the program. After all, information and knowledge, and the digital technologies that manipulate them, are crucial factors in the economy and should be central to the ISAT program. This article focuses on the creation of the curriculum of this new program that was largely done on an ad hoc basis, but with a highly motivated group of interdisciplinary faculty. The process for developing the curriculum was defined, often by hit-and-miss techniques, the goals and objectives were articulated, and the curriculum and courses were produced. But the development process emerged as the basic key to effectively creating the curriculum. It was a process that called for iteration and correction of faults as the program unfolded. Finally, an unexpected by-product was the spontaneous creation of a unique culture among the faculty, staff, and students. This turned out to be a sustaining force and an essential ingredient for success for the enterprise.",Curriculum development; Information and knowledge management; Integrated curriculum; Integrated science; Science; Teaching reform; Technology

Data for the years 1988 to 1992 are examined and the results establish that the generation of multiple outputs, using the resources infrastructure that the firms possess, does lead to reduction in average unit costs for the firms studied. The results thus shed light on a hitherto empirically ambiguous issue in telecommunications research, the relationship between diversity of operations and firm-level efficiency. Additionally, the deployment of digital technology has a positive and significant impact in reducing costs, across the multiple cost categories that are analyzed, providing support for the notion that technology diffusion is positively associated with superior firm performance.",Digital technology diffusion; Economies of scope; Firm diversity; L96; Strategic performance analysis; Telecommunications industry
Ványai J.,A new era: the development of telecommunications in Hungary,1998,"After the transition to a market economy, a new period of transition opened up in Hungarian telecommunications. A program of developmental 'catch-up' began in earnest with the aim of building a digital network and increasing national telephone density. The financial resources came from bank loans and from the privatization of the Hungarian Telecommunciation Company. The firmer telecommunication monopoly was abolished and new actors, based on concession rights, appeared in the market. The immediate result was a sudden improvement in telephone penetration: telephone density doubled between 1991 and 1995, from 10.9 to 21.2; three companies began operating a mobile telephone system. Against these attractive developments there also arose many problems: out-of-date and inappropriate regulations; the changing role of the state in this new 'strategy' sector; the risk that development requirements would hinder the activity of local telephone companies; varying technologies which created issues of compatibility and interfacing; and an unexpected traffic decrease because of the high tariffs.",

[No author name available],Chapter 4 The Non-Existent Highway and Its Non-Convergent Industrial Origins,1997,"Bill Gates, Chairman and CEO of Microsoft Corporation, holds that the Information Highway does not exist, and that it would not be available to most US homes for at least a decade. Where one of the most knowledgeable authorities on Information Technology (IT) fears to tread, wordsmiths rush in. Don Tapscott, for one, affirms that the dominant economic sector in the Digital Economy is being created by three converging industries and that convergence is becoming the basis of all sectors. Convergence in mathematics is the progressive approach of a function to a pre-specified value(s). If a thousand coins are tossed, the number of heads in a single toss could vary from 0 head to 1,000 heads. If the coins are not loaded, the number of heads in each toss could be high or low, but in successive tosses, the fraction of heads will approach closer and closer to 0.5 (Converge( as n, the number of tosses, tends to infinity. Tapscott provides no measures of convergence — conceptual, theoretical, empirical, or operational — without which we would not know if convergence has indeed descended upon us; what is more, we have no idea if we are/are not progressing toward the consummation of convergence upon which Tapscott's Digital Economy is predicated. Even more damaging to the Tapscott thesis of “three converging industries … becoming the basis of all sectors” is the conspicuous absence of any movement toward convergence on the part of the leading firms in the three industries. On the contrary, we find that each of them is racing on its own Divergent path of high and higher tech. Both the CEOs of IBM and Microsoft believe that high-speed, high-bandwidth is the future; and both swear by the Internet. But they race toward the Information Super Highway in their own separate, individual tracks. Product and service differentiation are the rule of the day; not standardization. Open architecture is a distant dream. Turning from the giant of hardware (IBM) and of software (Microsoft) to the giant of communications (AT&T), what is the story of convergence? AT&T entered the field of computers under the MFJ [Modified Final Judgment] of 1982. It beat a decisive path of retreat from convergence five years later by breaking up on January 1, 1997, into three communications and computer companies. How can the 3Cs converge? Not by their own volition. It is clear from the strategies of IBM, Microsoft, and AT&T that each of them is racing on its own path of high and higher tech. There is little evidence of convergence by default. If we want to achieve convergence by design, we have to emulate Hannibal. Facing the European Alps with his army of elephants, Hannibal said: “I will either find a way or invent one.” We will have to invent an appropriate methodology of convergence. © 1997, MCB UP Limited",

Our model takes advantage of the special capabilities of the DCS technology and is likely to result in remarkable economic gains for the private network users. The formulation and analyses presented here simultaneously address the following problems: physical link and capacity selection, logical network configuration and channel assignment, and traffic routing on the logical network. The problem formulation results in a large-scale non-linear mixed integer program, and we propose an efficient solution methodology employing Lagrangean relaxation and subgradient optimization. Several numerical results illustrate the utility of our approach for these complex problems. We show that the economies of scale built into the tariff structure of these digital networks can be successfully exploited, and that the inherent flexibility of DCSs leads to logical networks that are dramatically different from their underlying physical topologies. © 1995 Elsevier Science B.V.

Kamberidou I.,“Distinguished” women entrepreneurs in the digital economy and the multitasking whirlpool,2020,"How are women entrepreneurs transforming and challenging traditional understandings of professional success in the 21st century, despite the multitasking whirlpool? What type of knowledge and skills are required in today’s digital world to develop professionally and succeed as an entrepreneur? What are the major barriers to successful entrepreneurship preventing women from realizing their full potential or stopping them from even beginning an entrepreneurial career? A current literature review (2011–2019) on women’s entrepreneurial initiatives, skills, characteristics, attributes, motives and leadership styles, documenting strategies for success and barriers confronted, indicates that not much has changed. Women entrepreneurs continue to face the multitasking whirlpool, along with the lack of financial resources, marketing skills and support services, including poor access to business networks, technology and digital markets. Despite the mass entry of women in exclusively male domains, glass ceilings have not been shattered. Then again, developed and developing nations have come to understand that women’s entrepreneurial activities contribute to socioeconomic growth and utilizing the full potential of all human resources is essential for sustainable development. Studies of the 21st century—as those of the late 20th century —continue to spotlight gender gaps in entrepreneurship as well as the so-valued career–family balance, while still arguing that further research is needed. They also agree that successful entrepreneurship requires digital skills along with the drive for innovation. The successful entrepreneur, or to use a term and concept coined by Elias G. Carayannis and McDonald R. Stewart (2013), the “distinguished entrepreneur” regardless of gender, is an innovator; a visionary; a person who predicts and shapes the future; takes initiatives; accepts change, risk and failure; learns from it; and sees what others do not see, among other things. Accordingly, this study presents snapshots of lives changed and empowered. It includes the work and narratives of “distinguished” (Carayannis & Stewart 2013) women entrepreneurs who have made a difference.

"Qu C., Shao J., Cheng Z.",Can embedding in global value chain drive green growth in China's manufacturing industry?,2020,"Whether embedding in global value chain(GVC)can promote China's manufacturing industry green growth is of great importance for China to accelerate the realization of green economy transformation and building of China's high-quality modern ecological economic system. This paper analyzes the impact of embedding in GVC on China's manufacturing industry green growth from perspectives of embedding position and embedding degree, using panel data from 17 manufacturing industries from 2000 to 2014. The study finds that during the inspection period, GVC embedding position and embedding degree of China's manufacturing industry have a fluctuation and there is a large difference between industries, most industries are still in the downstream of GVC, and low-tech industries embedding in GVC to a deeper degree. In the meantime, China's manufacturing industry green growth level has declined, and green growth situation is not optimistic. Dynamic panel results show that raising the GVC embedding position can significantly promote China's manufacturing industry green growth. Further, threshold regression is used to find that when the embedding position crosses a certain threshold, the effect of increasing the GVC embedding degree on green growth changes from inhibition to promotion. And the effect of GVC embedding position and degree on China's manufacturing industry green growth has significant industry heterogeneity. Finally, based on the research conclusions, concrete implications for promoting China's manufacturing industry green growth are put forward: First, China should improve the GVC embedding position of manufacturing industry and enhance the value-added and control capabilities of the value chain. Second, China should increase the GVC high-end links embedding degree of manufacturing industry. While realizing value chain functional upgrading and chain upgrading, increase GVC embedding degree. Third, China should accelerate energy technology innovation, promote the development of new energy, and accelerate the transformation of energy consumption structure. Last of all, China should implement industry differentiation policies, enhance the overall competitiveness of the high-tech industry, and achieve the “essential” improvement of the GVC position of the low-tech industry. At the same time, for all industries, China must improve the level of environmental regulation, increase R&D investment, and reduce the proportion of coal consumption and the proportion of state-owned enterprises. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",China; Embedding degree; Embedding position; Global value chain; Green growth

The current study examines the antecedents of consumers’ intention to co-create value that include consumers’ ethical perceptions constructs (i.e. privacy, security, fulfillment/reliability, shared value, service recover, and non-deception) and relationship quality constructs (trust, satisfaction, commitment), focusing on the digital sharing economy platforms. Methodology: Survey method was applied to gather data from n=348 consumers at digital sharing economy platforms. Structural equation modelling technique through Amos version 24. was employed in order to further analyze the data. Findings: Results reveal that consumers’ ethical perceptions as a second order construct comprising of privacy, security, fulfillment/reliability, service recovery, and shared value does not influence consumers’ intention to co-create value. However, relationship quality as a second order construct including commitment trust and satisfaction influences consumers’ intention to co-create value. Furthermore, relationship quality serves as strong full mediator between consumers’ ethical perceptions and their intention to co-create value. Originality: The studies on drawing relationships between value co-creation and relationship quality constructs have been popular yet to the authors’ surprise; seldom any studies have been conducted in examining the role of ethical perceptions in the settings of digital sharing economy platforms. Therefore, the current study closes this gap. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Ethics; Privacy; Relationship Quality; Sharing Economy; Trust; Value co-creation

A qualitative exploratory study was conducted, involving eight SMEs on an e-commerce platform in Ghana. The findings show that digital transformation among SMEs follows a four-stage process of digital technology initiation, changes to functions and processes, management of the resulting skills gap, and a strategic shift, which is also driven by managerial cognition, social capital development, human capital development, and organizational capacity building. These findings resulted in an inductivelyderived process framework for the digital transformation of SMEs that expands the knowledge and understanding of digital transformation for SMEs. The study also provides users of digital platforms with dynamic managerial capability strategies for achieving digital transformation and effective e-commerce platform utilization in developing economies, which are essential for research, practice, and policy.

As the introduction of Healthcare 4.0 (H4.0) usually implies in high capital expenditures and requires a more skilled labor force, such understanding gains relevance when considering hospitals in emerging economies, more likely to be resource-constrained. This study examines the effect of five contingency factors on the adoption of H4.0 technologies and associated barriers to H4.0 adoption in emerging economies; they are: hospital's ownership and age, number of employees, number of inpatient beds, and functionality (teaching hospital or not). The analysis is based on a transnational survey with 159 middle and senior managers from 16 hospitals, located in Brazil, India, Mexico and Argentina. Results indicate that contingencies do affect both H4.0 technologies adoption and associated barriers although not homogeneously in terms of effect, being more prominent on technologies’ adoption than on barriers to H4.0 implementation. Our study sheds light on these relationships, providing hospitals’ managers a means to anticipate potential issues and handle eventual difficulties inherent to the context in which they are inserted. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Barriers; Contingency factors; Digital technologies; Healthcare 4.0; Survey

Initially, impressed with critiques of the sudden ‘demonetisation’ on 8 November 2016, we conducted econometric research to test how banks (‘bricks’) could be brought closer to rural people. However, this traditional approach of envisaging more banks was rapidly overtaken by the massive uptake of digital payment methods (‘clicks’) in India since 2016. Partly driven by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), this has raised new concerns and research agenda focused on people’s trust in banking and new technologies, consumer skills and people’s basic rights vis-à-vis a state that, controversially, now seems to be seeking more control within a relentlessly changing postmodern scenario. © 2020 SAGE Publications.",banking; cashless economy; COVID-19; demonetisation; development; digitalisation; India; pandemic; trust
"Tidhar R., Eisenhardt K.M.",Get rich or die trying… finding revenue model fit using machine learning and multiple cases,2020,"Research Summary: While revenue models are strategically important, research is incomplete. Thus, we ask: “What is the optimal choice of revenue model?” Using a novel theory-building method combining machine learning and multi-case theory building, we unpack optimal revenue model choice for a wide range of products on the App Store. Our primary theoretical contribution is a framework of high-performing revenue model-activity system configurations. Our core insight is the fit between value capture (revenue models) and value creation (activities) at the heart of successful business models. Contrastingly, low-performing products avoid complex value capture (i.e., freemium) and misunderstand value creation (e.g., overweight effort). Overall, we contribute a theoretically accurate and empirically grounded view of successful business models using a pioneering method for theory building using large, quantitative data sets. Managerial Summary: Revenue models are critical for product performance. Yet, the high-performing choice is often unclear. We combine machine learning with multiple-case deep-dives to unpack optimal revenue model choice for a wide range of products on the App Store, a significant setting in the digital economy. Our primary insight is that high-performing products fit value capture (revenue models) and value creation (activity systems) to form coherent business models. Contrastingly, low-performing products avoid complex value capture (i.e., freemium) and misunderstand value creation (e.g., overweight effort and price). We also identify the importance of user resources, marketing, offline brand, and product complexity for specific revenue models. Overall, we contribute a framework for the optimal choice of revenue model and spotlight the revenue model-activity system configurations of successful business models. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",business models; machine learning; mobile application products (apps); multi-case theory building; revenue models

Extant literature on the sharing economy has been predominantly concerned with Uber and Airbnb. As little is known about where the sharing economy is gaining momentum beyond transportation and accommodation, the purpose of this paper is to map in what sectors of the economy it is perceived to gain traction. Drawing on data from social and traditional media in Sweden, we identify a long tail of 17 sectors and 47 subsectors in which a total of 165 unique sharing-economy actors operate, including sectors such as on-demand services, fashion and clothing, and food delivery. Our findings therefore point at the expanding scope of the sharing economy and relatedly, we derive a set of implications for firms. © 2018 The Authors",Airbnb; Digital disruption; Long tail; Sharing economy; Social media analytics; Uber

A comprehensive literature review, followed by discussions with industry experts, identifies 15 barriers, which are analyzed by means of a Grey Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) approach. The ‘lack of a digital strategy alongside resource scarcity’ emerges as the most prominent barrier in both developed and developing economies. The influencing barriers identified suggest that improvements in standards and government regulation could facilitate the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies in developing country case, whereas technological infrastructure is needed to promote the adoption of these technologies in developed country case. This study is one of the first to examine the implementation of Industry 4.0 in both developing and developed economies. This article highlights the difficulties in the diffusion of technological innovation resulting from a lack of coordinated national policies on Industry 4.0 in developing countries, which may prevent firms from fully experiencing the Industry 4.0 revolution.

Digital platforms appear to provide an alternative to certain aspects of precarity by helping workers find work consistently and securely. However, these platforms also introduce their own demands and constraints. Drawing on 20 interviews with online freelancers, 19 interviews with corresponding clients and a first-hand walkthrough of the Upwork platform, we identify critical literacies (what we call gig literacies), which are emerging around online freelancing. We find that gig workers must adapt their skills and work strategies in order to leverage platforms creatively and productively, and as a component of their ‘personal holding environment’. This involves not only using the resources provided by the platform effectively, but also negotiating or working around its imposed structures and control mechanisms. © The Author(s) 2019.",digital labour platforms; gig literacies; gig work; online freelancing; precarious work

However, the electricity sector is navigating major disruptions that are changing the regulatory and business landscape. This article focuses on the question of whether these changes would help or hinder electrification, taking transportation as an example. Like the electricity sector, transportation is undergoing a deep transformation. We suggest that businesses in both sectors will at some point offer aggregated services, repackaged as subscriptions, and traded on digital platforms. We also argue that data created by these activities would be so valuable that this could be reason alone to move toward this model. This could create synergies between companies that could eventually lead to a rebound effect of electrification, with more vehicle miles traveled and more electricity consumption than before. © The Author(s) 2019.",Digital platforms; electricity services; electrification; infrastructures; mobility as a service; regulation

"Alaoui L., Germano F.",Time scarcity and the market for news,2020,"We develop a theory of news coverage in environments of information abundance. Time-constrained consumers browse through news items across competing outlets. They choose which outlets to access and which stories to read or skip, thus indirectly deciding how much time to spend on a given outlet. Firms decide on rankings of news items that maximize their profits. We show that even when readers (or television viewers) and firms are rational and unbiased, they spend more time on the news than they would like and not necessarily on the topics they prefer. In particular, relevant news items may be crowded out. We then study how reader-efficient standards can be restored, and derive implications on diverse aspects of new and traditional media. These include tabloidization and polarization of the news, and other aspects relevant for the political economy of the media, including political knowledge gaps and voter turnout. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Digital media; Media markets; Political knowledge gaps; Ranking news items; Tabloidization of news; Time-constrained consumers

This economic cluster generally refers to entrepreneurship developed through the use of the internet and digital advancements to create business opportunities with excellence in the value of services and products. In strategic management, the development of technology that is widely adopted in company policy in improving service and product quality is an external element. In addition to having an extraordinary impact on consumption patterns, distribution and production, information technology is now able to become a fundamental instrument as the essence of creating value for products and services. This leads to a paradigm shift in the strategic management perspective, from the perception of technological externalities to internalities in value creation and policy making. This study seeks to identify shifts in the paradigm of the external environment of technology in contemporary business that develops ICT and the internet as the basis for digitalization and virtualization of exchanges of products, services and transactions between business actors. The results show that unlike conventional companies that respond to technological advances need technological advancements as an added value of their products and services, digital entrepreneurship uses technological advancements as a core part of product development and value creation. This study identifies important elements regarding adaptive strategies of external environmental effects in digital entrepreneurship. The results show that the shift in technological externalities to integrated digital entrepreneurship is capable of digitizing the creation of values and opportunities and operating digital-based businesses. © 2020 Fauzi et.al..",Adaptive strategies; Digital entrepreneurship; External environment; Internet marketing; Strategic management

This article uses data collected from a large number of Spanish agribusiness firms of the agrarian, agrifood and wine subsectors, located in rural peripheral areas or urban cores, to identify their images and positioning on social media. We use the Tagxedo digital tool to show the distinctive images of agribusiness firms on SM. Using the Howsociable digital tool and observing the SM key performance indicators (KPI), we measure the traffic and visibility of agribusiness firms on social media, and we find that a lot of agribusiness firms leave the potential of SM unused. The agribusiness firms upstream in the value chain and located in rural peripheral areas could take more advantages of SM visibility. We then create a model of image and positioning on SM using a binary logistic regression. We predict that more than two messages of sales per week on SM can diminish the visibility of agribusiness firm on SM. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",cross-areas location comparison; Image-positioning model; intra-subsectors analysis; social media agri-marketing
"Berg L., Slettemeås D., Kjørstad I., Rosenberg T.G.",Trust and the don't-want-to-complain bias in peer-to-peer platform markets,2020,"This paper addresses peer-to-peer (P2P) digital platform markets, often associated with the “sharing economy” or the “collaborative economy”. Such digital platforms, facilitating new purchasing channels for consumers by matching P2P supply and demand, can be considered new market places challenging the conventional markets. How are P2P platform markets evaluated by the consumers? Based on a comprehensive survey-data material, five different P2P service markets are considered by peer buyers and the results compared to consumers’ evaluations from similar conventional service markets according to trust, comparability and consumers’ satisfaction with the transactions. Comparability seems to be one advantage for the platform markets, while trust could become a problem. Conditions for trust in P2P platform markets is particularly interesting to study because contrary to conventional markets P2P transactions cannot rely on governmental laws, regulations and security net. This trust problem has been solved by a trust-generating rate and review system. Our data material, however, distinguishes a mechanism that we have coined as the don't-want-to-complain bias. More precisely, people do not like to complain, hence buyers of P2P services often hesitate to give negative ratings when they are discontent with a service or a supplier. Therefore, positive ratings become overestimated. If consumers recognize this bias, ratings and reviews will lose credibility and no longer be considered trustworthy. Eventually, this may threaten the well-functioning of P2P markets. © 2020 The Authors.

The building industry contributed to a large proportion of the global energy use and carbon emissions across material production, construction, operation and end-of-life. Utilizing computer simulation and optimisation to minimize the building life cycle environmental impacts has gained increasing attentions recently. There were researches on different kinds of computational optimisation in various contexts, but a critical review to identify and compare the optimisation approaches is still lacking and needed to demonstrate their strengths/weaknesses and to highlight the future research challenges. Therefore, the objective of this paper was to critically review the computer simulation and optimisation studies for minimizing the life cycle energy consumption and carbon emissions in buildings, with the aim of identifying the current practices and future research need in this field. The common research streams and methods (e.g., innovative structural systems and materials, energy retrofitting measures) were compared, with an in-depth analysis on the importance and benefits that come with their usages. Life cycle design optimisation with the consideration of production, operation and end-of-life of building systems has a growing importance for the sustainable development of the future towards resource-based circular economy. Moreover, emerging digital technologies (such as machine learning, data-driven design, and parametric 3D modelling) enable greater automation in early design exploration and advance decision marking in design optimisation. As human factors (e.g., energy-related occupant behaviours) become important metrics in the built environment, multi-disciplinary design should be adopted to generate social-technical solutions that encompass both environmental sustainability and human wellbeing. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Building structure; Climate change; Computational design; Energy conservation; Numerical simulation; Performance optimisation

"Strielkowski W., Volchik V., Maskaev A., Savko P.",Leadership and effective institutional economics design in the context of education reforms,2020,"Nowadays, the most typical reforms in higher education are conducted through the reorganization of universities either in the form of a merger, acquisition, or new status attainment. As a result, universities which educate local leaders for their respective national economies and have a profound impact on the regional economic development, as well as the composition of the labor market and intellectual potential, often encounter negative economic outcomes. The reforms that are imposed by the policymakers ""from above"" often hamper the development of universities and prevent them from fulfilling their roles described above. The process of reforming higher education in Russia is in many ways similar to the changes in the higher education systems of other European countries, in particular in post-Communist transition economies. Firstly, this process went through the integration into the global market of educational services. Secondly, it proceeded with the rethinking of the role of the university as a self-sustainable business organization. Thirdly, it was concluded by an increase in the demand and accessibility of education using the advancements offered by the digital technologies. Our paper argues that focused and well-balanced economic institutional design might be required for the sustainable development of reorganized leading universities. The project perspective implies that it is necessary to develop an institutional design in relation to what the organization seeks to achieve (either as its regulator or reformer) and how it intends to achieve these goals. In connection with the foregoing, we propose the following principles of designing effective institutions for the sustainable development of reorganized universities: (i) preservation of education as a ""mixed"" good (i.e., one that has the features of both public and private goods); (ii) transparency of decision making; (iii) complementarity of institutional change; and last but not least (iv) reduction in transaction costs. © 2020 by the authors.",Complementarity; Higher education; Institutional changes; Institutional economics; New public management; Transaction costs; Universities
Curran D.,Connecting risk: Systemic risk from finance to the digital,2020,"The 2008 financial crisis illustrated the potential for the failure of a single industry to threaten the functioning of the entire economy. By reconstructing the ecological approach to systemic risk, this paper argues that there are two key factors that enable this oversized risk. The first is the level of risk across the system, which is shown to be intensified in systems that exhibit interconnectedness, complexity, mismatches between knowledge and activity, and low redundancy. The second is the extent to which the system serves as a widespread necessary condition, that is a universal intermediary, for other social practices. This paper shows how these factors apply to pre-crisis finance and, how they apply to the contemporary networked digital economy, with potentially devastating economic and social consequences. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",digital economy; ecological approaches to systems; financial crises; systematically important digital institutions; systemic digital risk; universal intermediary

The focus of the study includes the behavior of all those in this market for information, namely suppliers (whether content generators, aggregators, packagers, or distributors of content) of marketing research, university staff, and students. The case study method was implemented to collect data. The case study focuses on UK Higher Education. Specifically, the authors use the case study of the newly developed Archive of Market and Social Research (AMSR) to explore how content relating to marketing and market research is distributed to and within universities. The research involved personal interviews with 15 librarian senior managers selected from 14 universities. The interviews with librarians provided insight into how AMSR could be distributed to university libraries and how it could be accessed. The findings highlight the role of university academics in specifying the content of marketing and market research. They focus on ‘real world’ management problems to deliver research with impact and relevant teaching. Therefore, they need company and industry information and are more likely to use current sources. The study maps the process of acquisition of marketing and market research content by universities and identifies the different roles involved in this process. The study is in line with the emerging literature that focuses on the role of education in explaining the relevance gap in marketing research. The study contrasts between the situation in the university market and industrial buying and adds to our understanding of the complexities associated with the distribution of the marketing research material. The result is expected to be a much sharper focus for the marketing of the archive material, leading to greater use of recent high-quality market research by marketing educators, and changes to marketing and market research syllabuses. This note provides insight into how suppliers (whether content generators, aggregators, packagers, or distributors of content) of market and marketing research should market to universities and ensure the use of their information resources by students and teachers and how they should. The findings of the study contribute to understanding customer needs and shaping a new service product proposition. In addition, the study provides insight into how university students and staff access and should access commercial research on marketing from the market research industry (in particular from the Archive of Market and Social Research) and use it in their learning, so that their knowledge will be more up to date and their employability will be increased. Adding several insights to the issue of distribution of marketing research material to universities. The paper relates to the marketing of information resources to universities, specifically to the work of the Archive of Market and Social Research, in marketing their information assets to universities, and more specifically the relationship between the “push” of suppliers, libraries, journal and textbook suppliers and information aggregators (such as EBSCO and JISC) and the pull coming from academic researchers and lecturers, who might use this information in their teaching and research.

Li F.,The digital transformation of business models in the creative industries: A holistic framework and emerging trends,2020,"This paper examines how digital technologies facilitate business model innovations in the creative industries. Through a systematic literature review, a holistic business model framework is developed, which is then used to analyse the empirical evidence from the creative industries. The research found that digital technologies have facilitated pervasive changes in business models, and some significant trends have emerged. However, the reconfigured business models are often not ‘new’ in the unprecedented sense. Business model innovations are primarily reflected in using digital technologies to enable the deployment of a wider range of business models than previously available to a firm. A significant emerging trend is the increasing adoption of multiple business models as a portfolio within one firm. This is happening in firms of all sizes, when one firm uses multiple business models to serve different markets segments, sell different products, or engage with multi-sided markets, or to use different business models over time. The holistic business model framework is refined and extended through a recursive learning process, which can serve both as a cognitive instrument for understanding business models and a planning tool for business model innovations. The paper contributes to our understanding of the theory of business models and how digital technologies facilitate business model innovations in the creative industries. Three new themes for future research are highlighted. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Business model; Creative industry; Digital economy; Digital technology; Holistic framework; Innovation; Portfolio model; Transformation
Feld H.,From the telegraph to Twitter: The case for the digital platform act,2020,"In The Case for the Digital Platform Act1 I argue that digital platforms form a distinct part of the economy that requires its own rules tailored to the unique features of the digital platform space, and its own regulator to police the sector. This regulator would have jurisdiction to promote competition, protect consumers, and address questions of content moderation. Rather than creating regulatory models from scratch, governments should look to the regulation of disruptive communications technologies of the past to evaluate what worked to promote values essential to our democracy and economy, and what did not work. With this experience firmly in mind, we can adapt previous regulatory models to advance our fundamental values for society. © 2019 Harold Feld",Digital platform
Bhimani A.,Digital data and management accounting: why we need to rethink research methods,2020,"Digitalisation is having profound effects on how enterprises function. Its impact on accounting research is growing as the rise of the internet, mobile technologies and digital economy tools generate depth, breadth and variety of data that far exceed what researchers have had access to in the past. But whilst social scientists interested in organisational issues are starting to question conventional methodological approaches to the study of contexts where digital data forms are drawn upon, little such concern has been voiced in the management accounting literature. This paper seeks to explore the continued applicability of conventional methodological thinking when carrying out investigations within digital data environments to inform management accounting studies. It considers why digitalisation impacts methodological precepts, identifies how descriptive and explanatory modes of questioning which management accountants have conventionally opted for need rethinking, discusses ways in which digital data characteristics alter what can be drawn from empirical studies, and points to the potential offered within digitalised settings for methodological advance. It concludes by highlighting the necessity, where digitalisation exists, to question modes of posing questions and to reconsider the applicability of methodological precepts deployed by management accounting researchers to date. © 2020, The Author(s).",Datafication; Digitalisation; Empiricism; Methodology
"Ranchordás S., Goanta C.",The New City Regulators: Platform and Public Values in Smart and Sharing Cities,2020,"Cities are increasingly influenced by novel and cosmopolitan values advanced by transnational technology providers and digital platforms. These values which are often visible in the advancement of the sharing economy and smart cities, may differ from the traditional public values protected by national and local laws and policies. This article contrasts the public values created by digital platforms in cities with the democratic and social national values that the platform society is leaving behind. It innovates by showing how co-regulation can balance public values with platform values. In this article, we argue that despite the value-creation benefits produced by the digital platforms under analysis, public authorities should be aware of the risks of technocratic discourses and potential conflicts between platform and local values. In this context, we suggest a normative framework which enhances the need for a new kind of knowledge-service creation in the form of local public-interest technology. Moreover, our framework proposes a negotiated contractual system that seeks to balance platform values with public values in an attempt to address the digital enforcement problem driven by the functional sovereignty role of platforms. © 2019 Sofia Ranchordás",Digital platforms; Internet-of-things; Privacy; Public values; Smart cities; Urban law

The Smart City concept includes several smart dimensions relating to the environment, mobility, the economy, governance, people, and living. This study explores the impact of Smart home dimensions on highly-educated students, drawn from what is known as the “digital native” population, one of the key components of the smart living concept. As digital natives are already engaged with the adoption of new technologies and sustainable development, we have postulated that they would be keen to use smart technologies in the home that could improve their daily life while preserving the environment. This study tests a scale developed to measure consumer perception of the Smart Home Concept (SHC) and the impact on “Performance Expectancy” and “Habit”. The model was built using some of the constructs of existing technology acceptance models, such as the UTAUT2 and TAM2 models. Based on our findings, digital natives seem ready to adopt the SHC and our results highlight the fact that Smart Home products could be targeted at this specific population. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Digital natives; Smart cities; Smart home; Smart living; TAM; UTAUT2

Furthermore, mobile internet is an essential tool for overcoming the rural–urban digital divide. With respect to agriculture, mobile internet can play a central role in information gathering as well as the implementation of precision and smart farming technologies. Yet, no study has identified the determinants of mobile internet adoption in agriculture. Using a bivariate probit model with a sample selection and a representative data set from 815 German farmers, this study showed that, among other characteristics, the age of the farmer, farm size and location, as well as familiarity with internet risks is associated with mobile internet adoption in agriculture. These results may be of interest to policy makers, who deal with internet infrastructure, and providers of farm equipment that rely on mobile internet connection.

"Medina L., Cano-Kollmann M., Alvarez I.",International connectivity in the generation of information and communication technology (ICT) in Spain,2020,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyze the characteristics of knowledge creation in a key technology field, i.e. information and communication technology (ICT), to determine whether it is driven by domestic firms and inventors, or whether the traction is provided by international connections to global innovation networks. The authors argue that the geographical pattern of international connectivity is characterized by local concentration and strong connections to foreign multinational enterprises, for which a large number of inventors in Spain work. Design/methodology/approach: The analysis was done using data from the United States Patent and Trademark Office database, covering almost 40 years, ranging from 1976 to 2014. The authors used patents in the ICT sector connected to either inventors or organizations located in Spain. The authors analyzed collaboration by the location of both inventors and assignees, and the connections established across borders. Second, the authors assessed the level of concentration and dispersion that characterizes these relationships. Findings: First, the growth of the ICT sector in Spain is strongly driven by linkages with foreign companies, in particular those located in the USA. Second, the interaction of local and international clusters of knowledge generation is a key driver of the ICT sector, which is far from being global. Third, there is a geographic concentration of national/international knowledge sources, which is mediated by the technological strategies of internationalized firms. Therefore, the new information age seems to be highly dependent on the collaboration between individuals and companies through focal local points, and on the prevalence of co-developed international inventions. Research limitations/implications: Understanding the patterns of ICT-related knowledge creation and its geographical footprint is crucial to foster competitiveness in the digital age. The transition from a paradigm based on tangible assets to one where competitive advantage stems mainly from intangibles, has significant implications for both policy and practice. International collaboration presents opportunities to enhance competitiveness at various levels, be that organizations, regions or countries. To seize these opportunities, it is key to enhance the endogenous capabilities and absorptive capacity of the local players. While patent data captures the output of a national innovation system only partially, it is still a suitable indicator to capture international connectedness. More qualitative-oriented techniques, however, may allow for a better assessment of tacit knowledge flows. Originality/value: The creation of knowledge in high-tech industries is a key aspect of competitiveness, and it is increasingly supported by collaboration that spans across borders. However, knowledge creation adopts different patterns, depending on the unique characteristics of the country. The authors analyze the case of Spain, a developed economy with pockets of innovation but also significant areas that can be considered “peripheral,” both economically and industrially, when compared to much of Western Europe. This study’s analysis captures the combination of concentration and dispersion in the process of knowledge generation that characterizes the ICT sector in intermediate countries. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",ICT; International connectivity; Knowledge sources; Patents

In order to explore these aspects and problematise digital nomadism, the paper traces the development of digital nomadism and takes inspiration from the Deleuzo-Guattarian image of the nomad. Adopting a qualitative approach to content analysis, this paper argues that digital nomadism is becoming increasingly institutionalised and professionalised, and, as such, is distant from the emancipatory dimension underlying its discourse and many of its cultural representations.

"Breytenbach J., Kariem I.",A Living Labs Approach to Manage Co-created Design Knowledge through Ideation Artefacts,2020,"With a Senian understanding of intellectual capital as being a function of agent capability and contextual resource constraints, the requirement for knowledge in the digital economy to be co-created by a network of agents is obvious. From network agents co-creating knowledge for the digital economy as a foundational point of departure, we problematize the management of this co-created knowledge. As network power shifts, so does the foundational capabilities and contexts. As demonstrated by the increased use of multiple stakeholder groups to co-create innovative solutions. These stakeholder groups are commonly classified as Triple helix, Quadruple helix, n Tuple helix. The problems caused by shifts in network power and agent capabilities become apparent in co-creative systems design processes such as Living Labs and popular Design Science frameworks. As the disruptive power of digital change creates shifts in the foundational design network's agency, knowledge is lost. We postulate that it is typically highly technical design knowledge - created at a high cost during co-creation - that is lost first. We present examples of technical design knowledge flowing out of the network from a local Smart Community design case. Towards the prevention of co-created design knowledge loss as a result of changes in the foundational network, we suggest the use of physical ideation artefacts for the storage, management, and continued dissemination of the knowledge within the network. We present a case study where local, co-created, technical, Smart Community design knowledge was stored explicitly as ideation artefacts called 'tech cards' and retained over time within the network after highly disruptive shifts in the capability set of the foundational agent network responsible for the original knowledge creation. The co-creation of physical, knowledge-rich ideation artefacts as part of system design processes such as Living Labs shows promise as a Knowledge Management tool (KMT) amidst fast paced digital change in the knowledge economy. © 2020 IEEE.",.co-creation; design artefacts; ideation artefacts; ideation decks; knowledge management tool; system design knowledge

Furthermore, our study suggests that mobile payment providers need to adapt their role within the ecosystem to scale the platform, and that it will depend on their choice of scope of geographic availability. Finally, we suggest that mutual adaptation of BMs of platform-associated actors leads to improved diffusion of the platform offer, which also hints at the need for researchers to revisit innovation diffusion and technology adoption theories by acknowledging the importance of the BM of the offer side of technology. © 2019 The Authors",Business model; Case study; Digital transformation; Fintech; Mobile payment; Platforms

Based on the results of the conducted research, the existing models of classification and evaluation of crypto assets are assessed, and the most problematic practical aspects of their application are highlighted. This made it possible to propose promising models for managing the value of crypto assets, containing the existing practices currently used by companies and their possible directions. It was concluded that the most promising way out of the conflict of interests of business and the current rules of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) is to refine the existing standards, introduce rules of classification and evaluation of crypto assets. The authors also do not exclude that the best solution is to develop a new IFRS standard for the accounting of crypto assets. © 2020 by author(s) and VsI Entrepreneurship and Sustainability Center.",Bitcoin; Cash and cash equivalents; Crypto assets; Economics; Financial instruments; IFRS; Intangible assets; Inventory; Recognition and measurement; Valuation models

Beaton-Wells C.,Antitrust’s Neglected Question: Who Is “The Consumer”?,2020,"In a period when debate about the goals, scope, and effectiveness of antitrust policy and law is flourishing, it is timely to revisit the fundamental question of whose interests these instruments are intended to protect. In considering whether antitrust’s primary concern should be with consumer welfare, few have paused to consider the nature of consumer identity other than through the narrow economic prism of the purchase and use of goods and services. However, consumers are not mere choosers of offerings in the market place, an identity itself riven by complexity and contradiction. Consumers act also as citizens and workers in markets. Recognition of the multifaceted and indivisible character of consumer identity promotes a richer more sophisticated approach to defining and applying a consumer welfare standard. The case for such an approach is illuminated in the context of the new economy in which the interests of consumer-citizens and consumer-workers are directly implicated by the challenges facing competition in digital markets. © The Author(s) 2020.",antitrust; consumer welfare; technology
Rust R.T.,The future of marketing,2020,"The main thesis of this article is that several long-term trends are reshaping marketing and forcing marketing managers to change radically to keep up. These long-term trends are technological, socioeconomic and geopolitical. Advances in technology, in particular, are having a profound impact on marketing, resulting in the deepening of customer relationships and the continuous expansion of the service economy. Artificial intelligence, big data, the Internet, and the expansion of networks are creating a revolution in marketing that makes the 1960s-style 4 Ps increasingly obsolete. Compounding the problem for marketers are the socioeconomic factors of diversity and inclusion, as well as major geopolitical threats. I explore the nature of change, extrapolate marketing practice into the future, and examine the implications for marketing managers, marketing education and academic research in marketing. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Artificial intelligence; Big data; Digital revolution; Personalization; Service; Technology
Rymarczyk J.,"Technologies, opportunities and challenges of the industrial revolution 4.0: Theoretical considerations",2020,"Objective: The aim of this article is to identify the impact of the Industrial Revolution 4.0 (IR 4.0) on the production processes of goods and services, their ground-breaking changes, and their potential economic, social, and political consequences. Research Design & Methods: The article was based on available literature and online sources. The discussion of the reviewed sources leads to the formulation of three research propositions. Findings: The technical progress that occurs in modern societies is divided into 4 phases called industrial revolutions. It is assumed that the current phase, i.e. the IR 4.0, began in 2000. It is characterized by the industrial implementation of breakthrough inventions such as the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, advanced robots, autonomous vehicles, cloud computing, big data, augmented/simulated reality, 3D printing, blockchain, nanomaterials, and digital twins. Implications & Recommendations: The sooner the inventions and technological phenomena of the fourth industrial revolution will be implemented by particular economies, the sooner the economic effects of this revolution will emerge in the global economy. Contribution & Value Added: The application of breakthrough inventions will cause revolutionary changes in the process of goods production and services, which are synthetically called an intelligent factory and an intelligent supply chain. In addition to the undoubted benefits of - primarily - technical, organizational, and economic nature, many believe that the IR 4.0 will bring threats in the form of rising unemployment, social stratification, threats to cyber security, violations of privacy, ethics, and social norms, a threat of wars based on new inventions and a growing division of the world into rich and poor countries. © 2020, Cracow University of Economics.

In this regard, waste management firms and policy makers are employing strategic approaches to waste management efforts by empowering relations among various stakeholders to innovate. Thus, customer and stakeholder value co-creation is one such strategic approach waste management firms can adopt to create value and to brand. Previous studies of co-creation in waste management are largely broad in perspective. The purpose of this study is, therefore, to assess the relationship among customer operant resources, online value co-creation and digital branding through electronic word-of-mouth in the Ghanaian waste collection industry. Using the positivist research paradigm approach, a structured questionnaire was used to collect data from customers through social media platforms. Hierarchical multiple regression was used to test the hypotheses. The relationships among customer operant resources, co-creation and electronic word-of-mouth were all significant. Customer value co-creation positively mediates between customer operant resources and electronic word-of-mouth. Firm web-based platforms also positively moderate the effects of customer operant resources on customer online value co-creation. The results of the study can guide management of the firms to design appropriate strategic and educational programs for the customers. This study has advanced knowledge on the importance of customer operant resources in waste management value co-creation by demonstrating the degree of impact of each of these customer resources. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Customer operant resource; Hierarchical regression; Value co-creation; Waste management; Web-based platform

"Michelini L., Grieco C., Ciulli F., Di Leo A.",Uncovering the impact of food sharing platform business models: a theory of change approach,2020,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the potential impact of food sharing platform business models and to identify the limits and barriers in measuring the impact. Using the “theory of change” (ToC) approach, this paper develops a theoretical framework that captures the activities, outputs and outcomes of food sharing platforms and links them to indicators. Design/methodology/approach: The study employs a two-step methodology, which includes a website content analysis followed by two focus groups. The purpose of the website content analysis was to list a set of activities that are performed by food sharing platforms. The focus groups allow to design the ToC and to discuss limits and barriers in measuring the impact of food sharing platforms. Findings: The study provides an overview of the main areas of impact of food sharing platforms (environmental, social, economic and political) and identifies the related outcomes. Furthermore, the paper highlights the need for the platform to manage the multifaceted tensions of food waste recovery vs prevention and the benefits of food recovery to helping hungry people vs the actual need to eradicate poverty by addressing social injustices and inequalities. Research limitations/implications: The selected sample involved in the focus group comprised a wide but not comprehensive set of stakeholders. Indeed, the obtained information cannot be generalized. In addition, the ToC approach requires a certain discretion of the facilitator and introduces the potential for partiality in conducting the analysis. Practical implications: The framework helps to unbundle the complex challenge of measuring the impact of food sharing platforms and it provides managers, practitioners and policy makers with a practical tool to direct their activities toward a better impact. Originality/value: From a theoretical perspective the study advances the literature on (food) sharing platforms and contributes to research on the sustainability in the food sector. It indicates the impacts a novel actor relying on digital technology can have in the food sector and points out the tensions between food recovery and prevention and the impact on poverty. The proposed framework could be a useful tool to support practitioners in understanding the trade-offs among the outcomes they aim to attain, and to identify the proper strategies to manage them. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Food sharing; Sharing economy; Social impact

The authors of this paper postulate that neo open innovation harnessing the vigor of external innovation resources which then developed into a new concept of R&D that self-transforms during an R&D process initiated by Amazon by coupling with users. The authors further develop these postulates by proposing the embedding of a growth characteristic identical to biological coupling. An empirical analysis focusing on the forefront endeavors of global bioeconomy firms and also by Amazon was conducted. A notable endeavor toward a circular economy initiated by its global leader UPM- Kymmene Corporation (UPM) demonstrated the significance of a coupling effect with downstream digital commerce leader Amazon. This effect can be attributed to harnessing the function of the growth characteristic identical to biological coupling through co-evolution of the dual coupling of bioeconomy and digitalization and of upstream and downstream operations. This co-evolutionary coupling is expected to provide a novel concept of R&D that grows its function in a self-propagating way during the R&D process. An insightful suggestion supporting to a novel concept of R&D in the digital economy is thus proposed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Biological coupling; Circular economy; Co-evolutionary coupling; Digitalized bioeconomy; Novel R&D concept

The research paper starts from the reality that finance plays an important role in each economy. Nowadays, finance has to manage and adapt to Digital Era. The purpose of this paper is an attempt to identify and encourage managing financial statements through artificial intelligence using XBRL and Blockchain. In many countries, financial and tax authorities encourage the adoption of eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) and Blockchain. XBRL enable business to generate their required reporting information directly from their financial data. Blockchain technology continues to grow and it is being used in more and more business sectors. Finance, accounting and auditing has been identified as areas that could greatly benefit the distributed registry and other features of Blockchain. The main benefits generated by these innovative tools include reducing the risk of error (especially human error); low risk of fraud; system automation, big data analysis, huge cost savings (by increasing the efficiency and decreasing in errors), increased reliability in financial reports, and reduced workflow.

"Tou Y., Watanabe C., Neittaanmäki P.",Fusion of technology management and financing management - Amazon's transformative endeavor by orchestrating techno-financing systems,2020,"Amazon became the world R&D leader in 2017 by rapidly increasing R&D investment. Its R&D investment in 2017 was double that of 2015, 5 times that of 2012, and 10 times that of 2011. This rapid increase continued in 2018, and Amazon accomplished a skyrocketing increase in its market capitalization, closing to being the world's biggest company. Such a rapid increase in R&D and subsequent market value has raised questions about how to conduct R&D and secure a large amount of funds needed for high-risk investments. Amazon has provided hypothetical answers to both of these questions. Amazon has been conducting innovative R&D to transform routine or periodic alterations into significant improvements during the R&D process and claiming huge expenses for such transformation activities as expenses for R&D. The company's ample free cash flow generated by sophisticated cash conversion cycle (CCC) management endorsed a large amount of investment for such a high-risk strategy. Increased R&D induced business advancement and lean cost structure construction leading to a further increase in cash flow has stimulated interactions between vendors, customers, and Amazon via the Amazon marketplace. Activated interaction-accelerated CCC advancement, a subsequent free cash flow increase, and user-driven innovation have thus simultaneously accelerated R&D transformation. All of these components - R&D transformation and technopreneurial strategy consisting of technology management, as well as marketplace development and CCC-driven cash flow generation consisting of financing management - function together as a consolidated sophisticated machine. Thus, Amazon has succeeded in fusing technology management and financing management by orchestrating all techno-financing systems. In light of increasing concerns regarding R&D expansion without the dilemma of a productivity decline that most digital economies are now confronting, this paper demonstrates the above hypothetical answers. Following the authors' preceding analysis of Amazon's unique technology management toward a new concept of R&D in the digital economy, an intensive empirical analysis focusing on the development trajectory of Amazon's techno-financing system over the last two decades was conducted. An insightful suggestion as to neo-open innovation that fuses technology management and financing management is thus provided. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Amazon; Cash conversion cycle; Cash flow management; Fusion; R&D transformation
"Demirgüç-Kunt A., Klapper L., Singer D., Ansar S., Hess J.",The Global Findex Database 2017: Measuring Financial Inclusion and Opportunities to Expand Access to and Use of Financial Services,2020,"Financial services can help drive development. They help people escape poverty by facilitating investments in their health, education, and businesses. And they make it easier to manage financial emergencies-such as a job loss or crop failure-that can push families into destitution. A growing body of research reveals many potential development benefits from financial inclusion-especially from the use of digital financial services, including mobile money services, payment cards, and other financial technology (or fintech) applications. Although the evidence is somewhat mixed, even studies that do not find positive results often point to possibilities for achieving better outcomes through careful attention to local needs.1 Many poor people around the world lack the financial services that can serve these functions, such as bank accounts and digital payments. Instead, they rely on cash-which can be unsafe and hard to manage. That's why the World Bank has made it a key priority to promote financial inclusion-access to and use of formal financial services. Measurement is key to understanding financial inclusion and identifying opportunities to expand it. In 2011 the World Bank launched the Global Findex database, theworld's most comprehensive database on how adults save, borrow, make payments, and manage risks. Compiled using nationally representative surveys in of more than 150,000 adults age 15 and above in over 140 economies, the 2017 Global Findex database includes updated indicators on access to, and use of, formal and informal financial services.

Some authors have predicted a sea change in engineering workflow through model-based systems engineering. Despite benefits, the prevalence of effective modeling techniques in industry is an open question. Massive open online courses and similar online offerings are a new opportunity to learn about industry practices. In this paper, we draw on data from the ""Architecture and Systems Engineering: Models and Methods to Manage Complex Systems"" online program from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which has enrolled 4200 participants, to understand how models are used in practice. We use aggregated data from questions to investigate model use by participants and their organizations. The results demonstrate that whereas modeling is widely recognized for its potential, the actual deployment against problems of interest is substantially lower than the participant-stated potential. We also find that many participants reported low use of basic modeling best practices, such as specialized programs. We propose that this research is a fresh use of descriptive analysis to uncover actual modeling practices. Future research should target more detail about modeling practices in engineering-driven firms, and the reasons why modeling adoption is low or overstated. © 2018 IEEE.",and government; Crowdsourcing; digital economy; education technology; improving research cooperation between industries; learning analytics; massive open online courses (MOOC); model based system engineering (MBSE); modeling; models for engineering; systems engineering; universities

Case study from Poland,2020,"The process of decarbonising economies has to take place on multiple levels. One of the objectives is to ensure renewables-based energy self-sufficiency of cities. Cities have become home to the majority of the world's population, and at the same time contribute enormously to environmental pollution. Considering the above, the purposes of this paper are threefold: to formulate a methodology for estimating rooftop photovoltaics (PV) potential in urban areas based on detailed Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) data; to calculate the spatial variability of load and photovoltaics energy supply, and thus to distinguish zones with various levels of energy self-sufficiency; and finally, to scrutinise the economic and environmental aspects of such a solution in given conditions. Wrocław, the capital city of the Lower Silesia voivodeship in south-west Poland (Central Europe), was selected as a case study. The city has a population of close to 650,000 and an annual electricity consumption slightly exceeding 2.2 TWh. Industry constitutes 46% of that demand, and households 31%. The results show that up to 850 MWp of rooftop PV can be installed in the city, which has the potential to reduce the electrical energy related emissions by almost 30% and simultaneously to increase the city's energy self-sufficiency. Although energy storage, in the form of batteries, slightly improves both the autarky and environmental indices, the relation between potential PV generation and load makes them very infrequently useful (mostly in summer) and not economically justified. © 2019 The Authors",GIS; LiDAR; Power system transition; Renewable energy; Self-sufficiency

"Montes J.O., Olleros F.X.",Microfactories and the new economies of scale and scope,2020,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the microfactory model, the elements that enable it and its implications. The authors argue that microfactories reduce the risks and costs of innovation and that they can move various industries toward more local, adaptive and sustainable business ecosystems. Design/methodology/approach: This conceptual paper explores several processes and practices that are relatively new; hence, it uses online secondary sources (e.g. interviews with CEOs, videos, blogs and trade magazine articles) extensively. Findings: Given its versatility and high automation levels, the microfactory model can fill the gap between artisanal and mass production processes, boost the rate of innovation, and enable the local on-demand fabrication of customized products. Practical implications: Currently, manufacturers generally need to make large investments when launching a new product, despite high uncertainty about customer acceptance, thus risking considerable losses. The microfactory model offers a safer alternative by allowing a firm to develop and fabricate new products and test their acceptance in a local market before mass producing them. Microfactories also enable the local on-demand fabrication of highly customized products.

Although Blockchain has become known for its support of crypto-coins (or crypto currencies), especially Bitcoin, its scope has become much larger, including businesses of relevant social impact. This paper presents an application of the Ethereum's Blockchain digital architecture for the solid waste management in a small municipality in the State of São Paulo, Brazil. This application comes to replace a paper-based current system. The current system uses printed cards called Green Coins, presenting vulnerabilities that should be overcome with the implementation of the new system. The blockchain-based system provides financial management for the collection of waste in the municipality aiming at better health and socio-environmental education and the financial and social inclusion of volunteer citizens, through the use of social currency. The proposed application uses social crypto-coins and security support through Ethereum's Blockchain, instead of the printed cards currently being used, including volunteer citizens, store owners and public agents. It should contribute in a relevant way to improving the quality of life in the municipality in relation to the typical aspects of sustainability: education, health, environment, social inclusion and local economy, contributing to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Secondly, a new set of assessment criteria is presented: Beside the carbon reduction potential, the energy demand and costs, additional criteria for the mid-term impact of a CO2 reduction strategy like the reuse potential or social acceptance are analyzed. In a third step, publicized data is converted into consistent system boundaries. Deriving from the life cycle assessment (LCA) the method “system expansion” is selected. The impact of the system expansion approach is demonstrated by calculation of the CO2 and the energy balances of the CCU approach within different system boundaries. The system expansion is visualized systematically under the consideration of the different processes. The Carbon2Chem® project is described as one example for the CCU approach of the steel and chemical production, which offers a CO2 reduction of about 50%. Additionally the CO2 reduction potential is expandable proportional with increasing utilization of top gases. A consistent level of the energy demand for the CCU approach is shown compared to the conventional production processes of steel and chemicals. © Copyright © 2020 Wich, Lueke, Deerberg and Oles.",carbon capture and utilization; carbon circular economy; Carbon2Chem; CCU; CO2 reduction; cross-industrial network; system boundaries; system expansion
"Dutta G., Kumar R., Sindhwani R., Singh R.K.",Digital transformation priorities of India’s discrete manufacturing SMEs – a conceptual study in perspective of Industry 4.0,2020,"Purpose: Manufacturing excellence is critical to our nation’s economy. Indian Government’s National Manufacturing Policy, drafted in 2011, is being revamped to include the aspects of Industry 4.0. Initiatives, both led and assisted by government and industries, are being launched to catalyze and transform India’s manufacturing competencies. This paper aims to study the functional areas which can potentially leverage Industry 4.0 technologies and help India’s manufacturing establishments to transform. It does so in context of the aspirations of India’s small and medium discrete manufacturing establishments (SMME) towards adopting digital technologies for the identified functional areas. The study draws its context from the relevant literature review intended to examine the academic articles published until the end of September 2018, followed by a maturity assessment survey of Indian SMMEs to establish priority areas Design/methodology/approach: The literature survey has been complemented with a maturity survey of more than 250 of Indian SMMEs to establish adoption gaps by comparing proficiency and sophistication of their present status and proposed adoption aspirations by 2020. The assessment of the organizational aspirations and gap areas identified is expected to indicate which of the Industry 4.0 elements can be adopted by them. Findings: The maturity survey undertaken throws up several insights – Indian SMME community’s self-assessment indicates operational measurements followed by manufacturing and design interventions as the aspired transformation cycle. The survey indicates that manufacturers would like to make changes to their design and manufacturing strategies based on performance metrics; therefore, they need to first capture real-time machine data, analyze and then incorporate the resulting improvements in manufacturing and design decisions in that order. Research limitations/implications: The maturity assessment method itself is in evolution stage, and future correlations with benefits will strengthen observations. Industry 4.0 being relatively new initiative for India, availability of country-specific academic literature is limited. The maturity assessment survey undertaken across organizations of North, West and South India therefore carries the risk of not reflecting the views of a wider population. The current maturity, or the lack of it, of proficiency and readiness of India’s SMMEs with respect to digital technologies may also be a barrier to self-examine. Practical implications: This research is expected to provide insight into priorities to be adopted for digital-centric transformation by Indian SMMEs. It is expected to facilitate policymakers and influencers from government and industry to help frame policies that facilitate the adoption of digital technologies by Indian SMMEs and facilitate India’s technical education community to adopt skill development programs to support industry. It is expected to provide guidance to India’s academic institutions to rejig their curriculums to help bridge the critical skills gap that exists between newly inducted engineering professionals and industry. Social implications: Digitalization is expected to foster lean and therefore support sustainability initiatives. Digitalization is expected to help create new, alternative sources of employment which are more relevant to emerging times and foster unlearning the past and relearning of new skills. This emerging diversity of engineering applications resulting from digitalization is expected to also support the larger and poorer agricultural community of India and help the sector to become more efficient and productive, which in turn will reduce economic alienation of a large section of Indian society. Originality/value: Industry 4.0 has been identified as the transformational initiative for India’s manufacturing competitiveness. Indian manufacturing sector needs to urgently implement the digital technologies and improve their performance and remain relevant in this dynamic market. This research will help guide them to frame their respective digital strategies and be successful. This research will help government and industry influencers to plan and execute their interventions. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Design; Digital; Digitalization; Industry 4.0; Integration; IoT; Manufacturing; Performance; SME; Transformation

"Wulf J., Blohm I.",Fostering Value Creation with Digital Platforms: A Unified Theory of the Application Programming Interface Design,2020,"While many firms in recent years have started to offer public Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), firms struggle with shaping digital platform strategies that align API design with aspired business goals and the demands of external developers. We address the lack of theory that explains the performance impacts of three API archetypes (professional, mediation, and open asset services). We couple survey data from 152 API product managers with manually coded API design classifications. With this data, we conduct cluster and regression analyses that reveal moderating effects of two value creation strategies (economies of scope in production and innovation) on the relationships between API archetype similarity and two API performance outcomes: return on investment and diffusion. We contribute to IS literature by developing a unifying theory that consolidates different theoretical perspectives on API design, by extending current knowledge on the performance effects of API design, and by empirically studying the distinct circumstances under which digital platforms facilitate economies of scope in production or in innovation. Our results provide practical implications on how API providers can align API archetype choice with the value creation strategy and the API’s business objective. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",API design; Application programming interface; boundary resource; cluster analysis; digital platform; economies of scope
"Jin J., Ma L., Ye X.",Digital transformation strategies for existed firms: from the perspectives of data ownership and key value propositions,2020,"The diffusion and embeddedness of cyber technology and big data technology is recognized as an opportunity and infrastructure for firms to innovate and transform. But which digital strategies existed firms in manufacturing and other traditional industries can make is still a question under research. The paper pursues to answer this question from the perspectives of data ownership and key value propositions. From the dimension of data ownership and key value propositions, this research proposes a research framework to guide the analyses of digital transformation strategy. The four firms are used to identify five types of digital strategies, namely new product strategy, new value-added service strategy, customized strategy, product embedded in the platform, and platform service / product strategy based on the framework of digital transformation strategy decision. This research suggests that a firm can select the suitable strategy considering his key value proposition and ownership of data which the firm could use. The research contributes to the research and practices on the digitalization strategy and the digital transformation of firms, especially those in emerging economies. © 2019, © KOSIME, ASIALICS, STEPI 2019.",data ownership; Digital transformation; emerging economies; existed firms; key value propositions

"Soja E., Soja P.",Fostering ICT use by older workers: Lessons from perceptions of barriers to enterprise system adoption,2020,"Purpose: Adaptation to the requirements of digital economy is especially difficult for older workers, which is a challenge for today’s organizations due to workforce shrinking and ageing. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to investigate how it is possible to develop older employees’ potential in technology use in the business environment. Design/methodology/approach: The authors examined how employees at various age perceive barriers during enterprise system (ES) adoption and use. This exploratory study is based on grounded theory and draws from the opinions of 187 Polish ES practitioners. Findings: With age, emphasis on employees’ perception of mandatory ICT implementation projects is shifting from technology to people-related considerations. For older employees, job security and workload appear the most critical issues in such projects. Age-diverse collaboration appears necessary to address the problems posed by technology-related and demographic changes. Research limitations/implications: The findings imply that incorporating multiple stakeholder perspectives and age-related considerations into research on ICT adoption appears essential. Practical implications: ICT adoption in the business environment can be successfully supported by age-balanced team building, cooperation between younger and older employees, and age-adjusted change management initiatives. Social implications: Supporting older employees during the implementation of mandatory business software should embrace reducing their negative attitudes to ICT-induced change by minimizing their perception of job insecurity. Originality/value: Unlike many prior studies, the current research places age in the central role and discusses not only how it is possible to support older employees, but also how to leverage their potential in the process of ICT adoption and use in a mandatory setting. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Age diversity; Barriers; Enterprise system; Mandatory information system implementation; Older workers; Poland

Authors determine the possibility of application of digital transformations in regional development. This is due to the fact that the Republic of Kazakhstan is a country with widely differentiated regional development. This means that regional development should be proceed not only from the application of digital technology directly within the regional economy, but also from the introduction of digital technology in certain sectors of the industrial complex. The novelty of the study lies in the determination of the possibility of implementing digital technology as an integral part of the economy and the possibility of clustering individual industries on the basis of digital platforms and communication technology. The authors provide mathematical justification of the integration model for digital complexes within various economy sectors of individual regions. Authors propose using the developed mechanism for structuring the current situation of regional economic development.

Mukherjee S.,Taxing the ‘Un’Taxed Digital Economy with a Focus on India: Decoding the Outsourced Holding Company Model,2020,"In the backdrop of the digital revolution we are witnessing, value creation through conventional production of goods and services is being challenged every now and then. These days, the digital economy, from entertainment to shopping, forms a crucial part of millions and millions, but its value added is slipping through our grasp. The fact of the matter is that sizeable shares of the value additions these companies do are moved out of countries where corporate tax rates are high to the accounts of companies in tax havens. This means that the productivity gains achieved through the digital economy does not necessarily translate into increased tax revenues for the government. The big names in the digital business market, at present, have been accused of paying virtually no tax in those populous countries where they operate. For example, Google’s revenue reached about US$74.5 billion in 2016 and yet Google is known to be subject to low effective rates of taxation and even accused of deferring taxes on revenues over US$24 billion only in the United States. Other European countries like Italy, France and others have proposed to tax the income of these digital entities but somehow it never materialized. At the outset, the paper presents a theoretical model to show how that liberal tax laws have always been attractive for shifting profits. In this background, the paper discusses the outsourced holding company model of tax avoidance used by digital business platforms like Flipkart with a special focus on India and hence decoding the tax design that can be operationalized by the fiscal authority to ensure increased tax revenues from digital value creation under such a case. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Corporate tax; Digital platforms; Google tax; Holding company; Transfer pricing; Value chain

"Maier I., Schiebel E., Schlögl C.",Digital communication networks during conferences on biobased economy,2020,"For quite some time, the emergence of the microblogging service Twitter enables to obtain fundamentally new insights about individuals, their behaviours and their relationships. Meanwhile, the social media application rose as a popular communication tool also at conferences. In this regard, an analysis of the Twitter network has a great potential, where new issues like the bio-based economy could benefit from. In the absence of any analysis in this subject, the objective of this study is to find out what kind of information could be obtained from the Twitter communication and to what extent Twitter data is suited for displaying and understanding networks. For this purpose short twitter messages sent during three different conferences were analysed. Based on conference-specific hashtags (a Twitter language operator) data collection and visualization were performed with the software NodeXL. Overall, 722 users participated in the conversations, creating 3294 connections. In the Twitter networks of each conference 3 to 5 large groups of users could be identified. Each network contained a small number of core participants. They were mainly individuals and institutions who actively participated in the conferences and thus were directly related to the events, whereas outside participants practically did not occur. Also some current and future applications and research areas in the bio-based economy could be identified. A thematic focus on basis of the microblogging data, however, was not always possible.

Fahmy H.,Is the sharing economy causing a regime switch in consumption?,2020,"The recent rise of digital technology has enabled the development of various online platforms that gave rise to the so-called sharing economy. Academics suggest that this economy is causing a switch in consumer behaviour. This paper attempts to test this hypothesis by fitting a smooth transition autoregressive model to the cycle of the proportion of e-commerce to personal consumption in the U.S. between 1999 and 2019. The analysis reveals that the sharing economy, driven by the diffusion of digital technology, is causing consumption to transition smoothly, but frequently, between two regimes between 1999 and 2013. In the later period, however, it displays a stable regime due to the slow diffusion of digital technologies over this period. We conclude that, indeed, the sharing economy is causing a regime switch in consumption, and the dynamic behaviour of this regime switching is consistent with the behaviour of the diffusion process of digital technologies. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

Surie G.,Adapting national innovation systems in a digital world,2020,"The rapid adoption of e-commerce, digital technologies and the globalization of industries has connected once isolated national innovation systems (NISs; Nelson, 1993; Lundvall, 2007) heightening both similarities and differences between countries. Digital technologies have allowed industrialized economy firms to take advantage of low-cost locations around the world to outsource manufacturing while retaining the research and development and other skill-intensive tasks in high-cost locations. At the same time, the rise of emerging economies like China and India and entry of emerging market firms has increased competition in the global economic ecosystem. NISs in emerging economies are concerned with raising the competitiveness of firms and industries while ensuring social and economic inclusion. Additionally, governments of both industrialized and emerging economies have focused on upgrading and adapting their respective NISs to facilitate innovation, critical for competitiveness. This paper uses NIS and complexity theories to develop a framework to understand how NISs adapt to remain competitive in a digital world. Two cases: the case of the US, a developed economy, and that of India, an emerging economy are presented to support the model and yield insights on innovation strategies.

For digital economy to grow to its utmost potentials, a supportive eco-legal system is warranted, both at domestic level and international level. As at the heart of digital economy is speedy access to Internet as well as latest gadgets, applications and data analytics, facilitating transfer of data from one country to another should be a matter of first priority. Whilst government seeks to achieve that domestically by introducing relevant laws and regulations, it is no surprise that international norms on data transfer is equally imperative.

"da Silva Albino J., Azuaga F.L.",Digital business models and collaborative economics,2020,"The adoption of digital tools to facilitate the business and the daily life of its users has long been adapted in people's lives. In the transition to the digital world, they gain the most innovative business models. The sale of products on electronic sites, meetings through interactive media are increasingly frequent. Most of the activities are done through a mobile device, where applications (apps) found fertile ground to develop and also be a way to present a new business, an innovative business. Thinking about Schumpeter's words, innovation must be disruptive, therefore breaking paradigms, changing concepts. New products, bold services, breakthroughs and more creative business models make the difference in the marketplace. And some entrepreneurs have turned their attention to an important niche market, focused on the relationships, and connections. The business verbs are to share, cooperate, divide and not just accumulate. This article will address this new relationship in which mobile applications are strengthening the digital business that has been explained by the concept of collaborative economy. Which means that through applications that are supported by communication technology and mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, with easy access, make a direct connection between consumer and supplier who are associated with a platform where they can communicate in an uncomplicated language. This is what has happened with the hosting system through “Airbnb”, or the new way of getting around, through “Uber” and a case created in Brazil, Dinner, which connects people who like to exchange gastronomic experiences with hosts that offer exclusive dinners in their own homes throughout Brazil. The subject discussed in this paper is recently and the research is focused on the experiences of the authors and organized in an exploratory and descriptive method to describe and explain the concept and characteristics of the object of this study.

We focus on cross-border Internet purchases, as part of the digital economy, the total value of which cannot be accurately estimated by using existing consumer survey approaches. In fact, they lead to a serious underestimation. To obtain an accurate estimate, we propose a three-step data-driven approach based on supply-side data. For the first step, we develop a data-driven generic method for firm level probabilistic record linkage of tax data and business registers. In the second step, we use machine learning to identify webshops based on website data. Then, in the third step, we implement recently developed bias correction techniques that have hitherto been overlooked by the machine learning community. Subsequently, we claim that our three-step approach can be applied to any European Union member state, leading to more accurate estimates of cross-border Internet purchases than those obtained by currently existing approaches. To justify the claim, we apply our approach to the Netherlands for the year 2016 and find an estimate that is six times as high as current estimates, having a standard deviation of 8%. Hence, we may conclude that our new approach deserves more investigation and applications. © 2019 The Authors Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series A (Statistics in Society) Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of the Royal Statistical Society.",Cross-border e-commerce; Digital economy; Machine learning; Official descriptive statistics; On-line consumption; Probabilistic record linkage
"Walwyn D.R., Bertoldi A., Gable C.",Building the hydrogen economy through niche experimentation and digitalisation,2020,"It is widely acknowledged that the current means of global energy supply have resulted in unprecedented levels of greenhouse gas emissions and that these approaches are not sustainable. As a result, the global community has adopted an ambitious programme of reform, known as the Two Degrees Scenario (2DS), to decarbonise energy supply. This programme has many technological challenges, including the storage of renewable energy and the integration of various forms of generation to ensure an efficient and reliable energy supply. Hydrogen fuel cells could play an important role in meeting these challenges. In this paper, the development of a hydrogen economy in South Africa is reviewed in order to understand how the country can transform its existing architecture and act to support a hydrogen-based technological innovation system. The research has shown that the hydrogen economy is still at a pre-competitive level and requires ongoing government support to ensure an energy transition is realised. In particular, it is important that the principles of niche experimentation, a proven strategy in respect of successful sustainability transitions, are further pursued if the country. Importantly, the net cost of hydrogen-based transportation, which is still several times larger than the cost of transport based on the internal combustion engine, must be reduced, especially in the key applications of public transport and underground vehicles. Furthermore, the development of digital technologies to manage supply fluctuations in energy grids must be accelerated. © 2020 26th International Association for Management of Technology Conference, IAMOT 2017.

Digital platforms that mediate service and work activities contribute to this. These forms of work ‒ known under the term crowdwork ‒ are accompanied by problems in the regulation of work. This article discusses the challenges of the platform economy for the stable and robust system of industrial relations in Germany. To this end, the characteristics of the triangular relationship on digital platforms for the mediation of work, the heterogeneity of platforms and the divergent forms of crowdworking are systematized. Even if their long-term relevance is often still uncertain, platform-mediated work confronts the established actors and institutions of industrial relations with new challenges. These challenges at the micro, meso and macro levels are identified and analysed in this article. Subsequently, the regulatory options are reconstructed from the divergent views of the various actors (crowdworkers, trade unions, state). Also, their scope and relevance for co-determination and collective bargaining autonomy are discussed. © 2020, Verlag Barbara Budrich.

The discussion of the marketing aspect suggests that mindful consumption and advances in technology have made sharing economy possible and increasingly popular. This has modified consumption patterns, particularly in the tourism industry, and has changed traditional marketing channels. It is further suggested, that the increasing prevalence of sharing economy practices is directly linked to increases in revenue and improvements in customer welfare and job creation. Moreover, socio-cultural characteristics of societies have also been linked to the provision and use of sharing economy. More specifically, attitudes towards innovation, sharing, trust and environmental sensitivity have been identified as socio-cultural factors that are expected to influence the provision of sharing economy services, and individualism-collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, power distance and the internet appear to be key behaviour determinant variables.

Fin-Techs are exerting a pervasively disruptive influence on bank business models. Notwithstanding the obvious benefits, analysis in this area from high-income transition economy remains unexplored. The paper exploits this gap via a drop/pick-up survey questionnaire administered on a sample of all 68 UAE-Federation of Bank members. The results indicate that digital technology is transforming the banking ecosystem from classical competitive models to innovative bank-to-Fin-Tech collaborative models, where classical banking is disintermediated into multi-modal, multi-directional and smaller models, generating opportunities never seen before, more so for overseas banks from developed economies. The sample period is short if we consider the frenetic pace of technological change, which may compromise the extension of the results to a wider population. The paper contributes to research on bank models by providing insights on how classical bank models are being transformed.

"Schulze T., Seebacher S., Hunke F.",Conceptualizing the Role of Blockchain Technology in Digital Platform Business,2020,"Digital platforms have firmly changed the way we interact within the last decade and, thereby, created an entire platform economy. Services and offerings on such platforms are typically facilitated by intermediaries. While blockchain technology can serve as means for creating a digital platform, it makes these intermediaries obsolete by creating trust through the system itself. Yet, blockchain is often referred to as “innovative technology in search of use cases” – a statement which indicates that a real-world impact of blockchain is still missing. This research, therefore, intends to address this gap with a taxonomy of blockchain platforms. It thereby aims to provide researchers and practitioners alike with a structured and holistic approach for studying practical use cases to allow for a better understanding of blockchain-based platforms. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",Blockchain technology; Digital platform; Taxonomy
"Pastuh D., Geppert M.",A “circuits of power”-based perspective on algorithmic management and labour in the gig economy [Algorithmisches Management und Arbeitsbeziehungen in der Plattformökonomie – Eine „Circuits of Power”-Perspektive],2020,"The bulk of contributions on digital business so far provide mainly descriptive analyses when it comes to the study of power-related phenomena within the gig economy. We particularly lack systematic, integrative studies which focus on interdependencies of power relations, labour conditions and business model efficiency, based on robust theoretical approaches which capture meso-level structures and micro-level dynamics of power simultaneously. Our conceptual paper addresses this gap by investigating power relations in platform arrangements, based on the framework of “circuits of power”. We use the case of the ridesharing platform Uber, which has caused debates in and beyond academia to illustrate how this framework, combined with concepts from labour process theory, behavioural economics and micro-politics, can be applied for a systematic analysis of the diversified portfolio of power-related control and influence mechanisms that are embedded in platforms’ software infrastructures. Departing from this, we examine how our approach can inform future research focused on assessing specific forms of management, organisation and work in the wider gig economy. Our discussion concentrates on a) the classification and comparison of heterogeneous forms of gig work; b) the assessment of labour-related problems; and c) power-related organisational dynamics or inertia in such settings. The latter point is related to the central question of why employee voice and resistance are rare in certain gig-work arrangements. © 2020, Verlag Barbara Budrich.

Rangone A.,Innovation and Technology: The Age of the Digital Enterprise,2020,"With the digital age, the concept of technology has undergone powerful changes that lead to a reconsideration of all the criteria with which companies can actually implement innovation. Compared to the last century, the tools available to the company have changed widely but, above all, the managerial strategies that can be used to follow a path of innovation and development have changed. This chapter therefore analyzes the resources available today, such as human capital, represented according to criteria of classification by sector competence, access to new technologies, the digitization of processes, the principles of e-business, and the use of the Internet. The statistics compiled at European level by the Digital Economy and Society Index already show clear disparities in the use of these essential tools for the technological and innovative development of businesses. Therefore, this classification shows how the gaps present today between countries in terms of diffusion of technological resources on the market are closely related to the intuition of companies to adopt them and be able to manage them. From this assumption, the section has the opportunity to further highlight the diffusion levels of the so-called techno–corporate gap. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",
Hämäläinen M.,A Framework for a Smart City Design: Digital Transformation in the Helsinki Smart City,2020,"Recently, there has been substantial interest in the concept of a smart city, as it has been a viable solution to the dilemmas created by the urbanization of cities. Digital technologies—such as Internet-of-Things, artificial intelligence, big data, and geospatial technologies—are closely associated with the concept of a smart city. By means of modern digital technologies, cities aim to optimize their performance and services. Further, cities actively endorse modern digital technologies to foster digitalization and the emergence of data-based innovations and a knowledge economy. In this paper, a framework for a smart city design is presented. The framework considers a smart city from the perspective of four dimensions—strategy, technology, governance, and stakeholders. The framework is complemented with sub-dimensions, and the purpose of this framework is to strengthen the governance and sustainability of smart city initiatives. Further, the proposed framework is applied to the Helsinki smart city, the capital of Finland. The objective is to analyse the Helsinki smart city through dimensions presented in the framework and learn how the city of Helsinki governs and implements its smart city initiatives. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",Digital technology; Open data; Smart city; Stakeholders; Strategy; Technology experimentations
"Corrales Compagnucci M., Kono T., Teramoto S.",Legal Aspects of Decentralized and Platform-Driven Economies,2020,"The sharing economy is sprawling across almost every sector and activity around the world. About a decade ago, there were only a handful of platform-driven companies operating on the market. Zipcar, BlaBlaCar and Couchsurfing among them. Then Airbnb and Uber revolutionized the transportation and hospitality industries with a presence in virtually every major city. “Access over ownership” is the paradigm shift from the traditional business model that grants individuals the use of products or services without the necessity of buying them. Digital platforms, data and algorithm-driven companies as well as decentralized blockchain technologies have tremendous potential. But they are also changing the “rules of the game.” One of such technologies challenging the legal system are AI systems that will also reshape the current legal framework concerning the liability of operators, users and manufacturers. Therefore, this introductory chapter deals with explaining and describing the legal issues of some of these disruptive technologies.

The factors which define the scope of world agricultural production are identified. It has been stated that at present a wide use of digital technologies is a key trend of the world economy of the last decade. World leaders in digital technology application are IT-companies, media, finance and insurance. The level of digitalization is much lower in true production and logistics. Agriculture is the last in the list. Basic components of digital infrastructure in the country were analyzed: telecommunication, geo-informational and mobile telecommunication. A successful experience in the introduction of updated financial technologies, oriented mostly on small agribusiness, farmers, was studied. It has been established that a branch standard in agriculture has to be the use of the system of geo-positioning, complex management of a machinery fleet, precise agriculture. A comparative analysis of the technology efficiency was made: aeroponics, hydroponics, traditional agriculture. The world market forecast of agricultural drone sales was presented. Major principles of the policy of “Ukraine’s digitalization” were identified. Five key components which constitute “digital” economy and, in turn, are in the center of “Digital agenda of Ukraine-2020” are suggested. The example of the support of the development of digital technologies and the initiatives of the EU concerning the development of digital economy was presented. The problems of the adaptation of Ukraine’s logistic projects to the world digital infrastructure were studied. Purpose of the article are: to determine the key factors that determine the transition of domestic agricultural production to digital agriculture; to form the tendencies of integration of local actors of the agro-industrial complex to the international digital infrastructure, to define measures for minimizing risks in digital logistics.

Drawing on the motivations and lived experiences of 31 Uber drivers in Toronto, Canada, we provide insights into three groups of Uber drivers: (1) those that are driving part-time to earn extra money in conjunction with studying or doing other jobs, (2) those that are unemployed and for whom driving for Uber is the only source of income, and (3) professional drivers, who are trying to keep pace with the durable digital landscape and competitive marketplace. We emphasize the ways in which each driver group simultaneously acknowledges and rejects their own precarious employment by distancing techniques such as minimizing the risks and accentuating the advantages of the driver role. We relate these findings to a broader discussion about how driving for Uber fuels the traditional capitalist narrative that working hard and having a dream will lead to advancement, security and success. We conclude by discussing other alternative economies within the sharing economy. © The Author(s) 2018.",Digital platforms; lived experiences; postcapitalism; sharing economy; Uber

Nelson-Field K.,The attention economy and how media works: Simple truths for marketers,2020,"In a world of fake news, fast facts and seriously depleted attention stamina, this book offers a considered voice on the advertising chaos that colours our rapidly changing media environment. Rather than simply herald disruption, Karen Nelson-Field starts an intelligent conversation on what it will take for businesses to win in an attention economy, the advertising myths we need to leave behind and the scientific evidence we can use to navigate a complex advertising and media ecosystem. This book makes sense of viewability standards, coverage and clutter; it talks about the real quality behind a qCPM and takes a deep dive into the relationship between attention and sales. It explains the stark reality of human attention processing in advertising. Readers will learn how to maximise a viewer’s divided attention by leveraging specific media attributes and using attention-grabbing creative triggers. Nelson-Field asks you to pay attention to a disrupted advertising future without panic, but rather with a keen eye on the things that brand owners can learn to control. Karen Nelson-Field is the Founder and Executive Director of Amplified Intelligence and Professor of Media Innovation at The University of Adelaide, Australia. Karen is a globally acclaimed researcher in media science, is a regular speaker on the major circuits, and has secured research funding from some of the world’s largest advertisers.

New industries which bring new developments into economies such as new products and concepts are called emerging industries. There are several difficulties an emerging industry faces while entering into a market such as high costs, uncertainty, complexity, and instability. Traditional marketing may not be effective enough in these industries to deal with these difficulties due to the ongoing transformation in the technology and digital marketing.

Greggi M.,Rise and decline of the Westphalian principle in taxation: The web tax case,2020,"The article analyses the crucial impact that the digital economy is having on international taxation and argues that the traditional taxing rules are inadequate to address the way that multinational enterprises are conducting business on the Internet and how value is created on the Web. The cornerstone of this analysis consists of the observation that, while the power of the states to tax is intrinsically connected to territory (thus, to a physical element), the Internet economy is not as it takes places in a virtual space (a Terra Incognita) which is, in legal terms, still uncharted. This situation is challenging the intimate connection between the power to tax and the territory state Sovereignty can be exercised on, superiorem non recognoscens. This is the Westphalian Principle, as commonly understood in History, and it is the pillar states have been built on since the mid-seventeenth century, in Europe. This article eventually considers the most recent development to overtake this empasse, in particular, the digital tax proposal as suggested by the European Commission in 2018.

This article examines some of the ways in which these themes coalesce, and interrogates the conceptual boundaries of sexualized labour, extending beyond traditional organizational settings and into Web 2.0. The study explores performances of sexualized labour on social media by analysing visual and textual content from 172 female influencers on Instagram. This article contributes to the literature on sexualized labour in three ways. First, by demonstrating how sexualized labour is enacted across various forms of influencer labour, and how this relates to the attention economy and monetization. Second, by developing the extant conceptualization of sexualized labour and introducing connective labour as a required element to mobilize sexualized labour. Third, by opening up a critical analysis of what is meant by ‘sexualized' labour within a cultural context of pornographication. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",influencers; Instagram; prosumption; sexualization; sexualized labour

Tourists and learners of different time and space can participate in sightseeing activities through the Internet, resulting in changes in sightseeing styles, which not only change the presentation of knowledge, but also change the way of learning information exchange, and the sightseeing environment also. Therefore, the real environment of the traditional classroom is extended to the networked virtual world of learning. As far as users are concerned, the biggest difference in sightseeing websites lies in the learning mode provided by the entire network sightseeing. However, it can be roughly divided into two different types: (1) established by the enterprise organization and (2) required to be charged. Courses and websites can be established by school units. Online tourism is a new type of education derived from the digital revolution and 4IR. The vigorous development in the country is also an important way for the government to achieve the goals of ""lifelong learning"" and its ""knowledge economy"" policy. The industry believes that the most important projects it must be involved in are: (a) establishing its own leading position in online tourism expertise (b) using learner feedback as a basis for improving network tourism (c) continuing research and development to expand the capabilities of the network sightseeing platform; scholars believe that the most Important projects are: (a) the establishment of a school network sightseeing unit (b) to improve the interaction between the tourism network and the visitors (c) to provide a variety of course contents.

Sergeyeva N.V.,The Cost Planning and Cash Limits for Repair and Maintenance Work in the AIC,2020,"The effective functioning of the agro-industrial complex (AIC) mostly depends on the structure and size of the costs of the formation and operation of the engineering production base. In agriculture, the agronomic terms of technological operations, the complexity of production, the quality of the resulting product, and its cost depend on the state of the technical means. A significant share of the cost of agricultural products is the cost of operating machinery and equipment. The optimization of these costs is based on a rational distribution of repair and maintenance work between the levels of the repair base of the regional agro-industrial complex. The paper focuses on the methodology of cost planning and identifies the technologies for optimizing the distribution of repair work. The task of optimizing the distribution of repair and maintenance work, taking into account the specialization of the repair and maintenance base of the district, is to take down the total reduced costs by type of work. The objective function that allows solving the problem of optimizing the process of servicing equipment is proposed. The cost limits for the main types of repair and maintenance work are determined by the example of the economy of the Rostov region. The techniques for indexing costs in planning, which will more accurately reflect costs taking into account inflationary processes and other economic changes, are proposed. The distribution of the repair work by enterprises of various levels has been completed. The obtained results allow us to substantiate the production parameters and structure of the repair and maintenance facilities of a specific administrative region. The creation of information databases, scheduling, and aggregation of data flows for regulating end-to-end production processes on the current state of agricultural machinery, and upcoming periodic maintenance will increase the speed of response to failures and machine downtime, increase labor productivity, thereby becoming the basis for making operational decisions. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",Digital economy; Enterprises; Infobases; Information and communication technology; Maintenance works; Mechanized work; Optimization; Planning; Repair and maintenance base

Although this has been fruitful for the country especially in the age of digital economy, it is also disturbing to note that social media has turned into a ‘nesting ground’ to spread lies and rumours. False content had caused confusion and misunderstanding – especially when public interest is at stake. Some tarnishes the good name of not only country’s leaders but also government officials. Hence, this paper analyses legal framework on regulation of false content online in Malaysia and selected jurisdictions. In particular, three recent initiatives were also highlighted, namely (1) introduction of a website – ‘Sebenarnya.my’ designed to verify authenticity of news; (2) emplacing liability on WhatsApp group administrator to monitor false content; and enactment of the Anti-Fake News Act 2018. The extent of how far these new initiatives to effectively curb the spread of false content is yet to be seen. Nevertheless, the paper records some key observations, issues and challenges concerning the three initiatives.

"Huber F., Wainwright T., Rentocchini F.",Open data for open innovation: managing absorptive capacity in SMEs,2020,"Open Data (OD) utilisation has been encouraged by governments because of its potential to fuel digital innovation. Despite this, there is a paucity of study into the role of OD for SMEs, in contrast to the growing literature that has focused on the collection and sharing of OD by the public sector. As such, our study contributes to open innovation research by analysing the main capabilities needed to overcome existing barriers to successfully manage OD in SMEs. Building upon the recent SME-oriented OI literature and adopting an interpretative absorptive capacity framework, we analyse the data collected from 30 semi-structured interviews with experts working in UK organisations adopting OD-based OI strategies. We find a number of core factors that shape OD acquisition, assimilation, transformation and exploitation by SMEs. Results show that without the specific OD capabilities identified in our study, it will be difficult for SMEs to successfully use OD, which may explain why the uptake of OD by SMEs more broadly has so far been limited. These unique OD capabilities need to be better developed by OD using SMEs, if this ‘raw material’ for the digital economy is to be fully exploited. © 2018 RADMA and John Wiley & Sons Ltd",

Being an industry of people, it directly depends on the performance of activities, skills, professionalism, quality and competitiveness, so it is essential to answer with precise planning politics which should be the most approximated ones to the real needs of the sector. In Portugal, the tourism sector continues to reinforce its importance in society and in the national economy since it remains the main exporting economic sector. On the other hand, the main challenge of this sector is qualifying and increasing the level of qualification of its workers due to their inadequate level of qualification, since 50% of the employed population in this sector has a primary education level. Therefore, it has defined, in its public policies, the goal of duplicating, in the next decade, the number of employees with high school education qualifications. In this sense, once skills are becoming the global currency of the 21st century, this study aims to feature the main soft skills that touristic human resources should hold, based on the importance given to them by the national entrepreneurs of the sector. This study is based on a sample of 555 answers and used a qualitative methodology throughout a profound review of the literature as well as a quantitative methodology where an online survey was implemented, expecting to develop the ideal profile of the tourism human resources.

Rangone A.,Introduction to the Corporate Innovation Management,2020,"The aim of this book is to investigate and understand the way in which the innovation capacity of enterprises is manifested and, as a direct consequence, what connection exists between the development of innovation at macroeconomic and microeconomic levels. This objective is achieved by the author on the basis of substantial evidence: although the main European countries have pursued similar economic development among themselves, the indicators of some countries—in this case, the parameters already identified in the Global Innovation Index are considered—express a much greater innovative potential than the others. For what reason? What are the forces in place that stimulate these trends? Through the analysis of these indicators as well as of the evident results obtained by international organizations (DESI, GII) but above all from the experience of economic giants such as the USA that have guided the technological progress of the twentieth century, the author thus has the opportunity to express a completely new point of view. The evidence presented in this work helps to demonstrate that the technological gap existing in the twentieth century between the European countries and the USA and which today already characterizes a considerable gap between the European countries themselves in the digital economy has been and is currently the reflection of corporate criticality in terms of innovation, defined in this work as a techno–corporate gap. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",

The mediation and organization via platforms seems to replace a workplace specific structuring of crowdworkers’ working conditions. However, this is only partially the case. Based on relational inequality theory this paper emphasizes that the design of crowdsourcing and crowdworking is part of negotiation processes within work organizations with specific inequality regimes which comprise different consequences for regular employees as well as crowdworkers. On the one hand, this applies to the question whether employees within work organizations are substituted or threatened in their work gratifications by crowdsourcing, or whether crowdwork supports existing processes in the work organization. On the other hand, it concerns whether crowdworkers are exploited by work organizations, or whether crowdwork is an alternative form of employment that fits to certain life stages and patterns. © 2020, Verlag Barbara Budrich.

Thus, this study aimed to analyze the kinematic aspects of RMU, performed by a former gymnast both with and without the gymnastics based style. Methods: A former gymnast with a successful transition to MMT, carried out RMU using two movement patterns: 1) close to the classical artistic gymnastics pattern (""Front uprise""), and 2) close to that used by many athletes not from gymnastics.

Hip and ankle displacement, velocity and acceleration were recorded and analyzed. Results: The execution of RMU was faster and the hip vertical displacement was greater when RMU was carried out with a gymnastics-based style, while ankle displacement path, peak velocity and acceleration were lower. Conclusion: The use of a gymnastics-based style to carry out RMU seems to be advantageous from the biomechanical point of view, favoring the performance of RMU. © 2020 Central European Journal of Sport Sciences and Medicine.

"Banerjee R., Majumdar S.",Determinants of shareholder value creation – platform versus traditional business models,2020,"The digital era has given an opportunity to other businesses to disrupt the traditional markets and migrate to platform models to make them more relevant in today’s digitalised economy. The value created in platform model is multi-way where a consumer and a producer continually switch roles, which is unlike the linear value creation model of a traditional company. This research contributes to the literature on shareholder value creation by analysing the effect of traditional accounting based and economic based measures on value for platform and traditional business model companies, aimed at identifying and presenting the financial performance (profitability) measures relevant to these two contrasting business models. The study includes a sample of 14 heterogeneous companies selected from the top 100 largest public companies in the world by market value, from 2008–2017. Using panel data analysis, we find that accounting based measures performed better than economic based indicators of value as measured by stock returns. Growth in earnings per share (EPS) was the best value driver for both platform model and traditional firms. Dividends per share (DPS) and return on equity (ROE) were also found to be significant indicators of value creation for traditional model companies, whereas for platform model, the effect of DPS was insignificant.

Endraria,The role of the supply chain managaemnt in accounting information systems in the industrial revolution 4.0,2020,"Utilization of Supply Chain Management (SCM) practice by businesses has a number of consequences for internal management information systems. The fourth industrial revolution will have a monumental impact on the global economy, so vast and multifaceted that it makes it hard to disentangle one particular effect from the next. Indeed, all the big macro variables one can think of GDP, investment, consumption, employment, trade, inflation and so on will be affected. This paper contributes to discussion concerning the desirability of improving external reporting and audit assurance by identifying and reporting internally generated qualitative SCM information that is critical to achievement of business objectives. The impact that the fourth industrial revolution will have on economic growth is an issue that divides economists. On one side, the techno pessimists argue that the critical contributions of the digital revolution have already been made and that their impact on productivity is almost over. In the opposite camp, techno-optimists claim that technology and innovation are at an inflection point and will soon unleash a surge in productivity and higher economic growth. Strategic management processes in place in almost all businesses already produce vital strategic information related to continuous analysis and monitoring of environmental issues including those relevant to SCM. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.",Accounting information systems; Industrial revolution 4.0; Role of the accountant professional; Supply chain management
"Nomani M.Z.M., Hussain Z.",Innovation technology in health care management in the context of Indian environmental planning and sustainable development,2020,"Innovation technology in health care management is a significant challenge to the right to health and life. Access and affordability to healthcare have been a daunting task because of rising costs, case management, and adjudicating medical claims. We often contend to a status quoits society that adopts proven systems and technologies and depriving ourselves of the potential benefits of innovative technology. India ranks in the 60th position at the Global Innovation Index (GII) 2017 in the adoption of innovative technology. It continues to import over 75 percent of medical devices. The innovation technology in health care management by our indigenous companies is a distant goal post in India. Therefore, it is high time to rethink to evolve a robust culture of innovation and new knowledge creativity in the era of knowledge economy by tapping the potentiality of the existing resources for sustainable economic growth. The innovation technology in health care management has shown commendable results in the referral and pre-certification services, digital imaging, and electronic medical records (EMRs). The ICT enabled e-healthcare model in primary health centers (PHCs) of some states in India heralded an innovative health delivery model. Taken as a whole, innovation and technology drivers have a marginal existence in the Indian healthcare delivery system and urgently need a paradigm shift to augur inclusiveness and sustainable development. © 2020, Research Trend.

Kuzu O.H.,Mission and vision analysis of tourism faculties in the context of the fourth generation university model: The case of Turkey,2020,"The purpose of this study was to analyze mission and vision statements of tourism faculties in Turkey in the context of the fourth generation university. The study was carried out using a ""case study"" design. A document analysis method was used to analyze the current situation numerically. Data related to the study were acquired from the web pages of tourism faculties, which exist within the data source of the Higher Education Undergraduate Programs and Quotas Guideline 2019, Student Selection and Placement Council, Higher Education Institution. The data were analyzed using Excel and Maxqda software. Codes of mission and vision statements were coded on 6 themes and 12 categories that were determined according to the model designed for use in the study. According to the study results, it was observed that the number of codes related to education mission was superior in mission and vision statements of the tourism faculties. However, in mission and vision statements, it was found out that there has been insufficient emphasis on a pro-active focus and contribution to the local sector and economy, which is the most vital success component of the fourth generation university. Furthermore, it was observed that tourism faculties lack strategy in terms of mission and vision visuals concerning a research-oriented university approach and digital transformation. Findings were assessed in the context of the discussions in the literature and suggestions were then made for future studies. © 2020 AJHTL /Author/s.",Case study; Mission; The fourth generation university; Tourism faculties; Vision
Botha A.P.,Machine innovation - A future reality?,2020,"As digitalisation and machine intelligence are rapidly emerging towards disruptive status, the question should be asked whether humans will or should remain in control of innovation? Often people think of artificial intelligence substituting humans, but huge value is going to come from the new goods, services and innovations artificial intelligence will enable. The 4th Industrial Revolution; the Internet of Things; smart everything, from wearables to cities; and artificial intelligence are future waves that will change forever the world as we know it today. We tend to think that future “smartness” is only possible through the creative abilities that humans have. But as machines are entering the workplace and our daily lives, not only as static robots on a manufacturing line, but as intelligent systems with the potential to replace lawyers and accountants, doctors and teachers, companions and partners, their role in innovation in complex environments need to be explored. Already, governments are considering introducing new systems for protecting intellectual property that is generated by a non-human entity. This means that the notion of innovation, which up to now has been an attribute of humans only, will have to be redefined to accommodate these new innovators of the cyber world. The evolution of innovation from a human-only initiative, to human-machine co-innovation, to autonomous machine innovation is explored in this paper. An analysis is done on the maturity of machine intelligence and human-machine relationships, to investigate the potential of machines becoming autonomous innovators. Innovation is dependent on the ability to recognise patterns, combine and integrate existing properties and knowledge to represent something that is perceived as new by the user, filling a gap in the market. This is exactly what machines are taught to do and teach themselves to do better in a conceptualisation era that follows the knowledge economy and takes us along into the algorithm economy. This paper presents a mind model to facilitate a better understanding of future innovation systems in the context of the complexity of the future digital world. It introduces a discussion, that should continue, on how individual innovation, enterprise innovation and community-based innovation may be supported by machine innovation and how national systems of innovation could well be replaced by a global machine innovation network in the future. © 2020 26th International Association for Management of Technology Conference, IAMOT 2017.

"Azzam M., Khalil T., Sami N.",Technology disruption for development and peace,2020,"Everything is going digital around us! Disruptive technologies and their disruptive use models are creating a new world and a different future. Over the last few years, the creation and utilization of technologies has played a critical role to improve the life quality of people, advance economies, and open new horizons for individuals, businesses, and even nations around the world. This is the bright side! On the other side, the world is experiencing nowadays exceptional technology disruption that has triggered an enormous change; a change that is behind the classical control of the governments and local authorities, and fueled by ongoing nonstop innovation and substantial evolution in the means people employ technology. Governments are usually are not aware of these disruption and its effects; even if they are aware, the structure of most governments is not agile enough to deal with such disruptions and governments are not fully taking advantages for such disruption to progress their nations and the whole world on the social and economic levels. Technology disruption is affecting seriously the markets, the governments, the organizations, the monetary system and the employment, and consequently is affecting the lives of the people. In other words, technology is disrupting the classical models on the economic, political and social levels. This is happening at a pace that could lead to an unprecedented advancement coupled with a complete chaos. Therefore, the role of the management of technology has become more vital and critical than ever. A role that should be seriously considered while thinking of the future model of governments. Based on that, the paper outlines the major technological trends, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Shared Economy Platforms, Autonomous Vehicles and Drones, and their possible effect on the economic, political and social levels. Also, the paper draws the future role of the management of technology, as well as the future model of government, in this regards to maximize the positive impact of the technological disruption and minimize the chances that could lead to the chaos. The approach used in the paper is based on thorough analysis of the reports issued by international institutions in the areas of technological disruption and its effect, desk research, and interviews with key personnel in the government, Business Representative Organizations (BROs), NGOs and private sector, in addition to youth, startups and entrepreneurs. © 2020 26th International Association for Management of Technology Conference, IAMOT 2017.

"Turovets Y., Vishnevskiy K.",Patterns of digitalisation in machinery-building industries: Evidence from Russia,2019,"Digitalisation in machinery-building is expected to enhance productivity and drive the digital transformation of other industries. The extant literature sparsely describes pathways of different sectors in digitalisation, considering the heterogeneous characteristics of firms and sectors. Emerging economies with important state participation represent a particular interest in this area of research. To this end, a multiple case study method was used to describe a set of determinants revealed from the literature on Russian technological development and innovation in manufacturing. Two different patterns were identified. The first one was typical for large leading firms with state participation, which have a global market presence and a substantial level of interoperability, currently turning into a service business model. Private firms that follow the second pattern focus on physical and digital infrastructure upgrading targeted at particular issues to secure connectivity across departments. The state participation does not have a decisive role in digitalisation decisions; however, it affects the participation of companies in national digital initiatives. This study is a preliminary analysis of the determinants associated with corporate digitalisation from the sectoral perspective. Since both national and corporate strategies are ongoing, it seems premature to make generalised conclusions. Instead, the paper provides useful insights for management and policy that refer to digital technology uptake by machinery-building industries. © 2019 Yulia Turovets, Konstantin Vishnevskiy, published by Sciendo.",digitalisation; machinery-building industries; Russia

"Singh R., Kumar J., Nayak A.",AGROY: creating value through smart farming,2019,"Learning outcomes: This case study outlines the marketing, strategic and organizational issues facing the ever-expanding agri-inputs market in India, through the perspective of Agroy – an agri-products company. This case can be used to assist in the teaching courses such as marketing management, rural marketing, business strategy, operations and logistics management, among others, for students of MBA or other specialized courses in management. The case has been developed to make students aware and to understand the arduous nature of setting up a company catering to the huge Indian agri-inputs market. This case delves into the complexities of marketing in rural India that is characterized by low technological awareness, low volumes of digital transactions and immense language barriers. The Indian agricultural market is huge and has undergone a considerable amount of change owing to competition among multinational companies and traditional local micro-retailers. This case discusses the various challenges faced by multinational companies in entering India and how they need to strategize to modify their Western model of a distribution channel which faces huge challenges when put to test in India. Specific learning outcomes include: the case study would help students to comprehend the new business strategies that an MNC could adopt in emerging markets. Some companies work on changing traditional and conventional value chains of activities to fit the emerging market customer’s best and hence companies needs to figure out a unique business model to compete in emerging markets. This case study gives readers the opportunity to think about strategy in an uncertain environment. The case illustrates the challenges associated with innovating new business ideas that would help the company serve a greater number of people from a diverse background. It highlights the importance of thinking about real options, a portfolio of projects and the type of organizational structure required to tackle the uncertainties associated with foreign companies aiming to enter the Indian market. It also explores marketing and distribution issues – which are the type of customers to target and which are the suitable geographic areas with suitable linguistic compatibility in which there shall be ease in doing business. Finally, it is an avenue for students to think about the changes necessary throughout the distribution channel to successfully implement and commercialize a project in rural India. The case is intended to work well as a learning tool for strategy implementation where uncertainty is inherent and as an application to lectures on real options and risk or for discussions related to marketing and distribution channels and its challenges. Case overview/synopsis: The Indian agricultural market plays an important role in India’s economy having a staggering 58 per cent of rural households depending on it as the principal means of livelihood. However they have very small landholdings, and hence, they find it difficult to order either large quantities or in bulk, as a result of which the cost of agricultural inputs gets enhanced. Agroy, an MNC, is one of the many companies that have stepped in to bridge this gap by trying to tap into the huge agricultural market. Agroy aspires to be the “UBER of agriculture.” Agroy is a cloud-based buying platform for farmers to buy agri-inputs efficiently at scale and at the best price from around the world. With big data and smart farming, the company aims to enhance farm sustainability and productivity. Agroy’s competitors like Agro Star and Big Heart also have similar business models and hence the competition is stiff. The three debatable questions that the case poses are: Will Agroy be able to shatter the age-old loyalty that Indian farmers have toward local retailers and other Indian companies that have an existing strong foothold in the market? Will similar distribution models as practiced in developed Western countries work in India, given the distribution challenges in deep rural Indian hinterland? Will Agroy be able to create sustainable business models by marketing agri-inputs at low prices in India?

"Guillemot S., Privat H.",The role of technology in collaborative consumer communities,2019,"Purpose: While some collaborative consumption activities are underpinned by commercial logics and dispositions, local collaborative consumer communities are organised around non-commercial values and driven by the desire to organise social relationships differently. These communities are based on the notions of a commons, sharing and reciprocity. However, because they make little use of digital tools (internet to coordinate the exchange of services, social media to communicate), they are not very visible to consumers. This paper aims to identify these non-commercial organisations’ relationship to digital tools and determine how these organisations can generate individual and/or collective well-being. Design/methodology/approach: This study examined the case of the local exchange trading system (LETS), a local collaborative consumer community that practices a moneyless exchange of services. A qualitative study was conducted based on 23 in-depth interviews with LETS managers. Findings: Due to the communities’ local roots and regular face-to-face meet-ups, there did not seem to be a pressing need to use an online platform to coordinate the exchange of services. However, the results showed that the use of digital tools increased these communities’ well-being potential (e.g. development of social ties, solidarity and social equality) while reducing their negative effects (e.g. fatigue due to community involvement and difficulty integrating new members). They also introduce the notions of generation, founder’s personality and management team’s dynamism into the collaborative consumption literature. Originality/value: It is important to focus on how these “alternative” markets function. Consumers use them but without abandoning more traditional markets. Understanding how they work improves the understanding of the competition they pose to traditional services and how the different ecosystems complement one another. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Charities and non-profits; Collaborative consumer community; Collaborative consumption; Collaborative economy; Digital tools; Local exchange trading system; Non-commercial services; Technology and service; Well-being
"Tsourgiannis L., Valsamidis S.",Digital marketing in tourism: why Greek tourists use digital marketing applications like Airbnb,2019,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the attitudes of tourists toward digital marketing applications related to peer-to-peer short-term rental services within the sharing economy in the tourism sector. It aims to identify the factors that make Greek tourists to use these applications and to classify them into groups according to their attitudes toward these websites and to profile each group of tourists according to their personal and demographic characteristics and their preferences regarding their holidays/travel. Design/methodology/approach: A primary survey was conducted in April 2018 for a random selected sample of Greek tourists. Principal component analysis was conducted to identify the main factors that affect tourists in using digital marketing application related to peer-to-peer short-term rental services within the sharing economy in the tourism sector. Cluster analysis was performed to classify tourists into groups according to their attitudes toward the use of these websites while discriminant analysis was conducted to check cluster predictability. Non-parametric tests, including the chi-square test, were performed to profile each strategic group according to their demographic characteristics and their preferences regarding their holidays/travel. Findings: The study classified tourists into three groups, i.e. pioneers, convenience seekers and conscious, according to their attitudes toward the use of such applications. Research limitations/implications: The choice for the Greek context of the research is justified by the fact that Greece has suffered from recession in the last decade, but it is also a tourism-friendly country. The empirical results of this pioneer study should trigger further investigation. Although tourists’ behavior towards the adoption of digital marketing application related to peer-to-peer rental services within the sharing economy in the tourism sector might be culturally specific and the results are mainly applicable in the Greek market, they could be generalized in other countries with similar characteristics in both Greece and other parts with similar characteristics. Practical implications: Tourists are extremely important both for developers and policy makers in tourism industry. For developers such information is important because the expectation of viable markets will motivate investments. For policy makers, this type of information will help them to respond more adequately through regulation tools and programs. From a practical perspective, the tourism operators may benefit from focusing on their differentiating features and aligning their marketing communication with their tourists’ aspirations by developing, optimizing and customizing their websites according to the needs of the customers and the extension of touristic activities to other sectors of tourism industry. Social implications: Visitors who choose Airbnb accommodations spend more days travelling; consequently, the market size of the tourism industry expands from the increase in the number of visitors. Originality/value: The originality of the paper derives from the understanding of the tourists’ behavior toward the adoption of digital marketing applications related to peer-to-peer rental services within the sharing economy in the tourism sector. More specifically, it identifies the factors that make Greek tourists to use those applications, classifies them into groups according to their attitudes towards those websites and profiles each group of tourists according to their personal and demographic characteristics and their preferences regarding their holidays/travel. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Airbnb; Digital marketing; Hospitality; Tourism marketing
"Martí-Sánchez M., Cervantes-Zacarés D., Ortigosa-Blanch A.",Entrepreneurship in the digital press: a semantic analysis,2019,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyse how the media addresses entrepreneurship and to identify the attributes linked to this phenomenon. Design/methodology/approach: The sample is defined in terms of a linguistic corpus comprised of content related to entrepreneurship drawn from the digital editions of the three most important Spanish economic newspapers for the period 2010–2017. Word association and co-occurrence analyses were carried out. Further, a non-supervised clustering process was used as the basis for a thematic analysis. Findings: Correspondence between social and media patterns related to the entrepreneurship phenomenon is revealed by the results. It is shown how attributes such as “success”, “innovation”, “ecosystem” and “woman” appear as very relevant and are linked to different co-occurrence scenarios. Relevant thematic groups are also identified related to lexical associations such as innovation, digital economy and public policies linked to entrepreneurship. Research limitations/implications: It is important to emphasise that this study has identified and explored relationships between words, but not their evolution. Furthermore, conclusions cannot be drawn concerning whether there are differences in how each newspaper has dealt with entrepreneurship because of the way the corpus was constructed. Originality/value: The study provides empirical evidence that helps to identify the way media approaches entrepreneurship.

Elaborations are made on how these concepts can be utilized for strengthening the teaching-learning process in higher education institutions, and help them gain more cutting-edge competencies in areas of learning delivery and learning engagement. Design/methodology/approach: The respondents for this descriptive study were drawn through random sampling, from an end-semester student group, who had taken up post-graduate courses in science and technology streams of a prominent science and technology university. Data was collected by administering self-reporting questionnaires. Findings: The study revealed that higher digital learning orientation is associated with improved attitude towards change and higher innovative behaviour. With conflicting results in exiting literature, regarding the influence of digital learning orientation on learning outcomes, this study adds to the body of knowledge by testing previously unexplored propositions in a student sample. Originality/value: This study is pioneering in conceptualizing and testing the proposed model. The paper emphasizes the role of digital learning orientation, especially in the context of today’s students being referred to as ‘digital natives’. It is thus imperative to understand how the same can be translated into learning outcomes.

"Walwyn D., Bertoldi A., Gable C.",Building the hydrogen economy through niche experimentation and digitalisation,2019,"Purpose: Hydrogen fuel cells could play an important role in meeting the challenges of the Two Degrees Scenario. The purpose of this paper is to review the development of this technology in South Africa with the aim of understanding how the country can transform its existing socio-technical systems and act to support a hydrogen-based technological innovation system (TIS). Design/methodology/approach: A mixed methods approach has been followed in this study. Secondary data analysis was used initially to build a profile of South Africa’s present energy system, followed by a stakeholder survey of the emerging hydrogen economy. Respondents were selected based on a convenience/snowball sampling approach and were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire, covering opportunities for South Africa in the global hydrogen economy; sources of competitive advantage; the present phase of development; the maturity of each function and the main weaknesses within the TIS; and finally the appropriate policy instrument to remedy the weakness and/or maximise opportunities for local companies. Findings: The research has shown that the hydrogen economy is still at a pre-competitive level and requires ongoing government support to ensure an energy transition is realised. In particular, it is important that niche experimentation, a proven strategy in respect of successful sustainability transitions, is further pursued. Importantly, the net cost of hydrogen-based transportation, which is still several times larger than the cost of transport based on the internal combustion engine (ICE), must be reduced, especially in the key applications of public transport and underground vehicles. Furthermore, the development of digital technologies to manage supply fluctuations in energy grids must be accelerated. Originality/value: The South Africa economy will be severely affected by the replacement of the ICEs with battery electric vehicles due to the country’s reliance on ICEs for platinum demand. Fuel cells represent a new market for platinum but the hydrogen TIS is still at a vulnerable point in its development; without policy support, it will not contribute to a successful socio-technical transformation, nor provide an alternative outlet for platinum. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Digitization; Government policy; Green manufacturing
"Seetharaman A., Patwa N., Saravanan A.S., Sharma A.",Customer expectation from Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT),2019,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to discuss how the rush of technological change will consolidate the worldwide reach of the internet with more capacity, specifically to control the physical world, including the machines, industrial facilities and frameworks that characterize cutting-edge technology. Design/methodology/approach: The data were collected from 203 respondents predominantly from emerging economies, specifically India and SEA. Most of the participants are working professionals. Structural equation modelling was used to analyze data, as it is a popular statistical technique because of its ability to model selected independent variables and take into account all possible forms of measurement error to test an entire theory. Findings: The Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT) platform comprises four fundamental capabilities: connectivity, big data, advanced analytics and application development. The IIOT has the potential to provide a high level of synergies between the 4 Ms of manufacturing, namely, man, machine, material and method. Research limitations/implications: The collected data are predominately from India and SEA (close to 75 per cent), while contributions from other regions are comparatively less, so the findings cannot be generalized to the global context. Practical implications: It is in the interest of service providers to collaborate and provide a universal solution to retain legacy systems to minimize the investment and reduce the security threat, which could boost IIOT adoption while ensuring that manufacturers are able to leverage this new technology efficiently. Originality/value: The framework obtained has good quality of validity and reliability indicators. Thus, an alternative framework has been added to customer expectation which is currently a popular topic in the technological changes. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Advanced manufacturing technology; Digitization; Information technology

Kupryushin A.P.,Innovative potential of digital economy in the process of import substitution and environmental management,2019,"Each of the stages of import substitution is faced the fact that for formation of a final economic product, it is necessary to develop a procedure for the adoption of identification, which will form the infrastructure according to certain criteria. In this regard, the issue of building infrastructure for the digital economy is becoming very relevant. The novelty of the study is the provision that the innovative potential of the digital economy in the process of import substitution and environmental management can be expanded and tested if the corresponding infrastructure is formed for this. As a basis for infrastructure, integration of the digital economy with macrocycles in the real sector, which provide a change in technological structure, is proposed. This provision is consistent with the fact that each state goes through a technological stage in due time, and all this leads to emergence of a different level of economic isolation and integration. The practical significance of the study is determined by the applicability in the field of environmental management, since the digital economy reduces the overall level of burden on the environment.

"Frey A., Trenz M., Veit D.",A service-dominant logic perspective on the roles of technology in service innovation: uncovering four archetypes in the sharing economy,2019,"The role and influence of information technology in firms’ business and value creation remains controversial. The question of how technology can drive service innovations is especially crucial in highly competitive and rapidly developing areas such as digital platforms but not well understood. This study investigates the role of information technology in service innovation in sharing economy organizations. These organizations are digital platforms that combine physical and digital service elements. Adopting a service-dominant logic perspective, we conduct an interpretive multiple-case study to gain a deeper understanding of the types of service innovation in this area and the different roles that IT can play in these initiatives. Our findings reveal different manifestations of service innovation and thereby help to identify previously unexplored interdependencies between the service ecosystem and value co-creation. We furthermore find that organizations’ choices regarding the role of IT are dependent on the level of heterogeneity and standardization of the mediated transactions. We derive four archetypes for the role of IT in service innovation that explain how and why sharing economy organizations exploit IT. We then translate our findings into practical guidelines for managers of digital platforms. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Digital platform; Role of technology; Service innovation; Service-dominant logic; Sharing economy; Value creation
"Budzinski O., Noskova V., Zhang X.",The brave new world of digital personal assistants: benefits and challenges from an economic perspective,2019,"The paper applies modern industrial economic theories to give an overview of the emerging phenomenon of digital personal assistants (DPAs). A DPA is an automated system that serves personal usage only and interacts with the user in natural language, meanwhile applying original and third-party services to obtain information and perform various actions. We analyze the economic benefits of increasing usage of DPAs, such as reduction of transaction costs, procompetitive effects, and boosting the e-commerce economy. Besides benefits, however, adopting DPA in life may also contain some risks and downsides, which may reduce the positive welfare effects or even lead to decreasing welfare: biased services, market power on the DPA market and economic dependence on a dominant DPA, potential leveraging of DPA suppliers’ market power into neighboring markets, personalized data (ab)use and privacy, media bias and manipulation of public opinion, and loss of autonomy. We identify the degree of effective competition and the degree of rationality of consumer behavior as the most relevant factors for either the advantages or the disadvantages to prevail and derive first regulatory implications. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Behavioral economics; Competition economics; Digital economy; Digital personal assistant; Economics of privacy; Platform economics

Neog N.,Usage of digital banking services by rural population: A study in sivasagar district of assam,2019,Banking sector shares a great responsibility in accumulation of capital and provides the way that is needed for investment for the growth of an economy. The bank would only be able to do so if the people are aware of savings and using the banks. Only financial inclusion cannot do so if their accounts are not active. Apart from opening up of a bank account people should try to make the account active. Digitalization of the banking services can help to a higher extent for an account to be active as it enables people to handle their account from their home. But the utilization or adoption is very limited in rural areas as the people lacks proper knowledge and sometimes find it difficult to operate an account digitally. This work was carried out to study the adoption of digital banking services and other related issues among 100 rural people from Sivasagar district. © IJSTR 2019.,Banks; Digital Banking Services; Digitalization; Economy; Financial Inclusion; Transactions
"Fürstenau D., Auschra C., Klein S., Gersch M.",A process perspective on platform design and management: evidence from a digital platform in health care,2019,"Multi-sided platforms have become the hallmark of the digital economy. However, their impact varies profoundly across different markets. We have done a longitudinal case study on HSPC, a platform jointly provided by a consortium led by multiple U.S. health care providers. Our focus is on the development processes of the platform over a period of five years and the underlying management decisions and design choices. We have developed a platform management framework to capture and reconstruct the influence and interdependencies of choices over time. The case highlights distinct strategic choices aiming at scaling of the platform and competitive positioning at an early stage of platform evolution. Our findings show four main conflicts regarding the implementation and scaling of the platform and its services as well as the processual interplay and interdependencies between different management areas. The paper thereby contributes to a process view on platform management and offers an understanding of specifics of platform evolution in health care. © 2018, Institute of Applied Informatics at University of Leipzig.",Digital health platforms; Platform governance; Process perspective; Standardization; Technical architecture
Sovacool B.K.,Toxic transitions in the lifecycle externalities of a digital society: The complex afterlives of electronic waste in Ghana,2019,"This study examines the contours of electronic waste (“e-waste”) governance in Ghana, one of the top five importers of e-waste in the world, as well as the site of one of the most intensive e-waste scrapyards in the world, Agbogbloshie. At Agbogbloshie, despite the intentions of national Ghanaian regulations and hazardous waste laws, most e-waste is untreated or crudely processed via burning or acid baths. These practices release dioxins, furans, and heavy metals into the environment, invariably harming scrapyard workers, their families, and the greater urban community of Accra. However, the scrapyard also provides a critical source of livelihood for some of Ghana's most poor, vulnerable, and unskilled migrants. The aim and objective of this study is to humanize the conundrums and challenges that e-waste invokes in places such as Ghana. Based on extensive and original field research—including expert interviews, community interviews with scrapyard workers and families, and naturalistic observation at waste sites and other parts of the e-waste supply chain—this study asks: What benefits has e-waste brought communities in Ghana? What risks has it created? And, critically, what policies need implemented to make e-waste more sustainable? It documents ten ostensible benefits of e-waste alongside ten very real and growing risks. Then, it identifies a concert of fifteen different policy recommendations as well as four research gaps. It concludes by emphasizing the duality of the e-waste phenomenon and e-waste policy, and by underscoring the political economy dynamics of e-waste activities and practices. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Digital divide; Digital society; Electronic waste; Informal economy; Informal recycling; Waste electrical and electronic equipment
"Xie P., Wu J., Du H.",The relative importance of competition to contagion: evidence from the digital currency market,2019,"How does the valuation change of an industry leader influence its competitors? Does it induce a competitive effect or a contagion effect? What are the driving forces of such influences? We attempted to answer these questions within digital currency markets. We found that both close and distant competitors against an industry leader experience high competitive effects, while moderate competitors experience high contagion effects. Next, we empirically demonstrated how this U-shaped pattern reduces to a linear relationship depending on the industry concentration. Lastly, we identified eight distinct information categories from a social media platform of the industry leader and compared the influence of the eight information categories on the industry leader’s competitors. Our analysis suggests that the relative importance of the competitive effect to the contagion effect in the industry depends on the category of the information. © 2019, The Author(s).",Competition; Contagion; Digital economy; Information spillover; Social media

"McGaughey S.L., Raimondos P.",Shifting MNE taxation from national to global profits: A radical reform long overdue,2019,"The current “Separate Accounting” taxation of corporations gives governments the right to tax the national incomes of firms operating within their borders. However, multinational and increasingly digital business models beg the question: what is national taxable income? We argue that a radical rethink of the corporate taxation – moving away from a separate taxation of national corporate income to a taxation of global corporate income allocated via “Formula Apportionment” – is long overdue. Global corporate income as a basis for taxation is supported both by recent theoretical developments and corroborating empirical evidence, with the EU and emerging economies including China already considering its adoption. Nor is it new. As we relate, formula apportionment of global corporate income was used a century ago before commercial and political interests promoted separate accounting, thereby providing both precedent and experience to inform its re-adoption. © 2019, Academy of International Business.",digital economy; formula apportionment; history in international business; income shifting; separate accounting; unitary taxation and global profits

Ilankumaran G.,Payment system indicators of digital banking ecosystem in India,2019,"From being primarily a cash-obsessed economy, India’s digital payment story is new but exciting. Driven by progressive regulatory policies and increased use of mobile internet, Indian payment industry is going through a transformational phase. Digital Payments is nothing but the transfer of money between the two Bank Accounts or Mobile Wallets in digitalized form. There is no involvement of physical cash transaction. This paper is an attempt to analyze the Payment System Indicators such as Systemically Important Financial Market Infrastructures (SIFMIs), Paper Clearing, Retail Electronic Clearing and Card Payments were taken for study for a period from 2007-08 to 2018-19. The indicators were analysed through trend analysis, correlation and regression analysis, ANOVA, mean, standard deviation, regression equation and t test. The study reveals that there is tremendous increase in the indicators like Payment System Indicators such as Systemically Important Financial Market Infrastructures (SI FMIs), Retail Electronic Clearing and Card Payments and a decline in Paper Clearing and the results are statistically si gnificant. The regression model derived is good and significant and as per Regression Model Summary, the correlation (r) is positive and high to the tune of 0.962 and the explai ned variance (R2) is 92.6 percent. The model is sloping upwards in cases of the payment indicators Systemically Important Financial Market Infrastructures, Retail Electronic Clearing and Card Payments while the trend is sloping downwards for Paper Clearing. Hence it is strongly assessed that the di gital payment has its strong role to play in the eradication of paper clearing services in banking transactions. It is suggested that the focus should be to keep the momentum going with more support from the government and innovations, safety and convenience from the players.

"Akhmadeev R., Morozova T., Voronkova O., Sitnov A.",Targets determination model for vat risks mitigation at B2B marketplaces,2019,"The objective of the study is to assess practical requirements for VAT implementation in relation to B2B e-commerce participants for the development and practical implementation of target determination model, considering the mitigation of tax risks associated with transactions on digital marketplaces, taking into account data disclosure upon corporate reporting submission. It was determined in the course of scientific and practical study of the specifics of implementation and payment of indirect taxes, that there is no general methodological approach to indirect taxation of international services accomplishment in the field of B2B e-commerce, due to the differences in the indirect taxes applied: VAT or retail tax. In this regard, the hypothesis is proposed that the provision of optimal tax conditions for electronic marketplaces to a considerable degree is fraught with the shift in business opportunities towards B2B transactions in tax jurisdictions, providing equal conditions for non-residents. In terms of international practice, the study is of significant interest as the experience of introduction of VAT implementation and payment in relation to B2B operations, VAT-exempt transactions, given that the tax and regulatory system of the jurisdiction under study is assessed as a system with increased business risks. The above calcul ations showed that B2B non-resident is in unequal conditions compared to the taxpayers of a particular jurisdiction, and the difference in the calculated VAT value is significant. However, the introduced obligation to pay VAT has not provoked the non-residents to move to the e-commerce marketplace of other tax jurisdictions. The risk zones identified during the study determined the essential need to build an optimal model on digital marketplaces, which, in our opinion, can be the basis for the development of the targets for mitigation of the tax ri sks associated with VAT payment on B2B marketplaces. In our opinion, the proposed model is universal for all business management systems and applied ERP systems, taking into account the provision of all parties in B2B transactions with access to information. Accordi ng to the results of the study, it was determined that the disclosure of information on B2B operations, indirect taxes and tax risks in corporate reporting is not imputed by the regulators and has a largely inconsistent and unstructured nature. In this regard, any proactive disclosure in corporate public reporting on B2B is possible only if the company treats the information requests from external users as significant, taking into account the calculation of the cost of preparation of the information, which does not exceed the expected effects. © 2019 by author(s) and VsI Entrepreneurship and Sustainability Center.",Digital economy; Electronic commerce; Indirect taxes; Tax base; Tax jurisdictions; Tax optimization; Tax rates; VAT
"Zeng J., Khan Z., De Silva M.",The emergence of multi-sided platform MNEs: Internalization theory and networks,2019,"The rise of the digital economy provides firms across the globe with unique business opportunities. Companies such as Facebook, Alibaba, and Uber are competing in a new multi-sided platform world; the primary focus of these firms, from their inception, is to provide digital infrastructure, information and technology—intangible assets that enable direct interaction or value creation across platforms by linking different user group and complementors, often at the international level. Building on data drawn from multinational multisided Platform corporations (MMPCs) operating in China, we combine insights from internalization theory and network effects in understanding the value creation of such firms. We explore the boundaries of these new “breed” of MNEs in exploiting firm-specific advantages (FSAs) and in creating new knowledge between headquarters and subsidiaries. The findings suggest that internalization theory needs to shift its focus from the ‘boundaries of the firm’ to the ‘boundaries of the local network’. By integrating their internal and external networks of knowledge in adapting their business models in host markets, this new breed of MNEs is more likely than the traditional one to gain a sustainable competitive advantage in the new information age. © 2019",Digitization; Emerging markets; Firm-specific advantage; Internalization theory; Location; Multi-sided platform MNEs; Networks

Lessons from wood-processing industries in new EU member states,2019,"The economic structure of many advancing economies is dominated by labour-, scale. and resource-intensive industries. Recent advances in the field of digital technologies threaten the foundations of these traditional sectors and motivate the search for policies that would help sustain jobs and secure the survival and growth of firms. The European Union places clusters high on the policy agenda as instruments for fostering industrial transformation, and increasing firm performance and competitiveness. This paper investigates the impact of clusters on firm performance in traditional wood-processing and furniture industries from two new Central European member states of the European Union during the post-crisis period of 2013–2016. The findings indicate that clusters have a positive impact on firm productivity, sales revenues, size, and export performance. Cluster members also have a higher probability of becoming high growth firms and they offer higher wages to their employees. These findings support the view that clusters are an important driver of firms’ growth and competitiveness and support the existence of cluster policies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Cluster associations; Firm performance; Industry clusters; New EU member states; Traditional industries
"Pousttchi K., Gleiss A.",Surrounded by middlemen - how multi-sided platforms change the insurance industry,2019,"Multi-sided platforms (MSP) strongly affect markets and play a crucial part within the digital and networked economy. Although empirical evidence indicates their occurrence in many industries, research has not investigated the game-changing impact of MSP on traditional markets to a sufficient extent. More specifically, we have little knowledge of how MSP affect value creation and customer interaction in entire markets, exploiting the potential of digital technologies to offer new value propositions. Our paper addresses this research gap and provides an initial systematic approach to analyze the impact of MSP on the insurance industry. For this purpose, we analyze the state of the art in research and practice in order to develop a reference model of the value network for the insurance industry. On this basis, we conduct a case-study analysis to discover and analyze roles which are occupied or even newly created by MSP. As a final step, we categorize MSP with regard to their relation to traditional insurance companies, resulting in a classification scheme with four MSP standard types: Competition, Coordination, Cooperation, Collaboration. © 2019, Institute of Applied Informatics at University of Leipzig.",Customer ownership; Digitalization; Insurance industry; Multi-sided platforms; Value network

Measures commonly used by economists to evaluate firm-level economic performance now indicate that many firms have market power and are earning profits above competitive levels. The expected response—the entry of new firms that want to earn a share of those higher returns in those markets—has not happened. This is a consequence of barriers to entry, arising from a variety of sources including increased market concentration, the increased use of intellectual property protection in the form of patents, the rise of business models dependent on network externalities, and the rising importance of digital data as an input in production. The principal conclusion of this article is that antitrust policy must be reoriented to effectively limit the creation of barriers to entry.

However, empirical research on how platform governance affects product performance through network externalities remains limited. Leveraging the perspective of platform ecosystems, this paper intends to empirically investigate the impact of platform governance on the product performance of complementors in the mobile application industry, based on firstly released apps on Apple’s App Store and Google Play. Our study shows that complementors of free mobile applications on the weakly regulated platform, Google Play, perform much better than those on the strictly regulated platform, Apple’s App Store, due to the larger size of the installed base. However, complementors on the strictly regulated platform, Apple’s App Store, can take advantage of highly valued end-users on the demand side and higher degrees of product differentiation on the supply side to enhance their product performance. This is likely due to higher entry barriers for complementors, and better user communities for end-users. We suggest that higher competition efficiency and performance levels are linked to the platforms associated with strict governance. © 2019, The Author(s).",Competition; Complementor’s product performance; Digital technology; Network externality; Platform governance; Platform heterogeneity; Product differentiation
"Berde É., Tőkés L.",The platform economy as a working opportunity for older people: The case of the Hungarian carpooling company Oszkár,2019,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to show that gig jobs could be considered an alternative way, albeit not the very best, to give work opportunities to older people. This could offset the continuously decreasing income from the pay-as-you-go pension system, which remains the main source of income for older Hungarians. Design/methodology/approach: The paper reviews the most important aspects of employment of older people and highlights the digital divide which still restricts their participation in the labor market. The paper analyzes data from the Hungarian carpooling company Oszkár and compares it with official statistical data from the Hungarian labor market, focusing on the dynamics of the employment of older persons. Findings: The findings show that the alienation of older workers from the gig economy is just transitory, and that an increasing proportion of older gig workers can be anticipated. Research limitations/implications: Compiling data on the gig economy faces a number of obstacles, as enterprises are disincentivized from revealing all their data. Social implications: Older people are more likely to be employed in lower-quality jobs, such as own-account self-employed. They are also increasingly more likely to become gig workers. Originality/value: The paper articulates the importance of remaining active as one ages and moreover challenges the traditional belief that gig jobs mainly offer opportunities to the younger generations. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Gig economy; Older labour market participants; Own-account self-employed

Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on an online survey among a panel of young American adults (N = 968). Findings: The study finds a positive effect of materialism on personal well-being and negative effects on financial satisfaction, proactive financial coping and reduced consumption, but no effect on green buying, a separate and distinct pro-environmental strategy. Both proactive financial coping and reduced consumption are positively associated with subjective well-being. Research limitations/implications: Future research should re-examine conceptualizations of materialism in the context of climate change and the meaning of possessions in the global digital economy; studies could also focus on the specific well-being effects of reduced consumption and alternative pathways to align materialistic and environmental values. Practical implications: Consumer education should look to models of financial education to demonstrate how limited natural resources can be managed at the micro level to enhance consumers’ subjective well-being, as well as reduce resource strain at the macro level. Originality/value: Key contributions are the examination of materialism and consumption in the dual contexts of financial and environmental resource constraints and the effects of these key macro-social phenomena on consumers’ perceived well-being.

Design/methodology/approach: In total, 52 papers were deemed to be relevant to the analysis. These works were critiqued using a framework that addressed geographical contexts, topics, methodologies and theoretical frameworks. Findings: This review highlights the uneven level of development of the academic debate between North America, the UK and continental Europe, and identifies the different theoretical frameworks that construe the body of literature in each region. In addition, the findings show the scant offer of work on the impact that the digital economy has on FE, as well as the reduced number of studies which have focused on certain vulnerable groups and the access to some financial services. Social implications: The studies reviewed have not analyzed the specific needs of vulnerable groups while considering the different contexts and pathways to exclusion. The evaluation of solutions and strategies to achieve inclusion is one of the least addressed aspects in the literature. Originality/value: The paper synthesizes the main contributions of the top literature on the redefinition of FI/FE in developed countries, the role of fringe services and new determinants of exclusion. The proliferation of studies regarding FI in low- and middle-income countries has generated a great amount of meta-analysis and systematized reviews of asymmetric results. However, no systematized literature review on the broad scope of FI/FE in developed countries has been published in the last decade.

Design/methodology/approach: To increase the understanding of creating sustainable customer value through digitality among traditional industrial organizations, quantitative and qualitative methods of data collection were utilized in the study. Findings: The results suggest that value creation through service process- and product-related elements constitutes improved company performance, whereas cost-related elements do not. In addition, when it comes to the role of digitality in value creation, results show that to generate benefits, digitality must be implemented in the company’s strategy and in an existing business model. Originality/value: Despite the increasing amount of literature on value creation in the digitalized world, theory and empirical understanding that reflect the complexity and dynamism of the delivery of value to customers through digitality are still lacking. This study contributes to this research gap, by presenting the characteristics of sustainable customer value that contribute to value creation. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Customer value; Digitality; Digitalization; Sustainability; Value creation
"Yang E., Bisson C., Sanborn B.E.",Coworking space as a third-fourth place: changing models of a hybrid space in corporate real estate,2019,"Purpose: This paper aims to review the concept and characteristics of coworking space, especially physical and operational characteristics and its objectives. The authors propose three models of coworking spaces, such as revenue, synergistic and customer contact, which organizations can use as a part of their corporate real estate strategies to build workplace flexibility and resiliency. This paper also addresses research gaps and a research agenda for future research. Methodology: This paper is a literature review of academic research focusing on coworking spaces. Because of the relatively limited existing academic literature on the topic, industry sources and white papers are also reviewed. Findings: The authors categorized common threads of the existing literature on coworking spaces to emergence and growth trends, the types of users, the type of work to be completed in these spaces, characteristics of coworking spaces and the desired outcomes of coworking space models. Coworking spaces are expected to grow worldwide because of the increase in knowledge-based economy, the “digital nomad” lifestyle and mobile technologies, however, there is limited research on the relationship between spatial and operational characteristics of coworking spaces and users’ collaboration, social well-being and creativity. No research identified fully articulated the nuanced differences between the types of coworking spaces now found in the real estate ecosystem. Research limitations: There is limited academic, empirical research focusing on coworking spaces. Thus, the search for literature itself is limited to a small number of papers. Although the authors extended the search to non-academic sources, the conclusion of this study is tentative because of the prematurity of the topic. Originality/value: This paper urges the identification of research questions, considering the fast growth of coworking spaces and suggests future research directions based on newly proposed models. Industry practitioners, including building owners, managers, coworking space providers and corporate real estate practitioners, can consider using variations of coworking space concepts and characteristics, as they understand the importance of social needs and connectivity among users. By addressing the history of the coworking space as a concept and business model, and updating the types of models to include new coworking spaces, the authors provide further options to industry practitioners as to how to integrate coworking into their real estate. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Coworker; Coworking; Coworking space models; Coworking spaces; Social needs; Workplace

The theoretical and methodological basis of the investigation comprises the methods of deduction and induction, theoretical generalization, abstract-logical method and the method of financial and economic analysis. The results of the research are in the statement that the digital economy of the 21st century has a powerful potential thanks to which companies and even separate countries have leading positions in the world by the key directions in socio-economical development including disruptive technologies which radically change the situation in the world market and determine the direction of further development of economic relations. It is pointed out that among such innovations the most famous is the Internet of Things, Blockchain technologies, artificial intelligence, quantum calculations, digital twins, etc. By many indicators and ratings covering the implementation of the so-called «breakdown» technologies with regard to the digitalization of economy, Ukraine is significantly behind the leading countries. Despite declarations and ambitious statements at the government level, the Blockchain technology is perhaps the only successful example of the use of disruptive technologies in our country for over the last 5 years. The possibility, the pace and risks of introducing disruptive technologies within the Ukrainian economy, which can be transformed into a conceptual initiative and a mechanism for destroying the foundations of oligarchomics, remain debatable and highly relevant. © 2019 Institute of Society Transformation.",Artificial Intelligence; Blockchain; Digital Economy; Digitalization; Disruptive Technologies; Innovations; Internet of Things; Quantum Calculations
"Li Y., Ding R., Cui L., Lei Z., Mou J.",The impact of sharing economy practices on sustainability performance in the Chinese construction industry,2019,"The sharing economy is gradually reshaping the construction industry. This study identifies the use of digital platforms, internal sharing practices with project stakeholders, and external sharing practices with unfamiliar companies as three critical elements of sharing economy practices from a socio-technical perspective. The impacts of these three elements on sustainability performance, including economic performance, environmental performance and social performance, are investigated. Based on a survey of the Chinese construction industry, proposed hypotheses are tested using structural equation modelling. The results indicate that the use of digital platforms can promote both internal and external sharing practices in the construction industry. While internal sharing practices have positive impacts on the three dimensions of sustainability performance, external sharing practices can positively influence only environmental performance. The findings enhance the understanding of sharing economy practices and provide empirical evidence of the relationships between sharing economy practices and sustainability performance in the construction sector. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Construction projects; Digital platform; Sharing economy; Structural equation modelling; Sustainability performance

The paper shows essential disruptive technologies which have determined the change of socio-economic formations of human development: from agrarian societies to industrial and post-industrial ones. The authors of the article have analyzed key disruptive technologies which form the basis for the Internet of Things. Thus, it is stated that the innovations created on the basis of personal computers, mobile phones, Internet, Wi-Fi, renewable energy, 3D printers, digital technology, artificial intelligence, RFID tags, GPS, robots, and «cloud» technologies are the original components of the Internet of Things. A prognosis is that 37 billion devices will have been connected to the Internet of Things in the world by 2024. The paper demonstrates the economic view on disruptive technologies as a phenomenon that changes the benefit-cost ratio. The article reveals possible positive and negative effects of the implementation of disruptive technologies. The concept of the so called «the innovator's dilemma» is discussed, and two principles of disruptive technologies are shown (creative, since it opens a new technological cycle, and destructive, since it undermines the production bases). The authors have empirically estimated the effects of key drivers that impact the average global GDP per capita. Thus, energy use, fixed telephone subscriptions (per 100 people), gross capital formation, improvements in life expectancy, and an increase in mobile cellular subscriptions are among the factors that increase the economic performance. © 2019 Institute of Society Transformation.

What is really ensured the projected high growth rates of digital economy made by international institutions? Will the program for the development of the digital economy in the Russian Federation be able to stimulate the competitiveness of Russia’s economy? Firstly, this article seeks to answer if high expectations placed on digital economy are equal to its real impact on the global economic growth in the long-term. It appears that despite widespread declarations the development of the digital economy is not a sustainable path for engendering rapid growth of the world economy rather an attempt to consolidate asserts globally for building a fundamentally new digital infrastructure based on microelectronic and software products on a worldwide scale and create numerous new mass markets for ICT and microelectronics TNC. Given that the authors show that at the global level, in fact two different models of the digital economy development are implemented: one for developed countries and the other for developing ones. The digital transformation model offered by international institutions to developing countries might lead to the loss of technological sovereignty and consolidation of the long-term status of “technological periphery.” Based on this analysis the authors consider Russian digital economy development program, which ignores several extremely important aspects of the implementation of international projects of digital transformation. The measures outlined in the program may not fully meet the stated goals, at least in terms of maintaining technological independence. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",

"Leoni G., Parker L.D.",Governance and control of sharing economy platforms: Hosting on Airbnb,2019,"Sharing economy platforms have recently surged as popular venues of business enabling people around the world to digitally interact and temporarily exchange their under-utilised assets. Beyond a very small number of exploratory studies of accounting practices underpinning these digital platform organisations, little is known about their governance and management control. This paper examines the governance and management control exercised by a digital platform owner over global users exhibited by Airbnb, a successful and pervasive sharing economy platform in the holiday accommodation sector. Through netnographic method, this study investigates the platform owner governance and control issues with respect to hosts. The analysis reveals the platform owner using predominantly formal bureaucratic control systems as mechanisms to govern and control its users. Through users’ compliance, they and their activities are made visible to the platform owner, which in turn maintains control over the value creation process. This study provides insights into how accounting systems are mobilised in digital platforms to facilitate their governance through mechanisms of surveillance, monitoring control over digital users worldwide, and how innovative and disruptive phenomena nonetheless rely on traditional technologies of governance to maintain power and control. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Airbnb; Control; Governance; Platform organisations; Sharing economy

However, marketers are unclear about the pattern of influence of firm-initiated (i.e., paid media, owned media, and digital inbound marketing) and market-initiated (i.e., earned social media and organic search) digital communications on B2B sales and customer acquisition. We develop and test a model of digital echoverse in an emerging market B2B context, using vector autoregressive modeling to analyze a unique 132-week dataset from a Brazilian hub firm operating in the marketplace. We find empirical evidence supporting our conceptual framework in emerging markets. Underscoring the importance of a market development approach for emerging markets, the findings show that owned media and digital inbound marketing play a bigger role in influencing customer acquisition. Impressions generated through earned social media complement owned media, but not paid media. These insights highlight the notion that while sources of digital echoverse may remain the same across countries, its components exert a particular pattern of influence in an emerging market context. This is expected to encourage managers to rethink their digital strategies for B2B customer acquisition and sales enhancement while operating in emerging markets. © 2019, Academy of Marketing Science.",Customer acquisition; Digital B2B; Digital echoverse; Digital media elasticities; Earned social media; Emerging markets; Inbound marketing; Owned media; Paid media; Sales; Vector autoregression

Based on a case study of transmission and digital information technology (H04L patents) in China, we perform a geographically and temporally weighted regression to unveil the local variations in regional technological path-dependency. To explain these variations, we further dissect the extent to which local actors may dislodge regional economy from path-dependent technological regimes, and the extent to which their path-breaking capabilities may diverge geographically. The model reveals that while all cities in China are subject to path-dependency in the development of H04L technology, the effect of technological relatedness is especially pronounced in the southern coastline, where industrial innovation enables a much larger impact of technological relatedness on H04L technological progress. By contrast, the technological path-dependency withers in the vicinity of eastern coastline, particularly in the Jing-Jin-Ji area, Yangtze River Delta and their western hinterlands, where university innovation exerts a relatively higher degree of path-breaking effect on H04L technology. Additionally, local governmental support is also conducive to inducing H04L technological discontinuities for latecomers by dislodging them from path-dependent technological regimes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",H04L patents; Path-dependency; Regional actors; Spatial variability; Technological relatedness

This article examines how the role of the citizen-consumer is transforming in the data economy, giving a simplified account of historical continuities and discontinuities. We concentrate on the commercial side of consumer citizenship, scrutinizing two periods in the history of technology: first, the 1930s–40s when the mobile citizen-consumer was invented, designed, and promoted by the US car industry; and second, the post-1990s when an even greater sense of mobility was introduced by cell phones and the Internet, drawing examples from outlying yet technologically advanced Finland.

Within the African context, and specifically in developing countries like South Africa (SA), the benefit from technology innovation can significantly impact on socio-economic issues like unemployment and skills development. Technological development is identified as a crucial driver for new growth and a means to develop and outperform global competitors. Human capital, specifically young people, supports inclusive and sustainable economic growth. South Africa as per current classification, remains a twofold economy with among the greatest inequality rates in the world, continuing both disparity and segregation. Employment remains at more than one in three youth unemployed. A group of academics and commercial partners working across disciplines collaborate to create opportunities for local young people to participate in research and data gathering at the University of Johannesburg (UJ). The need for the enablement of technology especially among the youth of the African society has initiated a research question, which determines whether technological instruments can be developed and deployed in Africa to facilitate youth.

Yet, little is known about how creative freelancers perceive the meaning of work on the platforms. Based on 40 interviews with freelancers, clients, platform owners and industry experts, this paper reveals that most freelancers are concerned about how operating through the platform, and their dependence on it, is undermining the meaningfulness of their work. Freelancers find that the platforms are eroding both the manifest (i.e. monetary) and latent (i.e. non-monetary) meaning of their work although they are mostly concerned about the latent element of meaning.

Al Dahdah M.,From Evidence-based to Market-based mHealth: Itinerary of a Mobile (for) Development Project,2019,"Information and communication technologies are increasingly used for development in the Global South, and mHealth (health assisted by mobile technologies) plays key role. This paper analyzes the particular relationship to science that characterizes a global maternal mHealth program deployed in Ghana and India. Using science and technology studies (STS), this research relies on qualitative interviews conducted between 2014 and 2016 with funders, implementers, and beneficiaries of this mHealth program. This story begins with a randomized controlled trial, a biomedical experiment with a strong positioning regarding science and the production of evidence. But rapidly the scientific stance disappears to give way to the testing and marketing of a product for the digital economy. From science to market, this paper offers to revisit a classical STS topic through the lens of mHealth. It shows how the various experimental forms taken by this project fundamentally diverge from scientific methods and evidence production and at the same time how it nurtures an ongoing instrumental relationship with science. Thus, from clinical research to product marketing, this paper highlights the tenuous link between evidence-based and market-based mHealth in the Global South. © The Author(s) 2019.",digital technologies; experimentation; Ghana; maternal health; mobile phone

This paper delves into the influence of product innovation on internationalization in SMEs and elaborates an explanatory model of their innovative behavior. Analysis of the data of 123,395 surveys of firms in 13 European countries demonstrates that product innovation drives the firm's commercial expansion and favors its exportation activity, though with a non-linear relationship and decreasing performances as innovation level increases. It is also demonstrated that, in general terms, risk in geographic market extension does not vary in a relevant way when firms are more innovative. Significant differences were detected between countries in regard to the impact of innovation and its marginal utility, and in the evolution of risk in said market extension with increasing innovation. The comparative analysis reveals differences between more and less technological industries, and, on an aggregate level, between more developed economies in the Western and Eastern European transition economies, with less marked disparities from north to south. Analysis of the model reveals the prominence of internal variables in innovative behavior, as well as a certain disconnect between firms and the institutional context in the set of countries. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Innovativeness; Internationalization; Performance; Risk; SMEs

Policymakers invest considerable resources in attracting and developing innovative, high-tech industries, but there is relatively little evidence on the distribution of the benefits. This paper investigates the labour market impact of high-tech growth on low and mid-skilled workers, using data on UK local labour markets from 2009–2015. It shows that high-tech industries – either STEM-intensive ‘high-tech’ or digital economy – have a positive jobs multiplier, with each 10 new high-tech jobs creating around 7 local non-tradeable service jobs, around 6 of which go to low-skilled workers. Employment rates for mid-skilled workers do not increase, but they benefit from higher wages. Yet while low-skilled workers gain from higher employment rates, the jobs are often poorly paid service work, so average wages fall, particularly when increased housing costs are considered. © 2019 The Authors",Cities; High-technology; Inequality; Labour markets; Multipliers; Wages

Both factors drive the expansion of material stocks which in turn determines future waste generation. For islands with limited waste treatment options an effective waste management strategy is inevitable. For the Greek island of Samothraki, construction and demolition waste (CDW) represents a new phenomenon. The advent of tourism, EU funding, labor migration and the construction of a new port in the 1960s led to an expansion of the built environment unprecedented on the island. As a consequence, new types and expanding quantities of CDW put the island community increasingly in the need for action. The European Waste Framework Directive, reinforced in 2018 with the Circular Economy Package, demands from EU member states at least 70% recycling and recovery rate of CDW until 2020. In this study, a mixed methods approach enabled the integration of data from official statistics, field surveys and interviews into a dynamic stock-driven model for different infrastructure and buildings types on Samothraki from 1971 to 2016. Our results show that the material stock expanded from 175 t/cap to 350 t/cap in the given period, leading to a 15-fold increase of annual CDW generation. With a recycling rate of only 14%, the island is currently far away from meeting the recycling and recovery targets of the EU-WFD. This study provides a systematic and dynamic analysis for developing policy and management options on reducing, re-using and recycling of CDW on islands where waste treatment options are limited. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Circular economy (CE); Economic development; Island sustainability; Lifestyles; Material flow analysis (MFA); Remote islands; Waste management

Huang Y.,Monopoly and Anti-Monopoly in China Today,2019,"For three decades after liberation in 1949, the Chinese economy consisted almost entirely of state monopolies. Economic reforms, starting in 1979, sought to increase the efficiency of the economy by introducing competitive practices in many sectors of the economy. But the Chinese economy has been partially administered by the state for over two millennia. As a result, both state-managed and private monopolies are still an intrinsic part of the Chinese economy today. Despite two decades of anti-monopoly reforms, state-owned enterprises (SOEs) continue to dominate key sectors of the economy, particularly in resource extraction and financial services. The government is aware of the inefficiencies and corruption caused by monopolies, both public and private. But Chinese tradition takes a balanced view of social harms and weighs the damage caused by monopoly against the stability that SOEs have provided China in recent decades. There is less reason for China to tolerate private monopolies, but most of them have arisen in conjunction with digital technology because of its distinctive cost structure (high entry costs, low marginal costs). China has made some use of antitrust law, but most economic regulation in China is administrative. Thus the anti-monopoly activities that are used to restrain monopoly power in China are different from Western practices. © 2019 American Journal of Economics and Sociology, Inc",

"Atuahene-Gima K., Amuzu J.",Farmcrowdy: digital business model innovation for farming in Nigeria,2019,"Learning outcomes: The Farmcrowdy case pursues the following aims: familiarizing students with the concept of business models for agricultural businesses and explaining the key decisions and activities within a business model; recognizing different opportunities for business model innovation by farmers and stakeholders in the agricultural sector; identifying concepts and tools from the business world that can be used in farming and other agribusiness-related ventures; highlighting opportunities for agribusiness firms to engage in business model innovation; and developing a business model canvas that highlights key components of a business model. Case overview/synopsis: Agriculture stands as the leading driver of economies in most African countries. Most people depend on this sector directly or indirectly for their livelihoods on a daily basis. However, due to challenges like climate change and its variability, high initial startups capital, poor pricing, pest attacks, among other factors, people are gradually opting out of this sector. This has implications for employment, food and human security issues for farmers, their families and the society at large. Individual farmers that opt to remain in this sector are often met with challenges accessing technology in adapting to the challenges aforementioned. This decreases their resilience to the impact of climate change and its variability, pest and disease attack, securing loans to expand farming operations, among others. This raises the risks associated with investment in this sector as one cannot be assured of a fixed return on investment at the end of each crop cycle. Investors who opted to manage this risk associated with investment in the agriculture sector had challenges getting an official database of farmers to invest in as well as knowing whether individual farmers are experienced enough and committed to fixed agreements. It is against this backdrop that Onyeka Akumah founded Farmcrowdy in Nigeria with the aim of empowering farmers and connecting investors to right farmers with an assured return on investment at the end of every crop growing or animal-rearing season using online technological packages. The Farmcrowdy business model allowed Nigerians to venture into farming and other agricultural ventures at the touch of a button while empowering local farmers and boosting food production, creating employment for all stakeholders in the agricultural value chain. With ensuing challenges and competitors in the agro-technological industry, Farmcrowdy aims at extending their business model to other West African countries like Ghana. A few suggestions are made to help improve Farmcrowdy business model. First, they can add novel activities to the business model. Second, they can change one or more parties that perform business model activities. Finally, they can link business model activities in new ways like the development of model farms as a training ground for new farmers and the development of a go-back-to nature campaign to end-users of the products from farms. This case can be used by different audiences. The case can be used for teaching students at the graduate level, especially in the development of executive courses on innovation and entrepreneurship, strategy, agricultural technology and innovation.

"Abubakar M., Hassan M.K., Haruna M.A.",Cryptocurrency tide and islamic finance development: Any issue?,2019,"Cryptocurrencies are hidden monies that are specifically created to be used as digital currencies while assuming the characteristics of real money. Barring the divergent opinions on whether permitted in Islamic law (that is/are halal) or forbidden in Islamic law (that is/are haram), and for which the swing tends to be in favor of its blockchain underlying technology permissibility in Islam, cryptocurrencies are undoubtedly indicating potential for relevance in the global trade, investment, and other contract settlements in some years to come. The potential of the blockchain technology is phenomenal with recent estimates suggesting it will be worth more than $20 trillion in just two years, which is more than the entire American economy. Since fortunes are made by those entrepreneurs and indeed savvy investors who have discerned its future potential earlier on, there exists some great temptation for people to jump on the blockchain bandwagon. Apparently the growing acceptability of digital fiat money as a result of technology development on one hand, and the failure of the paper money to mitigate inflation and other economic disequilibria since the disappearance of the gold standard on the other, various forms of cryptocurrencies including Bitcoins (referred to as the king) appear to roar toward wider recognition. However, an emerging phenomenon associated with cryptocurrency revolution is an observed significant fluctuation (the tide) in its value and thus a subject of discussion within Islamic finance community and beyond. In the midst of this also is the current agitation founded on some of the Islamic law (Sharīʿa) view on the necessity of asset-backed money, to be extended to the current cryptocurrency innovation for its transformation into a Sharīʿa compliant precious metal backed currency. The big question now which this chapter sought to provide the answer is, what are the implications of these developments to a more established and widening global phenomenon of Islamic finance and its development in Muslim world vis-á-vis aspirations for sustained economic development. The work finds that cryptocurrencies would generate three advantages over all forms of money including gold through: establishing a unified financial system through its standard decentralization, being rarer than gold and its significant mitigation of inflation. It is also noted that the prevalent foreign exchange risk resulting from the underlying activities (rather than the currency itself) is free from speculation (Gharar). It is, therefore, recommended that stakeholders in the Islamic Finance world should not be passive but be proactive in commencing processes to develop technical notes, standards, and operational guidelines to partake in the inevitable migration to cryptocurrencies. © 2019 by Emerald Publishing Limited.",Bitcoin; Blockchain; Cryptocurrencies; Islamic Finance; Islamic Law (Sharīʿah); Tide
McClain N.,"Caught inside the black box: Criminalization, opaque technology, and the New York subway MetroCard",2019,"This article investigates how an account of hidden, internal properties of an everyday technology became a framework to interpret human action as a serious crime. Using a case study situated in the New York subway system, I examine the criminalization of a practice of New York’s poor known as “selling swipes” performed by so-called “swipers”. A high court came to classify the practice as felony forgery, interpreting it though an expert-witness account of how objects physically manipulated by swipers interact with a secretive, proprietary digital information system. Thousands of felony arrests–overwhelmingly of nonwhite men–have been legitimated under this theory, in which the crime occurs on a plane of technical interactions to which swipers have no access. Through close examination of the underlying technology (known as MetroCard), however, I show considerable problems in the authorities’ understanding of the technology, illustrating the hazards of interpreting human action through proprietary or complex systems, especially as they are represented solely through expert accounts. The case demonstrates fresh connections between technology and unequal outcomes in the U.S. criminal justice system, and suggests an emerging form of social vulnerability, to interpretations of our actions through the logic of technologies black-boxed to us. © 2019, Published with license by Taylor & Francis. © 2019, © Noah McClain.",Criminal prosecution; criminalization; inequality; informal economy; law; magnetic stripe; MetroCard; New York subway
Kalpokas I.,Algorithmic governance: Politics and law in the post-human era,2019,"This book analyses the changes to the regulation of everyday life that have taken place as a result of datafication, the ever-growing analytical, predictive, and structuring role of algorithms, and the prominence of the platform economy. This new form of regulation - algorithmic governance - ranges from nudging individuals towards predefined outcomes to outright structuration of behaviour through digital architecture. The author reveals the strength and pervasiveness of algorithmic politics through a comparison with the main traditional form of regulation: law. These changes are subsequently demonstrated to reflect a broader shift away from anthropocentric accounts of the world. In doing so, the book adopts a posthumanist framework which focuses on deep embeddedness and interactions between humans, the natural environment, technology, and code. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

"Ray K., Sharma M.",Qualitative study of challenges and strategies of Indian IT organizations toward global branding,2019,"Purpose: There is a lacuna in research work in terms of understanding how Indian IT organizations can become global brands. Benchmarking has not received much attention in marketing literature due to lack of benchmarking framework, and IT organizations are yet to make progress in benchmarking. The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of brand strength on global branding by developing a conceptual benchmarking framework for Indian IT organizations. Design/methodology/approach: Semi-structured in-depth interviews are conducted with thirty middle-level managers from two Indian IT organizations, two US-based global IT organizations and one UK-based leading bank, which is a customer of these IT organizations. Findings: Results show a positive relationship between brand strength and global branding, between customer loyalty and global branding, between brand loyalty and competitive advantage and between global branding and competitive advantage. Indian IT organizations can benchmark global IT organizations to improve delivering brand promise, positioning, awareness building and authenticity toward making Indian IT organizations future ready to address the entire breadth of opportunities in the evolving world of cloud and digital. Practical implications: This research helps managers with a brand strength-based benchmarking framework toward global branding of Indian IT organizations. Social implications: IT is instrumental for rapid growth of Indian’s economy. India should optimally utilize its greatest wealth, its human potential, with the latent global demand in IT through building global IT brands. Originality/value: The originality of the study lies in conducting a qualitative study on global branding of Indian IT organizations and also proposing a conceptual benchmarking framework. The study further validates the model using qualitative analysis. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Benchmarking; Brand strength; Global brands; Indian IT organizations; Qualitative study
"Trabucchi D., Muzellec L., Ronteau S.",Sharing economy: seeing through the fog,2019,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to delineate the current state of the art of sharing economy (SE) research and practice. It provides a new framework to help managers and academics to consider this field with the right managerial and theoretical lenses. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature on the SE was conducted, resulting in the analysis of 114 articles in the management literature. This was completed by the empirical investigations of business model and industry of 32 members of three national associations promoting SE: SE UK, Ireland and Denmark. Findings: Papers dealing with SE themes focus on consumers’ motivations, impact on the society, market and policy, as well as the revenue model. SE businesses can be differentiated depending on whether their assets are new or re-used and the transaction is permanent or temporary. Based on this matrix, the study reveals four archetypes of SE businesses: “on-demand renters,” “lifecycle extenders,” “seller aggregators” and “ephemeral matchmakers.” Research limitations/implications: The paper outlines a significant gap between what is current focus of the academic literature and the reality of SE purposes and businesses. This provides goals for future research. Practical implications: The framework and clustering of business model archetypes may help managers and entrepreneurs dealing with SE to better understand the underlying value drivers behind those business models. Originality/value: There are some discrepancies between the SE themes emerging from the management literature and the business model diversity of SE companies. This research aims at helping scholars and managers to position themselves in the field. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Business model; Digital platforms; Marketplaces; Sharing economy; Systematic literature review; Two-sided markets
"Zheng P., Wang Z., Chen C.-H.",Smart product-service systems: A novel transdisciplinary sociotechnical paradigm,2019,"The third-wave of IT competition have embraced a promising market of low cost, high performance smart, connected products (SCP). Owing to their unique capabilities, SCPs together with their generated smart services, as a solution bundle can fulfil the everchanging individual user’s needs. Meanwhile, manufacturers/service providers leverage massive user generated data and product sensed data via the Internet-of-Things (IoT) for evergreen design innovation. This emerging IT-driven transdisciplinary engineering paradigm is named Smart Product-Service Systems (Smart PSS), which is an ecosystem consisting of various stakeholders as the key players for open innovation (social aspect), intelligent systems as the infrastructure to enable smartness and connectedness (technical aspect), and digital servitization as the value proposition to make higher profits (business aspect). Though similar terminologies have been utilized to describe such paradigm, none of them emphasizes its transdisciplinary essence, as a sociotechnical system. Moreover, scarcely any work addresses its lifecycle perspectives for sustainability concerns. Aiming to fill these gaps, this research provides a fundamental basis of Smart PSS by summarizing typical works from technical, social, and business aspects, respectively. Furthermore, its lifecycle perspectives in a circular economy is depited to motivate more in-depth research in the near future. © 2019 The authors and IOS Press.",Circular economy; Product-service systems; Smart product; Sociotechnical system; Value co-creation
"Bersch J., Diekhof J., Krieger B., Licht G., Murmann S.","Productivity slowdown, innovation and industry dynamics",2019,"Germany, in common with other industrial nations, has in recent years witnessed a decline in productivity growth despite sustained economic growth, falling unemployment and strong technological dynamics. The decline in productivity growth is not a measurement problem. However, the difficulty in measuring productivity has increased as digitalisation has spread and dynamic innovation activities have shifted into the services sector. In many sectors of the economy, the gap between highly productive and less productive firms is now widening more sharply than at the start of the millennium. More and more firms are no longer able to keep pace with the productivity growth achieved by leading firms. At the same time, there are differences between individual sectors when observing the development of intra-industry productivity divergences. The levels of innovation spending by large firms on the one hand and by small and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs) on the other have been diverging for years. As digitalisation has spread, many firms-especially SMEs-are facing considerable problems in adopting new technology. Both the public and private sectors in Germany are laggards compared with other countries when it comes to investing in these technologies. The number of business start-ups has been falling for years. This slowing entrepreneurial activity is both a symptom and a cause of the fact that financial and human resources are tied up for too long in established firms with low (productivity) growth. Economic and innovation policies are facing three major challenges: stimulating the adaptation of new technologies by investing in research and development (R&D) to foster firm innovation; promoting digitalisation; and improving the digital infrastructure. Tax incentives for R&D, indirect specific programmes to stimulate the diffusion of digital innovations, and adjustments to the regulation of markets for goods, services and factors of production would be sensible options to address these challenges. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",
Tarry A.,Design Thinking for Smaller Enterprise Development: A SOCIETALByDesign™ Model for Adaptation to a Digital Age,2019,"Design Thinking for Smaller Enterprise Development captures the zeitgeist and concerns of the new Millennium and offers a fresh view on how business can be successful by benefiting the wider society it should serve. It also highlights the systemic negative impact of a consumption and profit-focussed economy and introduces an original model - SOCIETALByDesign™ - as a constructive alternative to relentless resource depletion, through an agile, adaptive, and respectful enterprise, which protects nature and civilisation and embraces a balanced and holistic purpose to serve people, planet and a positive legacy, as the heart of its very reason of being.

"Fleming P., Rhodes C., Yu K.-H.",On why Uber has not taken over the world,2019,"Today it is common to see news headlines decrying the wildfire spread of the ‘gig economy’. We ask the exact opposite question: why aren’t more jobs now conducted via labour-based digital platforms, the primary method used in the gig economy? Surveys in the United States, United Kingdom and elsewhere indicate that gig work remains a very minor component of the labour market, and certainly isn’t overshadowing either regular employment or the contingent workforce (e.g. on-demand, part-time, contract, seasonal). The size of the gig economy is probably exaggerated because it is conflated with casual work per se (which has indeed grown) and non-labour platforms. Our paper argues that a central reason why labour-based digital platforms produce so few jobs is because it is inspired by a purist version of neoliberal capitalism, reductio ad absurdum, including strict market individualism and anti-unionism. This renders the gig economy unsustainable on its own terms, revealing its basic internal limits. The gig economy is a potent and dangerous pro-market fantasy, yet one whose imagined perfection is unsuitable to the realities of work on a large scale, hence why it has not proliferated more widely, thriving on the fringes instead. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",future of work; gig economy; labour-based digital platforms; neoliberalism; sharing economy; Uberization
"Riesener M., Dolle C., Mattern C., Kres J.",Circular economy: Challenges and potentials for the manufacturing industry by digital transformation,2019,"The world is steering towards a situation, where resource scarcity will result in cost explosion of material and governments are overstrained to dispose the constantly accumulating amount of waste in their countries. One way to overcome the resulting challenges is the implementation of a circular system, in order to create a closed material cycle and eliminate the production of further waste. The ongoing digital transformation offers the potential to enable a transition towards a circular economy. Therefore, recent studies have been examined, which advocate that digital technologies are key enabling factors to realize the shift from a linear to a circular system. Despite this general agreement, the literature still neglects how digital technologies enable such a circular economy transition for the manufacturing industry. To fill the gap, this paper presents a research framework comprising nine success factors, based on digital transformation technologies. The research framework is composed of two dimensions. The first dimension describes the three phases (manufacturing, usage and reutilization/recycling) of a product lifecycle. The second dimension depicts the design levels of business engineering (strategic-, system- and information level). Therefore, the nine success factors have been described for each level of the framework along the product lifecycle in the context of digital transformation. Thus, the paper gives recommendations to overcome the challenges of manufacturing companies concerning the realization of a circular economy. © 2019 IEEE.",circular economy; digital transformation; manufacturing industry; product lifecycle management

We invoke Simon’s (Proc Am Philos Soc 106(6):467–482, 1962) near-decomposability concept to explain how digitalization enables two distinct types of FSAs – technology and human capital. Applying the ideas of modularity and skill complexity, we further distinguish between core versus peripheral technology FSAs and between generic versus advanced human capital FSAs. Building on the transferability and appropriability of these strategic assets, we theorize on the FSAs’ internalization propensity in the digital age. We propose that with rising digitalization, the network plays a dual role – as a governance mode and as a strategic resource. Integrating insights from network economics, particularly increasing returns to scale, we propose that network advantages (On) emerge as a distinct strategic resource that merits separate investigation from the traditional asset-based (Oa) and transaction-based (Ot) advantages. © 2019, The Author(s).",core and peripheral technologies; digital SMNCs; digitalization; firm-specific assets; generic and advanced skills; governance choices; human capital FSA; internalization theory; network advantage

The advent of plastic cards such as credit and debit cards facilitate many services and products anytime and anywhere but they suffer with fraudulent attacks. This paper proposes a novel approach for the prevention of payment card frauds using biometrics. The approach works with the existing payment card security system and takes the advantage of biometric recognition technology that serves with a unique ID and bears an individual’s biometric data like Aadhaar. The integration of biometric verification system with the payment card security system not only strengthens the security of card users but also it ensures the physical presence of card holder at the point of sale. The system like Aadhaar may be successfully linked with the payment card processing system for supplementing identity verification of users and making the environment free from card frauds. The performance of the proposed payment card security system using biometrics shows that the probability of breaching user’s identity is significantly low and found to be in the range of 10-17 to 10-20 for face, fingerprint and iris recognition. © BEIESP.",Biometrics; Digital economy; Payment card fraud

"Nogueira A., Ashton W.S., Teixeira C.",Expanding perceptions of the circular economy through design: Eight capitals as innovation lenses,2019,"We widely recognize that systems approaches are necessary to tackle the complex and urgent challenges of the unsustainability of human actions on the planet. However, how we perceive systems is largely framed by who is in included in the discussion and the experiences and interests that they bring to bear. Efforts to create the circular economy aim at closing material loops, but these efforts are limited because they only consider the flows of a few types of capital - natural, manufactured and financial, and are based on specific interests of a few actors. Other types of capital - human, social, political, cultural and digital - are often ignored, and as such the full scope of dynamics in a system is missed. Even though there will always be a discrepancy between what is perceived, and the actual system in operation, there are greater opportunities to expand such perception by drawing more deeply on systems thinking and the concept of capitals. This involves expanding not only the notion of the system itself, but also acknowledging different actors and their interests, types of capital in the system, and interactions between the actors and capital stocks and flows. We develop a systems thinking framework using eight capitals, and apply it in multi-level contexts in the Chicago region to demonstrate how they provide new insights and critical pathways for the transition to the circular economy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Brownfields; Circular economy; Community capitals; Design; Systems thinking

Kim H.,Globalization and regulatory change: The interplay of laws and technologies in E-commerce in Southeast Asia,2019,"Electronic commerce has brought about business and technological changes globally, and these global changes have given rise to major legal reforms across nations. In the fast-changing global digital economy, states need strategies to maintain competitiveness of their markets while simultaneously ensuring the secure and effective use of technologies involved in conducting electronic transactions. This paper examines how the use and recognition of electronic signatures are regulated in Southeast Asia – the region that has shown the most significant growth in global e-commerce in past few years. Based on a comparative analysis of the laws of four representative ASEAN member states – namely Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, and Vietnam, this paper argues that there is a regional trend towards adopting more liberal and technology-neutral standards for electronic signatures. Electronic signature regulation in Southeast Asia is now built upon limited technological neutrality (or the so-called “two-tiered” approach) as a shared regulatory understanding, but this approach is operationalized differently in each state due to distinctive national contexts. Within the common legal framework, each state has developed its own system of control and management with respect to higher-level signatures (using advanced technologies). The principle of technological neutrality, a concept originally developed for the regulation of technologies in response to the liberalization of telecommunications market, has been the central theme of discussions on the e-transactions policy-making scene. As the author shows, in the process through which states localize the global standards of technological neutrality, ASEAN as a vehicle of regulatory change has played an essential role in translating this principle to the national context. © 2019 Heejin Kim",ASEAN law and policy; Domestic regulatory adaptation; Electronic commerce law; Technological neutrality; The use and recognition of electronic signatures
"Holcombe S., Kemp D.",Indigenous peoples and mine automation: An issues paper,2019,"The global mining sector, like other sectors of industrialised economies, is undergoing a technological transformation as part of what some commentators refer to as the ‘fourth industrial revolution’. New technologies, such as automation and robotics, are transforming the nature of mining and the nature of work. This paper discusses the implications of this shift for Indigenous peoples and the Indigenous mining workforce. In the past two decades the number of Indigenous employees in the sector has grown to unprecedented levels, most notably in Australia and Canada. The emergence of local level agreements, state regulatory requirements, and mining company policies and commitments are examined as drivers for this rise in Indigenous employment. Yet, the predicted acceleration in mine automation could disrupt this positive trend, as automation targets routine jobs which are disproportionately where Indigenous peoples are employed in manual and semi-skilled roles. There is little indication that the industry is considering the potential downside effects of mine automation on these same peoples. A careful and critical examination of mine automation and its effects on Indigenous peoples is urgently required. © 2019",Digital disruption; Employment and training; Indigenous peoples; Local agreements; Mining workforce
"Chernova V.Y., Starostin V.S., Degtereva E.A., Andronova I.V.",Study of sector-specific innovation efforts: The case from Russian economy,2019,"Accelerated introduction of digital technology has recently become one of the key areas in development of Russian economy. The paper presents the approach to innovation intensity assessment by sector and economic activity. The method makes it possible to identify the growth intensity for an output of innovative products. This serves as an indicator of introduction of new technologies and a transition to a more high-tech conversion. The narration assumes that innovations in various sectors are unstable and uneven. There is an observation that there was the highest efficiency increase over the period under review in production and distribution of electrical power, gas, and water, and in other low-tech sectors (primarily, food production). There is a highly intensive character of innovations observed in high-tech and medium-tech sectors. There is another observation that the reasons for the unstable and multidirectional dynamics are as follows: High dependence of efficiency and intensity of innovations on external economic shocks, significant impact made by measures of state support on intensity of innovations, concentration of innovating at large-scale Russian and transnational companies. The results obtained led to the conclusion on a need in more stimuli for national demand from the part of Russian businesses for innovations, including digital technology. © 2019 by author(s).",Competitiveness; Industrial economy; Innovation; Investments; Levels of technological conversion; Structural transformation of economy
"Edoun E.I., Fotso G.B.",The implication of ICT in assessing the relationship between the current account balance and the economic growth in South Africa [Влияние ИКТ на оценку взаимосвязи между балансом текущего счета и экономическим ростом в Южной Африке],2019,"For many years, continuous downgrade of the current deficit in South Africa has been a concern for a country that has an open economy and seeks for global positioning. Many authors have researched on this particular topic with an emphasis on common variables that lead to the same results. The current article seeks to highlight a predominant role played by information and communication technology in boosting the current account balance and thus enhance the economic growth in South Africa. Using a digital economic framework, this study considers time series from 2007 to 2016 (the latest full data available at the moment of research), as recent decades have been dominated by digital transformation to approach data analysis. Research findings indicated that 52.93% of GDP is explained by the dependent variables, namely foreign direct investment, ICT trade balance, computer and communications trade balance and the current account balance. This suggests that technological upgrading through digital innovation system, as well as adoption and information infrastructure, is statistically significant in affecting the current account balance and growth performance in South Africa. Data interpretation revealed that deficit on the ICT trade balance generates sustainability of the current account deficit due to a higher rate of imports compared to exports in the field of ICT in South Africa. Since ICT contributes 3.0% to the total of GDP and is a multidisciplinary field that touches all the other sectors, the South African government should restructure exiting trade policies and regulations to promote development of smart technologies. Additionally, the implementation of the sophisticated enterprise resource planning system at the level of businesses and the government should optimise productivity and profitability which are building blocks of the economic growth. However, other factors, such as policy strategies, political and currency stability are not to be neglected when moving towards long-term survival and economic growth in South Africa. © Institute of Society Transformation, 2019",Balance; Current Balance; Economic Growth; Information and Communication Technology (ICT); South Africa; Trade

Yaşlioğlu D.T.,"New economy, e-commerce businesses, and e-businesses: Types, similarities, and differences",2019,"Electronic commerce and electronic business concepts are highly researched in recent management literature. Network economy has revealed e-commerce, a new trade route that is carried out over the interlinked computers and mobile devices. E-commerce is a method used by almost all businesses that are physically processing. Therefore, there should be a significant distinction between e-business and e-commerce. With the development of e-commerce, new ways of doing business have emerged. Thus, many e-commerce companies have emerged, traditional businesses have started trading in electronic networks, and new business models have begun to be created in digital environments. In order to understand how e-businesses make money, many business models have been studied. For this reason, the concept of business model in the new economy and the transformation of business models into e-business models are examined. In line with this, it is aimed in this chapter to examine e-businesses, to clarify ebusiness models, and to explain e-commerce types and e-business model types in detail, with examples. © 2020, IGI Global.",

"Mitchell A.D., Mishra N.",Regulating cross-border data flows in a data-driven world: How WTO law can contribute,2019,"While the free cross-border movement of data is essential to many aspects of international trade, several countries have imposed restrictions on these data flows. The pre-internet rules of the World Trade Organization ('WTO') discipline some of these restrictions, but they are insufficient. Unfortunately, so are the electronic commerce chapters in modern preferential trade agreements. This article argues that reformed WTO rules, which take account of the policy challenges of the data-driven economy, are required. These reforms would facilitate internet openness while ensuring consumer and business trust, promoting digital inclusion of developing countries, and incorporating clear exceptions for legitimate domestic policies. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

"Silverio-Fernandez M.A., Renukappa S., Suresh S.",Evaluating critical success factors for implementing smart devices in the construction industry: An empirical study in the Dominican Republic,2019,"Purpose: The decentralisation of information and high rate of mobile content access in the construction industry provides an ideal scenario for improvement of processes via the implementation of the paradigm of the Internet of Things (IoT). Smart devices are considered as the objects interconnected in the IoT; therefore, they play a fundamental role in the implementation of digital solutions during the execution of construction projects. The purpose of this paper is to assess the critical factors for a successful implementation of smart devices in the construction industry. Design/methodology/approach: An empirical study was performed in the Dominican Republic. This country, located at the heart of the Caribbean, presents an economy that strongly relies on the construction industry. Following a systematic approach, a qualitative data collection and analysis was performed based on semi-structured interviews and content analysis to professionals of construction companies in the Dominican Republic, enquiring the concept of smart devices and critical success factors for implementing the devices in the industry. Findings: The key success factors obtained from the contestants were leadership, technology awareness, company size, usability of proposed solution, cost of implementation and interoperability. Originality/value: This paper provides information to clients of the construction sector regarding the benefits of embedding smart devices into their business activities. Furthermore, this study provides a better understanding of the key factors to be considered by construction organisations when embedding smart devices into their projects. This study also provides recommendations for distinct stakeholders of the construction sector, such as policy makers, clients and technology consultants. Policy makers should especially consider factors such as technology awareness and leadership to develop the right policies for the integration of the IoT in construction projects.

"Uzunca B., Borlenghi A.",Regulation strictness and supply in the platform economy: the case of Airbnb and Couchsurfing,2019,"To what extent is regulation associated with supply in the platform economy (PE)? We address this research question by analyzing the relationship between the strictness of rules/laws in 59 U.S. cities and the number of short-stay accommodation offerings. We find that the stricter regulation is, the higher the supply in these platforms. We also investigate how the presence (or lack thereof) of money transactions in the platform affects this relationship. We discover that the presence of money transactions in these platforms negatively moderates the positive relationship between regulation strictness and the supply of short-stay accommodations. This paper contributes to the literature by investigating how aggregate supply in the PE is affected by legal uncertainties, thereby joining the debate on how digital platforms are reforming labor practices in major parts of the economy and industrial value chains. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

"Ammirato S., Sofo F., Felicetti A.M., Helander N., Aramo-Immonen H.",A new typology to characterize Italian digital entrepreneurs,2019,"Purpose: Strong agreement in the extant business literature emphasizes that digital developments are key to economic growth internationally. This is in spite of the recorded high levels (up to 50 percent) of failure among digital companies and entrepreneurs. The purpose of this paper is to identify the digital debates in Italy, explore current policies and develop a typology that characterizes digital entrepreneurs (DEs) and their start-up companies in Italy. Design/methodology/approach: The digital debates and policies are explored through an extensive telephone survey of the self-perceptions and identified supports required by 348 Italian active DEs. Quantitative statistical techniques were used including factor analysis, cluster analysis and ANOVA, to identify motivations, profiles and critical success factors relevant to the sample. Findings: The study identifies three main clusters among the DEs: emerging very young; emerging business focused and experienced. These clusters vary with the entrepreneurs’ background and competence base, motivation and satisfaction factors. The different kinds of profiles require specific kinds of supporting policies identified by the sample that focus on financial, educational and/or networking provision. Originality/value: The paper affirms the central role of digital entities in modern economies expressed in the current literature and increases knowledge of the perceived success factors identified by DEs. The identification and classification of self-reported characteristics of Italian DEs and to what extent these characterizations might be useful for tailored interventions to support their success are the main contributions of this study. Accordingly, an authentic, original and self-reported portrayal has been constructed of the self-perceptions of Italian DEs. Finally, the study explores the implications for actions and new policies considering self-perceived profiles, needs and expectations of DEs. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Digital entrepreneurs; Digital start-up companies; Policies; Quantitative survey research; Self-perceptions

Chen Y.-S.,Sustainable development through franchise innovation in the digital economy,2019,"Franchising has been popular as a strategy for businesses to grow and innovate. It is even more so in today's business need of developing digital solutions for sustainability. In responding to United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, using franchise innovation to replicate proven sustainable solutions in other parts of the world is an effective approach to scaling up solutions to achieve Sustainable Development Goals. The essence of a successful franchise innovation lies in managing the good relationship between the franchisor and the franchisee. In this paper, we show that digital business solutions for sustainability play an important role in growing and nurturing such a good relationship. Specifically, we discuss that franchise innovation via Netchising, combining the digital power of the Internet for global demandand- supply processes and the international franchising arrangement with local business solutions for sustainability, is an entrepreneurial approach to communities' development where economic and social aspects are mutually supportive. © 2020, IGI Global.

"Rodima-Taylor D., Grimes W.W.","International remittance rails as infrastructures: embeddedness, innovation and financial access in developing economies",2019,"Remittances to developing economies constitute one of their most important and consistent forms of capital inflow, but have long been limited by costs and risks associated with trans-border payments. New digital platforms lower these, with significant implications for financial inclusion and economic development. Constituting an important element of developing countries’ engagement with international finance, remittances engender new opportunities for empowerment and vulnerability. This article analyzes recent developments in international remittances to developing countries through the lens of infrastructure. The infrastructural perspective reveals important junction points between diverse money transfer pathways and institutions, depicting their spatial configuration and relationality as well as their potential to affect power differentials, and allowing for a socially embedded view of digital disruption. Drawing on examples in Africa and Asia, we show that the new generation of remittance infrastructures are best understood as assemblages of multiple elements, conjoining monopolistic trunks that depend on local innovations to traverse the ‘last mile’ to reach end-users. The vibrancy and indispensability of local networks and innovation, along with competition among core platforms, allow for significant agency and economic opportunity even among communities beset by poverty. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",assemblage; digital payments; Infrastructure; innovation; mobile money; remittances
Szalavetz A.,"Digitalisation, automation and upgrading in global value chains - factory economy actors versus lead companies",2019,"This article investigates the differences in the application and impact of digital technologies between manufacturing subsidiaries and lead companies, the principal orchestrators of global automotive value chains. Utilising a dataset of 10 in-depth interviews with automotive industry actors, we analyse headquarters–subsidiary differences in the patterns of digitalisation-driven upgrading. A theoretical framework is offered that explains why the significant upgrading achievements of manufacturing subsidiaries deploying industry 4.0 technologies will not reduce the gap between lead companies and manufacturing subsidiaries in terms of value generation. We show that the concept of ‘industry 4.0’ is much narrower than that of ‘digitalisation’ and transition to smart factories is only part of the digital transformation story. Industry 4.0 technologies contribute to the upgrading of operations, and enable subsidiaries to take on production-related knowledge-intensive assignments (functional upgrading). Conversely, digitalisation serves lead companies’ strategic differentiation efforts, and facilitates achieving competitive advantage: the latter are crucial for value capture. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",automotive industry; Digital transformation; disruptive innovation; global value chains; industry 4.0; upgrading

In this paper, we explore the role of cities in facilitating digital entrepreneurship and overcoming institutional resistance to innovation. Drawing upon two historical case studies of digital entrepreneurship in the city of Stockholm along with an extensive material on the sharing economy in Sweden, our results suggest that cities offer an environment that is critical for digital entrepreneurship. The economic and technological diversity of a city may provide the field conditions required for institutional change to take place and to avoid regulatory capture. © 2018 The Authors",Agglomeration; Cities; Digital entrepreneurship; Digital innovation; Field conditions; Institutional entrepreneurship; Regulatory capture
Holroyd C.,Digital content promotion in Japan and South Korea: Government strategies for an emerging economic sector,2019,"Already leading the world in the development of consumer electronics, South Korea and Japan have been leading innovators in the creation of digital content economies. Both governments recognized both the commercial potential and the employment possibilities associated with the digital content industry. The sector, however, did not fit easily with existing industrial and technological models of economic development, particularly due to the small size of digital firms, the youth culture orientation of most products and services, and the antiestablishment ethos of the creative industries generally. In Japan, digital content firms created a robust domestic market but struggled to get international market share. Government policy, therefore, has focused on building international interest in digital products. Although South Korea has enjoyed considerable success through their K-pop cultural exports, it has really capitalized on the country's highly successful online gaming industry. South Korean policy initiatives emphasize public promotion of Korean digital content with sizeable investments in creator and incubator spaces for start-up firms. Together with initiatives in Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, the Japanese and South Korean efforts demonstrate how Asian countries have sought to integrate the digital content sector into their national innovation strategies and to jump-start a promising and potentially valuable economic sector. © 2019 The Authors.

Given that these economies generally lack a well-developed institutional framework, we draw on the concept of institutional voids as our theoretical lens. We argue that digital entrepreneurship facilitates the navigation and bridging of socio-cultural institutional voids but also provides opportunities for entrepreneurs to directly and indirectly alter the existing institutional context. We illustrate these arguments by drawing upon six biographical narrations of female digital entrepreneurs in Saudi Arabia. Accordingly, through our development of a multi-level model, we make explicit the two-way causal interaction between entrepreneurial action, institution altering behaviour and the social and cultural context, thus providing a framework for future research. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Biographical narrations; Digital entrepreneurship; Female entrepreneurs; Institutional voids; Saudi Arabia

However, the sharing economy’s implications for marketing thought and practice remain unclear. This article defines the sharing economy as a technologically enabled socioeconomic system with five key characteristics (i.e., temporary access, transfer of economic value, platform mediation, expanded consumer role, and crowdsourced supply). It also examines the sharing economy’s impact on marketing’s traditional beliefs and practices in terms of how it challenges three key foundations of marketing: institutions (e.g., consumers, firms and channels, regulators), processes (e.g., innovation, branding, customer experience, value appropriation), and value creation (e.g., value for consumers, value for firms, value for society) and offers future research directions designed to push the boundaries of marketing thought. The article concludes with a set of forward-looking guideposts that highlight the implications of the sharing economy’s paradoxes, maturation, and technological development for marketing research.

Just S.N.,An assemblage of avatars: Digital organization as affective intensification in the GamerGate controversy,2019,"Through a study of the so-called GamerGate controversy, this article argues that a new dynamic of affective intensification is currently instating itself in the digital organization of not only highly collaborative industries, such as that of gaming, but of society as such. This dynamic may best be understood and conceptualized through reconsiderations of the notions of affective economies and affective labour. The affective constitution of digital organization is a process of affective intensification that not only works like an economy but is directly productive of economic value, and not only involves human emotionality but technological affectivity as well. Guided by the notions of assemblage, affordance and agency, the article offers a conceptual framework for studying affective intensification in and as socio-technical processes of value production. © The Author(s) 2019.",#GamerGate; affective intensification; Digital organization; financialization; virtuality

"Delacroix E., Parguel B., Benoit-Moreau F.",Digital subsistence entrepreneurs on Facebook,2019,"Digital entrepreneurs are usually presented as young, urban, well-educated individuals working for innovative start-ups. In sharp contrast with this “hipster” view, this research identifies digital subsistence entrepreneurs as a new type of entrepreneurs that recently appeared in developed countries. To do so, it investigates buy-and-sell activities on Facebook groups using a multi-method approach involving in-depth interviews, netnography, and participatory observation. The findings indicate that digital subsistence entrepreneurs' activities pertain to survival entrepreneurship rather than transformative entrepreneurship. Nonetheless, they satisfy more than purely financial needs, also providing hedonic (spending time with family, creating), relational (meeting new people) and symbolic benefits (raising self-esteem, redefining roles at home and in society). This research also shows that subsistence entrepreneurs' rebirth in developed countries is founded on the structural, cognitive and relational forms of social capital that are grounded in peer-to-peer platforms digital features. It thus offers interesting contributions and implications for public policy makers engaged in the regulation of the sharing economy. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Digital entrepreneurs; Facebook groups; Peer-to-peer platforms; Social capital; Subsistence entrepreneurship

Digital transformation, labor and work organization: a view from Spain",2019,"The paper offers an overview of how the process of technological innovation known as digitization affects the capitalist production mode and its relations of production, particularly in Spain, based on a review of the bibliography and the statistical sources available. The gradual appearance or development, since the last quarter of the last century, of a set of information and communication technologies, which allow the hybridization between the physical and the digital world, erasing the borders between both worlds, has led to talk of Industry 4.0 also called “the fourth industrial revolution”. After this supposed revolution, there would be a digital revolution. Though is paradoxical that, since the 1980s, in Europe the industry continues to lose weight in the economy as a whole, in employment and participation in Gross Value Added. The paper reviews the effects of digitalization and automation on employment and working conditions, in particular polarization, changes in employment shares across occupations, and jobs at risk, with some emphasis in the Spanish case.

"Wu Q., Zhang H., Li Z., Liu K.",Labor control in the gig economy: Evidence from Uber in China,2019,"The rapid development of digital platform businesses has facilitated the expansion of gig work in China and elsewhere in recent years. Now that IT-powered platforms have been used in part to free the capital from taking employer responsibilities, the capital’s toolkit for labor control has been significantly limited. Drawing on qualitative field research supplemented by quantitative data on Uber in China, this article provides a novel empirical account of the labor control of digital platforms, and more importantly, their effects on different types of workers. The authors have identified three crucial strategies that Uber has devised to control its drivers’ labor process: an incentive pay system, a customer evaluation system, and flexible work arrangements. These strategies will, however, demonstrate significant effects on drivers’ working hours and income only when we consider the different motivations of Uber drivers. Specifically, the working efforts of those who drive for Uber as their only source of income are responsive to incentive pay schemes and a platform’s evaluation system, but are not as responsive to work flexibility. The exact opposite is the case for drivers who have other jobs and sources of income. © 2019, Australian Labour and Employment Relations Association (ALERA), SAGE Publications Ltd, Los Angeles, London, New Delhi, Singapore and Washington DC.",China; digital platform; gig work; labor control; labor process

We show that the production of AI is a labor-intensive process, which particularly needs the little-qualified, inconspicuous and low-paid contribution of “micro-workers” who annotate, tag, label, correct and sort the data that help to train and test smart solutions. We illustrate these ideas in the high-profile case of the automotive industry, one of the largest clients of digital data-related micro-working services, notably for the development of autonomous and connected cars. This case demonstrates how micro-work has a place in long supply chains, where tech companies compete with more traditional industry players. Our analysis indicates that the need for micro-work is not a transitory, but a structural one, bound to accompany the further development of the sector; and that its provision involves workers in different geographical and linguistic areas, requiring the joint study of multiple platforms operating at both global and local levels. © 2019, Associazione Amici di Economia e Politica Industriale.",Artificial intelligence; Automotive industry; Digital platform economy; Micro-work; Organization of work

It discusses the drivers of changes in global natural gas consumption and trade flows from 2008 to 2015 using the extended logarithmic mean Divisia index. The results show that differences in the natural gas supply and demand across countries or regions, as well as the distribution of energy between the domestic and international markets, can be better explained when natural gas trade movements are considered. By comparing the supply and consumption increment of natural gas, this study finds that only the energy intensity, economic growth, and demographic effects are consistent with each other. The changes in the impact of other effects mainly depend on storage variations and statistical errors. In addition, the primary drivers of the incremental changes in natural gas consumption vary in different countries. They include production scale, import scale, export scale, consumption structure proportion, energy intensity, economic growth, and population and balance effects. Finally, the consumption competitiveness of the liquefied natural gas significantly improved over the examined period. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Liquefied natural gas; Logarithmic mean Divisia index; Natural gas consumption; Natural gas trade flows; Pipeline natural gas
Kumaresan D.,An insight of working women into cashless transactions in select districts of Tamil Nadu,2019,"Cashless economy is a paradigm shift in the Indian Economy, particularly in the post-demonetization period. The barter system was replaced by the introduction of money – coins and currency notes. It helped the people to exchange goods and services by the common medium of exchange. Cost of producing coins paved the way for the circulation of more currency notes. Higher denomination currencies were brought into use to facilitate the business people to carry out their business activities easily. However, on the flip side, there emerged the issues of fake currencies, black money, etc. The measures taken from time to time to address these issues were found to be inadequate and inappropriate. Having realized the seriousness of the issues, the digitalization has been encouraged. Even though there have been challenges like lack of awareness, lack of adequate infrastructure and cyber crimes, it is pleasure to note that the cashless transactions are accelerated. Working women have been one of the influential sections of the society towards the economic growth of the country. Digital transactions could enable them to have faster and safer economic transactions. It is imperative to understand the perception of working women about the cashless transactions.

"Kabanov A.S., Azarov V.N., Mayboroda V.P.",An Analysis of the Use and Difficulties in Introducing Information Technology and Information Systems in Transport and the Transport Infrastructure,2019,"The article deals with the problems associated with the widespread introduction of digital and information technologies in various sectors of the economy of the Russian Federation, including in the transport and logistics sector. Digitalization and informatization of the transport complex, logistics processes that were perceived not so long ago as something far from reality, today are the basis of modern transport business processes prove their necessity and efficiency. The paper analyzes various informational technical transport systems (ITS) of transport and transport infrastructure management, and shows that the implementation process is not quite systematic on Russian roads. It is shown that the lack of common standards and technological platforms leads to the emergence of a number of problems, such as electromagnetic and information incompatibility, unacceptable threats and risks, cyber security, organizational disunity, inconsistency and chaos of ITS management. It is shown that to create and ITS transport industry, it is necessary to promote a unified set of standards, a single technological platform, use the principles of system engineering and build an IT architecture and infrastructure. Not timely adoption of integration measures may further lead to a traffic collapse, or Russia's lag in the development of intelligent transport and transport infrastructure. © 2019 IEEE.",Business processest; Electromagnetic compatibility; Enterprise architecture; Information technology and information systems; Intelligent transport systems; Standards
"Swain N., Mokashi A.A., Jain A.","Status of financial inclusion in India, persisting challenges and way forward",2019,"Financial inclusion is a critical pillar of development and has been a major policy thrust for the Indian Government over the decades. However some of the major policy impetuses were received the last one decade resulting in some of the biggest policy interventions for financial inclusion in the world. Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, Direct Benefit Transfer under Digital Banking and Aadhar has been significant interventions in this area. Despite these and several areas policy measures as well as technological innovations adopted by RBI and banking sector, even though encouraging, is much less than satisfactory when it comes to their extent and penetration when it comes to usage by marginalized sections, people in the informal economy and those living in remote areas. The significant barriers for achieving inclusive growth are Financial illiteracy, lack of convenience, technology issues and viability. This study aims at integrating some of the results of existing literature on financial inclusion and role played by Government, RBI and the other banks in promoting inclusive growth. It also attempts to analyze the key persisting challenges on the demand as well as supply aspects of financial inclusion. On the basis of its findings the paper proposes a set of preliminary recommendations to strengthen and support financial inclusion in India. It has been observed that the financial sector has still not been able to design appropriate products in a sustainable way that can address the needs of the poor, those who are in the informal economy or to identify key gaps in a huge and diverse country like India where social security is very low for most of population. Technology obviously is playing and still needs to play a far greater role in addressing some of these challenges which the traditional banking models have failed to address. © BEIESP.",Banks; Direct benefit transfer; Financial inclusion; Inclusive growth; Jan Dhan Yojana; Policy; RBI; Technology
"Nepomnyashchikh I.F., Lazareva O.S., Artemyev A.A.",Land resource management: Geoinformation support of internal controlling,2019,"The trend towards globalization of the world economy is currently increasing. Therefore, corporate entities seek to expand their economic power and influence. It spurs them to constantly look for ways to improve the efficiency of their activities, both in the domestic and foreign markets. These circumstances force corporate structures to accelerate the pace of their development. In this regard, they introduce innovations, reduce costs, use available resources more efficiently, as well as optimize the selection of missing ones, including land resources. Comprehensive and up-to-date information on the existing assets and liabilities contained in the geographic information system(s) and assessment of the efficiency of their use can help companies expand their economic possibilities. The creation of relevant databases and their interpretation become possible with the use of modern geoinformation technologies for creating and processing localized geospatial information about land plots and everything closely related to them. The purpose of the study is to identify the possibility of using and assessing the total data on land resources and everything related to them. These data are stored in the relevant geoinformation system(s) to increase the efficiency of controlling in the framework of the corporate management system. The main scientific results and conclusions obtained by the authors in the course of this study are as follows: 1. The possibility of improving the efficiency of controlling through the use of geoinformation support and geoinformation systems as a source of receiving, processing, interpreting, and visualizing geospatial data on corporate and other land and property resources has been proved. 2. The methodology for assessing the efficiency of land use based on the author’s cube model and the suggested rating criteria has been proposed. © 2019. ASERS Publishing.

"Tomljanović M., Grubišić Z., Kamenković S.",Deindustrialization and Implementation of Industry 4.0-Case of the Republic of Croatia,2019,"The industrial sector of the Republic of Croatia is subject to deindustrialization, which was globally recognized as early as in the 1960s. Such a situation is a challenge in terms of implementing new sources of economic growth and industrial production, with a particular emphasis on investing in research and development, education and their products. Since 2011, special emphasis has been placed on the need to implement the concept of Industry 4.0. The problem surveyed in this research derives from insufficient readiness of the Republic of Croatia to implement Industry 4.0, mainly resulting from its major orientation towards traditional industrial sectors and a low share of high value added activities, which is particularly visible through the share of high technology products in total exports. However, the Republic of Croatia is characterized by low levels of scientific research and innovative activities, which greatly slows down this process. The aim of the conducted research is to present the theoretical aspects of the process of deindustrialization and Industry 4.0, to make projections of the key indicators of deindustrialization and Industry 4.0 until 2025, and to propose scientifically based measures to be taken in the direction of securing digital transformation of the Croatian industry. The purpose of the conducted research is to analyse trends in the industrial sector in the Republic of Croatia and to determine the current state of the (de)industrialization process and the level of implementation of Industry 4.0. The research has showed that the process of deindustrialization in the Republic of Croatia is characterized by a reduction in the share of employment in the primary sector, by a growing employment in the secondary sector, and by a relative increase in industrial production and labour productivity. However, since 2015 there has been an increase in employment in the secondary sector, which is in contrast to the theoretical concepts of deindustrialization and indicates a new trend in the industrial sector. This situation is a challenge concerning the implementation of Industry 4.0, which requires increased investment in research and development and the improvement of knowledge and the ability of the population and their implementation in the economic sector. By analysing this segment of the Croatian economy, some progress has been made. Also, it has also been found that in some segments it significantly lags behind the EU levels. © 2019 Marko Tomljanović et al., published by Sciendo.",deindustrialization; education; Industry 4.0; Republic of Croatia; research
"Yousfani K., Khowaja F.",The role of digital economies in the development and growth in Asian business models,2019,"This chapter discusses the development of information and communication technology across Asian economies. Digital technology is the presentation of information in bits that emphasize digital technology which covers all business, financial, social, and cultural events that are supported by the web and other digital communication technologies. Technology has minimized the cost of storage, and flow of information. In the last 15 years, digital technology has affected human lives and the chapter examines how digital technology changes economic activity. There are three principal segments: e-business, ebusiness framework, and e-commerce. The digital economy is known as the web economy because of its dependence on the network. Modern technologies, cloud computing, mobile app, and social media influence the business landscape, reshaping the idea of work, boundaries of enterprises, and the obligations of business pioneers. Thus, the digital economy features the opportunity for organizations and people to execute existing tasks on the PC more frequently than before. © 2020, IGI Global. All rights reserved.",
Oflaz N.K.,Blockchain ecosystems in the sharing economy: An evaluation for the health services industry,2019,"In the 21st century, the free movement of information became quite important with the increase of internet technology. The fact that people can exchange money or data with each other without the need for any intermediary has led to the development of a new economic area under the name of the sharing economy. One of the most important features of the sharing economy is that the parties of the economic transaction establish this relationship through a technological platform. Similarly, allowing peer-topeer transactions and seeing them as a reliable and public platform has made blockchain technology the focus of attention as a digital business technology in various sectors. In this study, blockchain technology, which is considered as the future technology of the sharing economy, is explained within the framework of a health sector model that deals with the partnership between the sharing economy and blockchain technology. © 2020, IGI Global.

"Rusthollkarhu S., Aarikka-Stenroos L.",The effects of AI-human-interaction to value creation in multi-actor systems: How AI shapes digital B2B sales,2019,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has been recognized to be the most disruptive technology in the next ten years. The disruptive potential of AI is based on enhanced data processing capabilities which enable broader task automation but also allows AI to change its behavior based on user input. Simultaneously with AI development new platform-based business structures have gained traction and disrupted traditional pipeline business models. Platform business models rely on digital infrastructures to connect the supply and demand. AI has great potential to enable efficient resource allocation in these kinds of systems and in that way enhance the potential of value creation. Despite this complementary condition between AI and platform-based business, no academic understanding concerning the intertwinement of AI technologies and platform structures has yet been published. This position paper introduces five research areas which help us to understand AI enhanced value creation in B2B sales platforms through technology interaction.

Tleppayev A.,Digitalisation and energy: World experience and evidence of correlation from Kazakhstan,2019,"The rapid pace of development of the digital economy is an effect conditioned by technology and innovation that have been developing over several decades and becoming more common. The number of Internet users in Kazakhstan increased from less than 1% in the 1990s to 81% in 2018, which happened due to a sharp decline in the cost of access and a high increase in computing power. The technological revolution has become a source of stimulating economic growth with less energy consumption. Digitalisation is considered to be a factor contributing to energy efficiency in the economy. The relationship between digitalisation, energy consumption and economic growth is a theme which has gained momentum recently. This paper attempts to estimate the effects of technology and economic factors on the energy intensity in Kazakhstan. The paper employs econometric methods: the unit root test, cointegration methods and the Granger causality test. All data were obtained from the World Bank's database for the period between 1994 and 2018 as well as the Statistics Committee of the Ministry of National Economy of the Republic of Kazakhstanand the Odyssee database by EU. The results demonstrate that Internet usage and trade openness impact energy intensity. The results demonstrate that Internet usage and trade openness has a negative effect on energy consumption in the long run. The liberalisation trade and economy reduces the consumption of energy obtained from fossil fuels and minimises environmental degradation. Digitalisation is supposed to stimulate the efficiency of the energy system by optimising consumption and metering, reducing losses, generating with lowest possible costs and emissions, etc. Economic growth has a positive and statistically significant impact on energy intensity. The article contains certain recommendations for policy makers: the government should attract more investment and provide consistent support for ICT to increase the energy efficiency and to decrease total energy consumption. © Institute of Society Transformation, 2019.",Digitalisation; Economic Growth; Energy Consumption; Energy Intensity Index; GDP; ICT; Internet Usage; Technological Revolution
"Ernst E., Merola R., Samaan D.",Economics of Artificial Intelligence: Implications for the Future of Work,2019,"The current wave of technological change based on advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) has created widespread fear of job loss and further rises in inequality. This paper discusses the rationale for these fears, highlighting the specific nature of AI and comparing previous waves of automation and robotization with the current advancements made possible by a widespread adoption of AI. It argues that large opportunities in terms of increases in productivity can ensue, including for developing countries, given the vastly reduced costs of capital that some applications have demonstrated and the potential for productivity increases, especially among the low skilled. At the same time, risks in the form of further increases in inequality need to be addressed if the benefits from AI-based technological progress are to be broadly shared. For this, skills policies are necessary but not sufficient. In addition, new forms of regulating the digital economy are called for that prevent further rises in market concentration, ensure proper data protection and privacy, and help share the benefits of productivity growth through the combination of profit sharing, (digital) capital taxation, and a reduction in working time. The paper calls for a moderately optimistic outlook on the opportunities and risks from AI, provided that policymakers and social partners take the particular characteristics of these new technologies into account. © 2019 Ekkehardt Ernst, Rossana Merola and Daniel Samaan, published by Sciendo.",artificial intelligence; inequality; productivity growth; technological unemployment

"Kunz W.H., Heinonen K., Lemmink J.G.A.M.",Future service technologies: is service research on track with business reality?,2019,"Purpose: Service technologies are transforming the business landscape rapidly. This paper aims to explore the current scope of research in regard to emerging service technologies by comparing the content of articles in academic journals with practitioner-oriented publication outlets. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 5,118 technology-related articles from service journals, service conferences, business journals and business magazines are analyzed. Text-mining on abstracts is used for the thematic and semantic analysis. Common research themes and their relationships are depicted in a two-dimensional structured network. Further, the sample is analyzed regarding various technologies mentioned in the Gartner Hype Cycle. Findings: The paper reveals differences in academic and business perspectives in regard to service technologies. In comparison to business journals, scientific service research is more focused on customer-related aspects of technology. Service research has a less concrete focus on technology than in business publications. Still, service conference articles show a broader scope of emerging service technologies than academic journal articles. Research limitations/implications: Scientific research should focus on more concrete service technologies. Business magazines serve as a good source for that and the paper identifies several promising new technology fields. Practical implications: Although business magazines cover significantly more concrete service technologies, they miss the integrated perspective that academic articles usually offer. Academia can help business to better align concrete technologies with different internal and external perspectives. Originality/value: This paper serves as an introduction to the special issue Future Service Technologies. Additionally, a quantitative study of recent service technology research serves as a reality check for academic researchers on business reality and provides research and practical recommendations. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Digital; Digital economy; Future; Leximancer; Self-service technology; Technology adoption; Text-mining
Aaronson S.A.,"Data is different, and that’s why the world needs a new approach to governing cross-border data flows",2019,"Purpose: Companies, governments and individuals are using data to create new services such as apps, artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT). These data-driven services rely on large pools of data and a relatively unhindered flow of data across borders (few market access or governance barriers). The current approach to governing cross-border data flows through trade agreements and has not led to binding, universal or interoperable rules governing the use of data. The purpose of this article is to explain the new role of data in trade and to explain why data in trade is different from trade in other goods and services. We then suggest a new approach at the national and international levels. Design/methodology/approach: The author uses a mixed methods approach to examine what the literature says about data as a traded good and or service, examines metaphors regarding the role of data in the economy, and then examines whether or not data is really “traded.” Findings: Many countries do not know how to regulate data driven services. There is no consensus on what the appropriate regulatory environment looks like, nor is there a consensus on what are the barriers to cross-border data flows and what constitutes legitimate domestic regulation.

"Jara A.J., Bocchi Y.",GEO-Trust: Geo-aware security protocol for enabling cross-border trustable operations and data exchange in a global digital economy,2019,"Security and trustability in Internet is a baseline problem that continues arising as far as digitalization and data economy are taking place. It is well-known the value of data in the current digital age and social media economy. Consequences of this has produced a digitally-enabled data capture for different business domains and research. Nowadays, there is a lack of trustability for sharing data. In addition, legal regulations about data protection such as Swiss Data Protection Act (DPA), which is being updated and influenced by GDPR's European Union principles are defining a more restrictive regulation about data usage, data geo-location and data sharing which are crucial to enable a data economy. Therefore, key challenges need to be addressed for guarantying a safe and regulations compliance flow of data (cross-borders). GEO-TRUST is developing techniques and algorithms that promote regulation of data exchange, trustability, consent management, reputation and security as contribution for the emerging Data Economy Ecosystem. In details, GEO-TRUST project proposes an innovative protocol called Proof of Offset (POO) to enable a higher control and limit data access by geo-location, accountability, data exposition minimization, data semantic annotation that guarantee cross-domain data re-use and higher awareness about data protection.

"Lammers T., Tomidei L., Trianni A.",Towards a novel framework of barriers and drivers for digital transformation in industrial supply chains,2019,"Businesses across all sectors are facing the complexity of an increasingly digital economy. Digital transformation offers vast opportunities to businesses and entire supply chains. While many investments are targeted at the organization level, the supply chain perspective can lead to even greater impacts on business performance. However, as supply chains involve interconnections between multiple actors, comprehensive digitalization initiatives at this level are very complex. Several strategic factors affect decision-making around digital investments. For this reason, a framework that categorizes all these factors is needed in order to help managers build digitalization strategies for their supply chains. In this paper, based on a review of existing literature, we give indications for a framework encompassing barriers to and drivers for digital transformation in the context of industrial supply chains. Our framework preliminarily allocates these factors by using two dimensions. The first one classifies them using several categories: financial, knowledge and skills, regulatory, technological, market, organizational, and cultural. The second dimension classifies determinants at the level on which actions can be made, i.e. market, supply chain, or organization. The framework can support organizations to exploit the opportunities provided by digitalization of supply chains and will help managers understand the complexity involved. © 2019 PICMET.",
"Tou Y., Watanabe C., Moriya K., Neittaanmäki P.",Harnessing soft innovation resources leads to neo open innovation,2019,"Advancement of the digital economy has transformed the concept of the growth crossover in nations and firms, both concerning input and output. Advanced economies have been confronting a dilemma between input increases and output decreases. Contrary to traditional expectations, excessive increase in input has resulted in a productivity decline in output. A solution to this dilemma can only be expected by harnessing the vigor of soft innovation resources that lead to neo open innovation in the digital economy. This paper attempts to demonstrate this hypothetical view. Based on an empirical analysis of the development trajectories of 140 countries and 500 global ICT firms, dynamism, resulting in bipolarization between a virtuous cycle and a vicious cycle between input increases and productivity enhancement, was discovered. Furthermore, an empirical analysis focusing on the development trajectories of two world ICT leaders, Finland and Singapore, identified a mechanism of neo open innovation that assimilates soft innovation resources into a national production system. This mechanism can substitute for research and development (R&D) and removes structural impediments to growth while providing relief from the increasing burden of R&D investment. The above findings provide insightful suggestions for drafting a roadmap towards neo open innovation in the digital economy. © 2019",Digital economy; Dilemma; Neo open innovation; Productivity decline; Soft innovation resources

Lee J.-A.,Tripartite perspective on the copyright-sharing economy in China,2019,"Internet and digital technologies have facilitated copyright sharing in an unprecedented way, creating significant tensions between the free flow of information and the exclusive nature of intellectual property. Copyright owners, users, and online platforms are the three major players in the copyright system. These stakeholders and their relations form the main structure of the copyright-sharing economy. Using China as an example, this paper provides a tripartite perspective on the copyright ecology based on three categories of sharing, namely unauthorized sharing, altruistic sharing, and freemium sharing. The line between copyright owners, users, and platforms has been blurred by rapidly changing technologies and market forces. By examining the strategies and practices of these parties, this paper illustrates the opportunities and challenges for China's copyright industry and digital economy. The paper concludes that under the shadow of the law, a sustainable copyright-sharing model must carefully align the interests of businesses and individual users. © 2019 Jyh-An Lee",Copyright; Creative commons; Fair use; Free software; Freemium; Notice and takedown; Open data; Open-source software; Sharing economy; User-generated content

Tomita A.,A managing framework for artificial intelligence to supplement human workforce in a digital economy,2019,"Recently artificial intelligence (AI) spring has been brought about by the needs from the aging world as well as advances of the deep learning technologies. Japan is the world's most aged country: 33 percent of its population were aged 60 years or over in 2017. The population aging and population decline contribute to a decline in growth potential. Recalling the growth accounting equation, productivity, neither capital nor labor, is strongly desired to increase. This success depends on how effectively AI makes use of capital and labor, especially labor. AI is expected to supplement human workforce rather than to take place of it. Because AI is not a natural person who has his or her autonomous will, its learning is under control of some natural person. This paper proposes a management framework for AI to supplement human workforce. By looking back the AI history, the proposed management framework integrates statistical knowledge derived from machine learning and deterministic expertise obtained from expert systems. To evaluate the effectiveness of this proposal, this paper analyses expert system and machine learning applications in auditing. It was confirmed that auditors can be assisted in making decisions on broader areas by integrating the outputs from these two approaches. © 2019 PICMET.",

The effect of the horizontal technology spillover for SMEs for international growth,2019,"The convergence of technology upgrading such as virtual reality, augmented reality, and digital and social networking platforms provides new directions and solutions for companies. The proposed research seeks to capitalise on and critically interrogate such convergence, how it works and the challenges connectivity brings for internal local life and external global markets of small to medium enterprises (SMEs). SMEs have been considered the most innovative oriented businesses in developed countries even in emerging markets acting as pioneer in the digital transformational word. It has been widely recognised that local SMEs can get advantages from multinational enterprises spillover. However, studies on the horizontal technology spillover between SMEs are scarce. In fact, there is a need to explore the effect of horizontal technology spillover on SMEs for international growth. Therefore, the research offers quantitative metrics such as technology upgrading, knowledge spillover, and technology transfer to explore this effect in the Chinese market. Especially, the empirical research is conducted on a sample of 80 SMEs in Beijing from technology – intensive industry. It critically interrogates how digital, social and transformational technologies impacts SMEs' competitiveness to produce points of digital convergence that connect, co-create and drive local to international growth via structural equation modelling. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Beijing; Emerging countries; Horizontal technology spillover; International growth; Knowledge spillover; Small to medium-sized enterprises
Aitken A.,Measuring Welfare Beyond GDP,2019,"Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is often treated as shorthand for national economic well-being, even though it was never intended to be; it is a measure of (some) of the marketable output of the economy. This paper reviews several developments in measuring welfare beyond GDP that were recently presented at the Economic Statistics Centre of Excellence (ESCoE) annual conference in May 2019. The papers discussed fall into three broad areas. First, a significant amount of work has focused on incorporating information about the distribution of income, consumption and wealth in the national accounts. Second, the effects of digitisation and the growth of the internet highlight the potential value in measuring time use as a measure of welfare. Third, the digital revolution has spawned many new, often ‘free’ goods, the welfare consequences of which are difficult to measure. Other areas, such as government services, are also difficult to measure. Measuring economic welfare properly matters because it affects the decisions made by government and society. GDP does a reasonable job of measuring the marketable output of the economy (which remains important for some policies), but it should be downgraded; more attention should be given to measures that reflect both objective and subjective measures of well-being, and measures that better reflect the heterogeneity of peoples' experiences. © 2019 National Institute of Economic and Social Research.",D31; digital economy; E01; economic measurement; GDP; I31; inequality; time use; welfare
"Tou Y., Watanabe C., Moriya K., Naveed N., Vurpillat V., Neittaanmäki P.",The transformation of R&D into neo open innovation- a new concept in R&D endeavor triggered by amazon,2019,"Amazon was the world's top Research and Development (R&D) firm in 2017. Its R&D investment was double that of 2015, five times that of 2012, and ten times that of 2011. Such a rapid and notable increase in R&D investment has raised the question of a new R&D definition and focus in the digital economy, which Amazon insists includes both “routine or periodic alterations” (traditionally classified as non-R&D) and “significant improvement” (classified as R&D). Using an empirical analysis of Amazon's R&D model as a system, this paper attempts to provide a convincing answer to this question. It has been identified that Amazon, which is based on R&D as a culture, has been promoting companywide experimentation to cause customers obsessed with making purchase decisions. This obsession has enabled Amazon to deploy an architecture for participation that makes the most of digital technologies by harnessing the power of users. Such user-driven innovation has accelerated a dramatic advancement of the Internet that, in turn, has accelerated the co-emergence of soft innovation resources in the marketplace. This emergence has activated a self-propagating function that has induced functionality development, leading to supra-functionality beyond an economic value that satisfies a shift in customers’ preferences. While this system depends on the assimilation capacity of soft innovation resources, Amazon has developed a high level of capacity supported by a rapid and notable increase in R&D investment. The above efforts function in a virtuous cycle leading to the transformation of “routine or periodic alterations” into “significant improvement.” These findings give rise to insightful suggestions regarding a new concept of R&D in neo open innovation in the digital economy. © 2019 The Authors",Amazon; Neo open innovation; R&D; Transformation; User-driven innovation

The current situation in Russia is characterized by a high degree of science lagging behind the requests of state and commercial supply chain management.Fuzzy sets have not been used to date for financial analysis and planning of chemical corporations, evaluating the investment attractiveness of securities, optimizing the stock portfolio, forecasting stock indices and macroeconomic indices. You can also talk about the lack of software based on fuzzy models, although abroad, such software products and information technologies that solve economic problems using fuzzy-plural and related descriptions already exist.In the 80's, software solutions and information technologies began to emerge, solving economic problems using fuzzy-plural and related descriptions. Thus, under the leadership of C. Zopounidis at the Technical University on the island of Crete, an expert system was developed for detailed financial analysis of corporations. A little earlier in Germany, a group led by H. Zimmerman developed a strategic planning system, in which the positioning of the corporation's business is based on fuzzy descriptions of the competitiveness and attractiveness of the business.As an example of such software, you can use expensive complex systems, which include fuzzy logic, which bankers and financiers use to solve the most complicated problems of forecasting financial indicators. The beginning of this process was laid by the Japanese financial corporation. Having set out to automate the game on the securities market, this company attracted about 30 specialists in artificial intelligence. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.",Economic and mathematical modeling; Economic theory; Economics; Innovation management; Regional economy; Supply chain strategy
"Sahban M.A., Syahchari D.H.",Assessing the Entrepreneurial Orientation Model and Linking it with Entrepreneurial Inclination among Information Systems and Computer Science Students in Indonesia,2019,"Ministry of Communication and Information, Indonesia has stated that Indonesia will become the largest digital economy player in Southeast Asia in 2020. This phenomenon can definitely trigger the digital players in Indonesia to choose online business as their career option. Therefore, there is a need to inculcate the entrepreneurial spirit of students, especially information systems and computer science students. This research work aims at analysing the Entrepreneurial Orientation by exploring its components in line with students majoring in information systems and computer science in Indonesia. It also examines the correlation between Entrepreneurial Orientation and students' preference towards entrepreneurship. Questionnaires have been distributed to the information systems and computer science students at 5 different universities in Indonesia. The hypotheses were developed after conducting the pilot testing. By using the cluster probabilistic random sampling, the 1.230 questionnaires have been distributed and this data collection process yielded back with 381 usable responses that were examined by utilizing SPSS and structural equation modelling. This study finally reveals that there are three dimensions under the Entrepreneurial Orientation variable that are risk-taking, innovativeness and proactiveness. Further, this study reveals that the EO dimensions are positively correlated with entrepreneurial intention among information systems and computer science students. This research is one of the first studies that try to exert and analyse the Entrepreneurial Orientation among information system and computer science students in Indonesia using AMOS-SEM software.

Szalavetz A.,Industry 4.0 and capability development in manufacturing subsidiaries,2019,"This paper investigates whether advanced manufacturing technologies (AMT) can modify the patterns of upgrading in manufacturing subsidiaries operating in FDI hosting factory economies. Does the digital transformation of local manufacturing engender the accumulation of local technological and R&D capabilities, or the beneficial impact of AMT remains confined to production capability? Analysis is based on primary data collected through in-depth interviews with a sample of high-flying manufacturing subsidiaries in Hungary, complemented with interviews with AMT providers. We find that AMT have spectacularly improved all components of production capability. AMT redefined the boundaries of production activities and incited a fusion of selected technological activities in production activities. AMT deployment has automated selected tacit knowledge-intensive technological activities, making the related subsidiary-level capabilities obsolete. Conversely, other local technological activities have become more knowledge-intensive than before. AMT propelled the upgrading of subsidiary-level R&D capabilities by supporting specific R&D activities and by acting as enabler of innovation collaboration. AMT created an integrated development environment and thus reduced the risks related to the decentralisation of R&D. Altogether, AMT adoption contributed to subsidiary R&D capability becoming ‘revealed’ and further upgraded through learning by doing. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Capability development; Hungary; Industry 4.0; Manufacturing subsidiary; Upgrading

Does this kind of targeting always promote transactions with high social value? We consider a model in which a two-sided platform is visited by sellers seeking to promote their products and by users with state-contingent preferences about those products. Depending on its targeting ability, the platform could be able to target users by tailored advertising banners.

"Coyle D., Nguyen D.","Cloud Computing, Cross-Border Data Flows and New Challenges for Measurement in Economics",2019,"When economists talk about ‘measurement’ they tend to refer to metrics that can capture changes in quantity, quality and distribution of goods and services. In this paper we argue that the digital transformation of the economy, particularly the rise of cloud computing as a general-purpose technology, can pose serious challenges to traditional concepts and practices of economic measurement. In the first part we show how quality-adjusted prices of cloud services have been falling rapidly over the past decade, which is currently not captured by the deflators used in official statistics. We then discuss how this enabled the spread of data-driven business models, while also lowering entry barriers to advanced production techniques such as artificial intelligence or robotic-process-automation. It is likely that these process innovations are not fully measured at present. A final challenge to measurement arises from the fragmentation of value chains across borders and increasing use of intangible intermediate inputs such as intellectual property and data. While digital technologies make it very easy for these types of inputs to be transferred within or between companies, existing economic statistics often fail to capture them at all. © 2019 National Institute of Economic and Social Research.",cloud computing; D24; data flows; E01; economic measurement; L86; national accounts; productivity
"Luthra S., Mangla S.K., Yadav G.",An analysis of causal relationships among challenges impeding redistributed manufacturing in emerging economies,2019,"Constantly increasing wages and transportation costs with market uncertainty have initiated “re-shoring” programs and the establishment of low-scale localized production for advanced economies. For the purpose, Re-distributed Manufacturing (RdM) concept emerges as an essential component especially, in emerging economies. As one of the fastest growing countries of the major world economies, India faces numerous challenges of RdM as an emerging economy which includes monetary constraints, bureaucratic regulation, lack of coordination among supply chain members, a poor digital infrastructure and a lack of standards, etc. An extensive literature review reveals limited research and methodological approaches exist concerning the challenges and causal relationships between identified challenges needed to exploit these new opportunities. In this work, twenty-one challenges to RdM in emerging economies were identified from the literature and finalized by experts' inputs. Later, this study utilizes fuzzy- Decision Making-Trial and Evaluation Laboratory Analysis technique to quantify the cause-and-effect relationships between identified challenges. ‘‘Lack of developed standards’ and ‘Lack of government policies, poor regulatory frameworks and certification programs’ have been reported as the key challenges.

"Sandvik I.M., Stubbs W.",Circular fashion supply chain through textile-to-textile recycling,2019,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the drivers, inhibitors and enablers of creating a textile-to-textile recycling system in the Scandinavian fashion industry. It investigates the technology, innovation and systemic changes required to enable circular supply chains. Design/methodology/approach: The research study uses a qualitative, interpretivist approach, drawing on in-depth semi-structured interviews with stakeholders in the Scandinavian fashion industry. Findings: The main inhibitors to textile-to-textile recycling systems in the Scandinavian fashion industry are: limited technology which creates a challenge for separating materials; high costs of research and development and building the supporting logistics; complexity of supply chains including the multitude of stakeholders involved in product development. The enablers are design and use of new materials, increased garment collection and collaboration. This research suggests that sorting and recycling technology can be enhanced with the use of digital technologies, as this would create transparency, traceability and automatisation. Research limitations/implications: The research is limited by a small sample size and lack of representation of all key stakeholder groups, which limits the ability to generalise these findings. However, as an exploratory study, the findings provide insights that can be further tested in other contexts. Originality/value: Understanding of textile-to-textile recycling is emerging both theoretically and practically, however, there is still much that is not understood. This research contributes to furthering understanding of how technology, collaboration and systemic change in the fashion industry can support opportunities for textile-to-textile recycling, thereby aligning with circular economy principles. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Circular economy; Circular fashion; Circular supply chain; Fashion industry; Textile recycling; Textile/clothing supply chains
Lang L.,“Sometimes you don’t know how to move” cultural savviness and learning the ropes of bureaucracy,2019,"Purpose: Recent works by organisational anthropologists have identified bureaucracy as a major challenge for unskilled workers in the global economy. Daily encounters with bureaucratic processes only enhance general feelings of inadequacy, frustration and insecurity experienced by social groups who have to rely on precarious work. However, a focus on people’s homespun strategies and on the role of the non-profit sector in helping them to navigate bureaucracy is still incipient. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: The research, ethnographic in its approach, unveils some of these challenges by drawing on 29 interviews with migrant workers in a third sector organisation in Manchester, UK. It explores migrants’ work experiences and aspirations, and the strategies used to navigate the bureaucracy embedded in the organisation of their lives. Informed by the different roles the researcher performed at the centre and by the inter-disciplinary nature of the projects, the methodology includes interviews, participative observation, analysis of life story narratives and drawings, and participation in community workshops. Findings: While acknowledging that bureaucracy can keep people in liminal spaces and enhance their sense of insecurity, this paper reveals how personal aspirations and the ability to make connections across different social networks provide the much needed drive that enables migrants to acquire language skills, a tool that helps them to learn the ropes of bureaucratic processes, become culturally savvy, and leave the stage of quasi-citizenship. Originality/value: Responses highlight the significance of recent welfare reforms and reveal adaptive mechanisms to deal with resulting uncertainties, which include the use of a variety of social networks, learning hew digital and language skills, and seeking specialized knowledge found in organisations in the third sector. The study also questions the taken-for-granted rationality of bureaucracy, unveiling its messy and ambiguous logic. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Bureaucracy; Citizenship; Cultural savviness; Liminality; Migrants; Precarity
Ito A.,Digital China: A Fourth Industrial Revolution with Chinese Characteristics?,2019,"This paper examines both the universal features and unique aspects of China’s digitalization process. The impact of digitalization, domestically and in other Asian countries, is also explored. China’s digital economy has grown rapidly since the end of the first decade of the 21st century, and compared to other countries with similar levels of economic development, China has a high rate of use of digital services. China’s digitalization process is driven by both private companies and by the state’s strategic initiatives, including social governance. China faces both opportunities and risks from digitalization. Workers in rural areas as well as older workers may face a higher risk of job loss through automation in the future. Chinese IT companies are eager to expand their activities both domestically and in foreign countries, and their investments in so-called “unicorn” companies in Southeast Asia are especially noteworthy. © 2019, © 2019 Nakasone Peace Institute.",
McKinnon R.,Introduction: Social security and the digital economy – Managing transformation,2019,"This special issue of the International Social Security Review considers the multidisciplinary topic of social security and the digital economy. The selected articles that comprise this issue offer a number of varying perspectives on the changing and increasingly complex environment in which social security institutions operate and critically assess not only how social security institutions are likely to be impacted but also how they may respond to the challenges foreseen. Social security institutions do not have control over external factors that can negatively impact the financing and coverage of social security programmes. Nonetheless, with the shift to the digital economy, the task at hand is to manage an unprecedented process of change. Though ensuring service continuity is the primary concern, also required are improvements in service delivery for all stakeholders and the development of responses to meet new operational challenges and emerging coverage risks. Particularly in more developed economies, the socio-economic challenges that accompany the labour market changes associated with the transition to the digital economy are often characterized as presenting a risk of growing precarity. Regardless, the global policy goal remains one of ensuring sustainable and adequate social security protection for all. © 2019 International Social Security Association",coverage; international; labour market; social security administration

The new ""non-producing classes"" get formed in a situation of new historical conditions the coordinates of which cover the entire global world, and it can be spoken definitely that problems of the Russian society are determined, among other things, by trends of the ""world information community"", with the former being a part of it nowadays. The paper outlines the main vectors of the problem of socialization of the disabled children in the contemporary Russian society within the context of information economy forming. Particularities of integration of children having disabilities are shown in the logic of development of the world social inequality processes based on the ""digital divide"" approaches. Proceeding from the Russian statistical materials, some suppositions are made about possible negative development scenarios of the present-day cohort of children having functional limitations who can become outsiders of the digital revolution and man the strata of non-producing classes if there are no state programs, education strategies, pedagogical personnel and focused work with parents. © 2019 Michail V.

Greve B.,The digital economy and the future of European welfare states,2019,"As a consequence of new technology, labour markets are changing. This article’s central aim is to discuss variations among welfare states in Europe to adjust to changing labour markets. These variations in adjustment suggest that some welfare states are more prepared than others, including their capacity to ensure their sustainable financing. In the years to come, the predicted impact of technological development on labour markets will be huge. Impacts will include stronger “dualization” and new cleavages between “insiders” and “outsiders”. Fewer industrial jobs are to be expected, and service-sector employment faces a risk of decline due to automation. While the creation of new jobs is likely, it remains to be seen whether these will replace the number of jobs destroyed, leaving the risk that many people whose skills become obsolete will become unemployed in the short as well as the longer term. Furthermore, even if the same number of jobs are eventually created, there will be a period of transition. In the light of this, welfare states will be challenged, not only in how they can finance their activities but also in terms of the threat posed to social cohesion by emerging labour market “winners” and “losers”, with an accompanying higher risk of increasing inequality. The article offers suggestions as to how welfare states may cope with the changes related to the financing of welfare states, and how active labour market policy can be part of the response to help alleviate the expected dramatic changes. Also required is a discussion on the annual average number of hours people will work and how this might be a factor in lower future levels of unemployment. © 2019 International Social Security Association",dualization of society; Europe; labour market; technological change; welfare state

This economy is transforming capitalism and raising important questions about its nature. Is it a new process of embeddedness or is it the next step for deregulation following the crisis of the financialised regime of accumulation (RA)? Is it a possible new Growth Regime? Using the approach of the French Régulation school of thought, we describe the nature and transformations of the form of competition inherent in platforms. Although this may favour some forms of re-embeddedness, we show that it will accelerate some of the trends and characteristics of the institutional forms of the financialised RA and that it is an endogenous product of its crisis. This raises further questions and uncertainties related to the ability of platforms to generate stable long run growth due to the dysfunctionality of the mode of régulation and the conflicts it could generate. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

We estimate productivity with a production function approach, and test whether three measures of agglomeration—namely, specialization, diversity, and density—affect the productivity of firms in creative industries. According to our results, that the density elasticity of productivity is 0.31, which suggests that agglomeration economies matter for creative industries. Urbanization economies resulting from diversity in service industries are the main source of agglomeration economies, but there is no specialization effect after controlling for firm size, ownership, and industry concentration. Further, availability of communication, represented by digital access and transportation convenience, boosts knowledge spillovers and thus enhances urbanization economies.

In the wake of automation and digitalization, new forms of employment have been emerging in various occupations and sectors, such as the digital platform economy. The emergence of new forms of employment, such as work on digital platforms, requires that existing social protection systems adapt to the specific situation and needs of such workers, as to realize the human right to social security for all. Current social protection coverage for workers on digital crowdwork platforms reveals significant gaps in social security coverage. Where such coverage exists, it is often provided through the workers’ previous or additional jobs, or indirectly through their spouses or other family members. This raises questions about digital platforms free riding on the traditional economy with regard to the financing of social security. How can social protection systems adapt to changing forms of work to ensure full and effective coverage for workers in all forms of employment, including those in “new” forms of employment? How can workers in all types of employment, including those on digital platforms, be protected in an adequate and comprehensive way, combining contributory and non-contributory mechanisms and based on equitable and sustainable financing mechanisms, so as to ensure adequate social protection to all?. © 2019 International Social Security Association",coverage; ILO; international; labour market; social protection

The requirement for introducing corporate social responsibility is explained primarily by the companies’ growing awareness of their obligations to society. Companies in the modern world tend to do business with due account of the current social tasks and issues. Those businesses that do consider the implications of their operations make corporate social responsibility their strategic priority. The pioneers in corporate social responsibility, who were the first to speak openly on the topic, were Mr. G. Swope, President of General Electric, and Mr. W. Gifford, President of American Telephone and Telegraph Company. The idea of the social responsibility of business has spread all over the world and was adopted by many companies, resulting in the emergence of the concept of corporate social responsibility. Today, business is a valid corporate citizen exercising its influence on the social, economic and political environment. As such, it may not allow itself to neglect the social background of its activities since it may result in the deterioration of its public image and the way it is perceived by its consumers and investors. © BEIESP.",Concept of social responsibility; Digital economy; Evolution of accounting methods and procedures; Standardization; Synergistic approach

"Starkey L., Eppel E.",Digital data in New Zealand schools: Policy reform and school leadership,2019,"In 1989, New Zealand started to follow an international trend of reforming education policy according to the neoliberal principles of competition, choice and self-managing schools. Since then, the increasing availability of digital data in schools has corresponded with the development of student achievement measurement tools and benchmarking of standards that enable comparison of schools and cohorts of students. More recently, national policy targets for student achievement have been introduced and form the basis of accountability measures. The article uses Hargreaves and Shirley’s ‘Four Ways’ characterisation of education policy change as a framework to examine the influence that national policy has had on the use of data, on power relations between schools and the national policymakers, and on the challenges faced by school leaders. Interviews in 16 schools explored the types of data available in each school, how they are used and how principals, as leaders in these self-managing schools, would like to be able to use the data. Two systemic influences explain the patterns found in the research. The first is the tension principals face between data required for accountability reporting and data needed for school-based decision-making. The second is the issue with regard to economies of scale and marketisation of education that affects equitable access to the knowledge, tools and expertise that enable effective data usage. © The Author(s) 2017.",Digital data; education policy; New Zealand; reform; schooling

From a competition policy perspective, however, the question emerges whether a firm's data ‘treasure’ can be the source of competitive advantage that make sit very unlikely or even impossible for other firms to catch up in the foresee able future. While digital platforms have injected competition into manymarkets, there is also an increased risk of market foreclosureby large platforms due to the tippy ‘winner-takes-all’ nature of these markets. © 2019, ZBW and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",

"Ferrer-Gomila J.-L., Francisca Hinarejos M., Isern-Deyà A.-P.",A fair contract signing protocol with blockchain support,2019,"Electronically signing contracts is fundamental for e-commerce transactions. The main property that contract signing protocols must achieve is fairness of the exchange. The solutions presented to date are divided into two major types: those that have a trusted third party (TTP) to achieve fairness and those that do not. In the literature, we find more than 40 published proposals, but none of these proposed protocols has become a recognized or de facto standard in the market. Blockchain has provided a new way to address classic problems such as double spending, as well as problems such as fairness. In this article, we present a protocol for contract signing based on blockchain. Our proposed protocol does not require a conventional TTP, and it does not present the disadvantages of solutions without a TTP (computational and/or communication cost). The protocol satisfies the necessary security requirements: fairness, timeliness and non-repudiation. We demonstrate the feasibility of the protocol with a cost analysis and a proof of concept implementation. In addition, we show how Ethereum can be integrated in our solution as an alternative platform to the use of Bitcoin. Finally, we show how our proposal improves previous solutions for contract signing based on blockchain in terms of cost, efficiency and security. © 2019 The Authors",Bitcoin; Blockchain; Contract signing; Cryptocurrency; Digital economy; Digitalization; E-commerce; Ethereum; Fair exchange; Fintech; Trust; Trust-free system

"Moreno-Brieva F., Marín R.",Technology generation and international collaboration in the Global Value Chain of Lithium Batteries,2019,"The Global Value Chain (GVC) literature generally highlights the opportunities for developing economies to be found in technological upgrading – although the generation of technology tends to be associated with the highest added-value stages, what could be a limiting aspect in those chains based primarily on natural resources. The case of lithium batteries allows analysis of the trade-off between technology generation and international collaboration, as well as any potential asymmetries between producers of natural resources and end-use products within the same GVC. Lithium is a relevant component, currently seen as a valuable player in the reduction of fossil fuel emissions, given the potential of lithium batteries for energy storage, in final applications ranging from consumer electronics to electric vehicles. Our findings show a divergent relationship between lithium producers and related technologies at the country level, across the different stages of the Global Value Chain for Lithium Batteries (GVCLB), and this suggests that upgrading throughout the value chain could foster imbalances. Empirical analysis has been conducted using data from patent applications made to the European Patent Office, and the findings reveal wide international divergence and numerous interactions within the GVCLB, defining a complex international pattern of collaboration, with technology generation concentrated into very few economies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Competitiveness; Global Value Chain; International connectivity; Knowledge generation; Lithium batteries; Patents

Even though the global sustainability and circular economy agendas require that buildings must have minimal impact on the environment across the entire lifecycle. In this study therefore, a disassembly and deconstruction analytics system is developed to provide buildings’ end-of-life performance assessment from the design stage. The system architecture builds on the existing building information modelling capabilities in managing building design and construction process. The architecture is made up of four different layers namely (i) Data storage layer, (ii) Semantic layer, (iii) Analytics and functional models layer and (iv) Application layer. The four layers are logically connected to function as a single system. Three key functionalities of the disassembly and deconstruction analytics system namely (i) Building Whole Life Performance Analytics (ii) Building Element Deconstruction Analytics and (iii) Design for Deconstruction Advisor are implemented as plug-in in Revit 2017. Three scenarios of a case study building design were used to test and evaluate the performance of the system. The results show that building information modelling software capabilities can be extended to provide a platform for assessing the performance of building designs in respect of the circular economy principle of keeping the embodied energy of materials perpetually in an economy. The disassembly and deconstruction analytics system would ensure that buildings are designed with design for disassembly and deconstruction principles that guarantee efficient materials recovery in mind. The disassembly and deconstruction analytics tool could also serve as a decision support platform that government and planners can use to evaluate the level of compliance of building designs to circular economy and sustainability requirements. © 2019",Building information modelling (BIM); Circular economy; Design for deconstruction; Design for disassembly; Disassembly and deconstruction analytics (D-DAS); End-of-Life

"Oesterreich T.D., Teuteberg F.",The role of business analytics in the controllers and management accountants’ competence profiles: An exploratory study on individual-level data,2019,"Purpose: In recent years, the rise of big data has led to an obvious shift in the competence profile expected from the controller and management accountant (MA). Among others, business analytics competences and information technology skills are considered a “must have” capability for the controlling and MA profession. As it still remains unclear if these requirements can be fulfilled by today’s employees, the purpose of this study is to examine the supply of business analytics competences in the current competence profiles of controlling professionals in an attempt to answer the question whether or not a skills gap exists. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a set of 2,331 member profiles of German controlling professionals extracted from the business social network XING, a text analytics approach is conducted to discover patterns out of the semi-structured data. In doing so, the second purpose of this study is to encourage researchers and practitioners to integrate and advance big data analytics as a method of inquiry into their research process. Findings: Apart from the mediating role of gender, company size and other variables, the results indicate that the current competence profiles of the controller do not comply with the recent requirements towards business analytics competences. However, the answer to the question whether a skills gap exist must be made cautiously by taking into account the specific organizational context such as level of IT adoption or the degree of job specialization. Research limitations/implications: Guided by the resource-based view of the firm, organizational theory and social cognitive theory, an explanatory model is developed that helps to explain the apparent skills gap, and thus, to enhance the understanding towards the rationales behind the observed findings. One major limitation to be mentioned is that the data sample integrated into this study is restricted to member profiles of German controlling professionals from foremost large companies. Originality/value: The insights provided in this study extend the ongoing debate in accounting literature and business media on the skills changes of the controlling and MA profession in the big data era. The originality of this study lies in its explicit attempt to integrate recent advances in data analytics to explore the self-reported competence supplies of controlling professionals based on a comprehensive set of semi-structured data. A theoretically founded explanatory model is proposed that integrates empirically validated findings from extant research across various disciplines. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Big data; Big data text analytics; Business analytics; Business social network; Content analytics; Controlling change; Management accounting change; Management accounting in the digital economy; Social media analytics

"Nuccio M., Guerzoni M.",Big data: Hell or heaven? Digital platforms and market power in the data-driven economy,2019,"Digital transformation has triggered a process of concentration in several markets for information goods with digital platforms rising to dominate key industries by leveraging on network externalities and economies of scale in the use of consumer data. The policy debate, therefore, focuses on the market control allegedly held by incumbents who build their competitive advantage on big data. In this paper, we evaluate the risk of abuse of a dominant position by analysing three major aspects highlighted in economic theory: entry barriers, price discrimination, and potential for technological improvement. Drawing on industrial and information economics, we argue that the very nature of big data, on the one hand, prompts market concentration and, on the other, limits the possibility of abuse. This claim is not an a-priori apologia of large incumbents in digital markets, but rather an attempt to argue that market concentration is not necessarily detrimental when it stimulates continuous innovation. Nonetheless, the concentration of power in a few global players should raise other concerns linked with the supranational nature of these firms, which can easily cherry-pick locations to exploit tax competition among countries or more favourable privacy legislation and the fair use of data. © The Author(s) 2018.",big data; Digital economy; digital platforms; entry barriers; innovation; price discrimination

"Rani U., Furrer M.",On-Demand Digital Economy: Can Experience Ensure Work and Income Security for Microtask Workers?,2019,"Digital labour platforms have been increasingly gaining popularity over the past decade. In particular, there has been much debate about workers' motivations and working conditions on microtask platforms. There exists little evidence on whether dependence on digital microtask platforms provides workers with work and income security in the long term and whether it provides opportunities for skill development. This paper explores the extent to which the seemingly flexible platform work ensures work and income security and provides opportunities for skill development for workers with different levels of experience, based on novel survey data collected on five globally operating microtask platforms and in-depth interviews with workers. The findings show that despite high financial dependence on this work, returns to experience on the platform are meagre in terms of earnings, and highly experienced workers face the same risks as new entrants with regard to discrimination, high work intensity, lack of autonomy and control over work, and social protection. There is also a skills gap between the nature of tasks available on these microtask platforms and the workers' education levels. Finally, experience does not ensure that workers have the opportunities to undertake complex and challenging tasks, and the possibilities to develop their skills and improve career prospects are limited. © 2019 Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag GmbH, Published by De Gruyter Oldenbourg, Berlin/Boston 2019.",crowdwork; digital labour; education; learning; online platforms; skills; working conditions

Most of these market organizations incorporate decentralized evaluation systems into their digital platform. However, these market organizations involve users and organizers with different ideas on what is valuable and what is not in sharing-economy transactions. Building on neo-institutional insights coupled with French pragmatist sociology, we investigate the role of decentralized evaluation systems in supporting/solving the co-existence and/or competition of several conceptions of worth in market organizations of the sharing economy. In a case study on the French peer-to-peer carpooling platform BlaBlaCar, we show that its decentralized evaluation system embodies the organizer's conception of what is valuable and only supports limited pluralism among users. We argue that incorporating a decentralized evaluation system in the digital platform of a market organization is not neutral: certain users prefer to self-exclude rather than to use the system to discriminate between potential future interlocutors. Although evaluations do not incorporate imposed criteria, they constitute proofs of worth in some worlds but not in others. Finally, this evaluation system creates room for several market organizations to co-exist. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",BlaBlaCar; Evaluation system; Institutional logics; Market organization; Orders of worth; Sharing economy

"Clauss T., Harengel P., Hock M.",The perception of value of platform-based business models in the sharing economy: determining the drivers of user loyalty,2019,"Platform-based business models have become such an essential pillar of today’s economy that the term ‘sharing economy’ is now frequently used to describe the new status quo. The success of platforms such as Airbnb, Blablacar or Shpock is evidence of a seismic shift from an ownership society to a sharing society. However, only very few platforms are able to accumulate a large and loyal following of customers. When success hinges upon engagement, a large user base can make or break one of these platforms. In our research we approach this challenge by researching platform loyalty from a customer-centric perspective. We show the impact of different value perceptions for customer-to-customer-based platforms through the use of a variance-based structural equation model. By demonstrating how customer perception of emotional value and quality value drive the loyalty of the platform, we are able to show that factors other than price determine loyal usage among platform-based business models. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Business model; Customer value perception; Digital innovation; Loyalty; Partial least squares; Sharing economy; Two-sided platforms
"Mönnig A., Maier T., Zika G.",Economy 4.0 - Digitalisation and Its Effect on Wage Inequality,2019,"This paper contributes to the discussion of the impact of digital transformation on labour markets by analysing the impact on wage inequality. The novelty of this paper is on the one hand the quantitative approach that applies a macroeconometric input-output model which accounts for circular flow in the economy and feedback loops. Most of the studies on wage inequality and digital transformation focus on ex-post analysis. The applied quantitative model used in this paper also allows to perform ex-ante analysis. This is important, as economy 4.0 is not yet reflected in current datasets which makes statements about the impact of economy 4.0 on wage inequality on basis of ex-post analysis difficult. On the other hand, it uses the inequality measures S80/S20 that has been applied to a unique dataset on employment and wages. The dataset differentiates on industry and occupational level. That allows to identify industry∗occupation combination and their location in the upper and/or lower 20-% share ratio of wage distribution. The analysis demonstrates that digital transformation increases wage inequality, however to a low extent. The increase in wage inequality is already implemented in the reference scenario due to structural and demographic change. Digital transformation strengthens the impact of structural change on wage inequality. Especially in the long run, wage inequality rises stronger than in the reference scenario. Because the digital transformation scenario does not confirm the polarization hypothesis, the impact of economy 4.0 on wage inequality remains rather low. The increasing demand of high-skilled employees is reflected in an increase in wage inequality. However, the relatively low impact of digitalisation on low-skilled employees prevents a stronger increase in wage inequality. © 2019 Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag GmbH, Published by De Gruyter Oldenbourg, Berlin/Boston 2019.",digitalisation; projection; scenario analysis; wage inequality

"Shafiei Gol E., Stein M.-K., Avital M.",Crowdwork platform governance toward organizational value creation,2019,"Crowdwork, a new form of digitally mediated employment and part of the so-called gig economy, has the capacity to change the nature of work organization and to provide strategic value to workers, job providers, and intermediary platform owners. However, because crowdwork is temporary, large-scale, distributed, and mediated, its governance remains a challenge that often casts a shadow over its strategic value. The objective of this paper is to shed light on the making of value-adding crowdwork arrangements. Specifically, the paper explores crowdwork platform governance mechanisms and the relationships between these mechanisms and organizational value creation. Building on a comprehensive review of the extant literature on governance and crowdwork, we construct an overarching conceptual model that integrates control system and coordination system as two complementary mechanisms that drive crowdwork platform governance effectiveness and the consequent job provider benefits. Furthermore, the model accentuates the role of the degree of centralization and the degree of routinization as critical moderators in crowdwork platform governance. Overall, the paper highlights the potential of crowdwork to contribute not only to inclusion, fair wages and flexible work arrangements for workers but also to organizations’ value and competitive edge. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Centralized platforms; Crowdwork; Decentralized platforms; Digital economy; Gig economy; Governance; Literature review; Organizational value; Work organization

"Artamonova M., Bredikhina O., Gusev V., Voskanyan O., Guchok Z., Buhteeva Y.",Financial aspects of digitalization in the tourism industry,2019,"Each large segment of the market is developing in digital technologies, using them in order to increase sales, brand awareness and create certain trends related to the activities of the company or organization. Tourism, as well as all other players on the world stage, considers digital technologies as the shortest and most effective way to its customers. In the field of tourism, digital promotion is especially important as the end user can be thousands of kilometers from the route of his journey. Today, 3.5 billion people have access to the Internet. This number includes people of all age groups, with different wages and social status. This indicator is growing every year. If earlier it was believed that the Internet is mainly used by young people, at the moment more and more adults and elderly people, especially abroad, use social networks every day and use the Internet to search for information. © 2019.

Fiorentino S.,The Maker Faire of Rome as a window of observation on the new perspectives for local economic development and the new urban entrepreneurial ecosystems,2019,"The rise of the Maker Movement – representing small businesses active in the digital fabrication and the creative industry field – is indicative of the emergence of a new type of urban economy and labour regulations in many cities. Trade fairs have been central to the dynamics of these makers as well as an institutional tool to build an economic reputation for the place hosting them. This paper draws upon a survey of exhibitors at, and interviews with organizers of, the Maker Faire of Rome 2015 to describe the features of this unfolding entrepreneurial world. The findings indicate that, although cities are once again the nexus of contemporary innovation trends, these are deeply intertwined with the surrounding socio-political context. Specifically, and in some contrast to the extant literature on creativity, the Rome case indicates the salience of Makers to those urban economies most in need of regeneration. © The Author(s) 2019.",cities; entrepreneurs; makers; trade fairs; urban economies
Cascio W.F.,"Training trends: Macro, micro, and policy issues",2019,"The scope of the training enterprise is vast, the field is dynamic, and multi-level issues confront training researchers. After identifying three “mega trends” – globalization, technology, and demographic changes - this paper reviews training trends at the macro level, the micro level, and emerging policy issues and links each one to the mega trends. The macro-level trends - increasing demands for personal and professional development by job seekers and employees, the effects of digital technology on work, structural changes in labor markets, increasing training opportunities for non-standard workers, and training as an important aspect of an employer's brand - reflect broad trends in the economy. Micro-level trends - better understanding of requirements for effective learning; use of short, digital lessons; and options for optimizing learning and preventing skill and knowledge decay - each focus on improving the quality of training. Policy issues - training needs in small and medium-sized enterprises, the need for “middle skills”, and vocational education - raise vexing issues for all stakeholders. Together, macro, micro, and policy issues reflect ongoing challenges for researchers, practitioners, and policy makers everywhere. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Demographic changes; Digital technology and work; Globalization; Labor markets; Micro-learning; Middle skills; Non-standard workers; Training trends; Vocational education
"Saǧ S., Sezen B., Alpkan L.",Determinants of Open Innovation and their Interrelations,2019,"Based on an extensive literature review, this paper identifies nine erosion factors that lead to the birth of open innovation and discovers their interrelations by using Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM). As a result, digital technologies and globalization emerged as major drivers. More interestingly, erosion factors proposed by leading open innovation scholars emerged as weak drivers, meaning that open innovation is driven by other factors. We argue that a better understanding of these factors and their interrelations provide valuable insights for managers and policy makers in emerging markets on facilitating the adoption of open innovation and promoting a more open business environment. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.",emerging economies; Innovation; Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM); open innovation
Borges F.,Soccer clubs as media organizations: A case study of Benfica TV and PSG TV,2019,"The sport/media complex is a very dynamic system in which actors are constantly negotiating positions and power relations. Historically, sport organizations and media companies have had a symbiotic relationship, and the boundaries between them have been fluid. First, media companies acted as sport organizations' storytellers, but after the digital revolution, it became easier for sport organizations to enter the media market. Concerned with revenues, soccer clubs decided to take responsibility for exploring their image and promoting intellectual property. Initially advancing with marketing and public relations departments, they later created television or othermedia channels. The creation of club-ownedmedia established an environment where a soccer club can act as a media organization. This case study is based on an examination of Benfica TV, in Portugal, and PSGTV, in France, to seek to understand their motivations and to assess the existence of a similar business model or motivation. An ethnographic-interview methodology was used in an attempt to understand the inner parts of the clubs that are frequently restricted. © 2019 Human Kinetics, Inc.",Club-owned media; Mediatization; New-media economy; Sport/media complex
"Vinogradova E., Tsvetkova L., Orlaniuk-Malitskaia L.",Development of the risk insurance zone for high-tech enterprises,2019,"The concept of the study is connected with the development of the insurance market as the result of innovative improvement of methods and techniques in the activities of insurance companies and also synchronous changes in the properties of consumers of insurance services. The use of high-tech, innovative tools, and techniques in the insurance business require the consumer's ability to function in such an environment, and, conversely, insurers' high-tech activities should cause the use of appropriate insurance techniques. This study proposes the concept of formation and development of the insurance market in the new conditions of the digital economy and the use of high technologies, as well as methodological and practical recommendations for the development of the risk insurance zone of the enterprise. The relevance of this topic is determined by a lack of the development of those segments of the insurance market, which are adapted to the individual needs of enterprise risk management, while insurance companies focus on life, health and disability insurance of citizens. Risk insurance of large enterprises is an exceptional method of preserving the continuity of the production process. The economic situation is characterized by crises in all sectors of production and involves the use of a variety of economic mechanisms and measures to overcome the crisis. However, insurance is able to provide financial and production stability in almost all areas of production. In the conditions of continuous innovative development and expansion of possible damages due to the density of enterprises and the emergence of new risks, innovative methods of risk insurance deserve special attention, since insurance is the exclusive and most effective means of compensation for possible damage. The purpose of this study is to study the development of the risk insurance zone of high-tech enterprises; to propose ways for the development of methodology of the risk insurance zone of high-tech enterprises; to find a methodology to assess the effectiveness of risk insurance as a tool for innovation. In this study, the proposals for risk assessment and the selection of risk insurance are made. We have described how companies should measure their risks, and we propose ways to eliminate ""non-core"" risks through insurance, which increases the capabilities of the enterprise in the market. As a result of research and application of studied and techniques described in the article, the ERM strategy is proposed so that the enterprise can efficiently use insurance to significantly increase the added value while minimizing risk. © 2019 Islamic Azad University.",Enterprise Risk Management; ERM; High-tech Enterprise; Innovation Risks; Insurance

Characteristics which present unique challenges for these communities attempting to develop tourism as a way of diversifying their economy. This study explored the views and experiences from residents and businesses in six remote local government areas in South Western Queensland to identify the barriers and enablers for remote communities to using tourism as a driver of economic and social-cultural growth. We found a lack of understanding of the structure and behaviour of the tourism industry; a lack of business acumen; a lack of financial and human resources; and a reluctance to collaborate by tourism businesses to be barriers to tourism-led economic growth. Enablers to tourism led growth included: local government support for tourism development; a sound understanding of the mechanics and structure of the tourism industry; and the capacity to engage in marketing that captured and narrated the visitor experience in digital channels. © 2019 The Economic Society of Australia",community development; economic development; tourism; tourism development
Rathnakar G.,Blockchain marketing through social media surges the economic growth of India,2019,"The objective of the study is to magnitude the social media in blockchain marketing, dealing with their business partners and how they reaches to millions of potential customers, and highlight how blockchain can affect social media marketing. So, as blockchain impacts the global economy, what effects does it have on social media advertising? And offer the recommendations to the society while working with the social media. Change is inevitable; cut throat competition has shrunk the profit margin but the monopoly. To take the product or services at global level, traditional approach is not enough; we look for innovative and creative idea to reach millions to register our product or services in their mind and blockchain helps to take a big leap in the world of digital marketing. Technology companies have come up with novel idea of connecting the people. Users started registering and getting connected with others having same interest, demography and various professions or hobbies. This networking ultimately expanded in to a huge circle, a big family with different taste and interest. Now, using such a huge network, to penetrate the brand and idea of promoting the product/services or feedback or demand or quality or need or want of the people came in existence. Showing their needs and wants made the supplier to rethink about their product and services and in turn it has immensely increased the brand value, goodwill and most important the bigger customer base and customer loyalty. This is a platform for any individual or SME or corporate to present new ideas and reach to millions with not much investment as compare to traditional approach, which is much more expensive affairs. © BEIESP.",Blockchain Marketing; Bulletin Board Systems; Growth factor; Internet Relay Chat; SME; Social Media; Social Media Technology
"Taylor A., Bronstone A.","People, place and global order: Foundations of a networked political economy",2019,"Globalization and technology are combining to change socio-economic relationships. The pace of change and uncertainty of the world of work - no job for life, zero-hours contracts, diminished pension rights and a growing delivery dependence on digital networks over human contact - are creating a profound unease that may be unprecedented in the Western world. If organizational patterns are not sufficiently adjusted and businesses continue as usual, we run the risk of alienating entire groups within society with many feeling 'left behind'. Using deliberately accessible language for students and the general reader, the authors draw upon socially innovative models of economic organization from the nineteenth century to present a model to master this new economy for the common good.

Evans G.L.,Emergence of a digital cluster in east London: birth of a new hybrid firm,2019,"Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the composition and geography of an emerging “creative digital” cluster in London, in the context of cluster theory and emerging creative cluster concepts. This argues that this cluster cannot be divorced from the wider regional creative and digital economy and that its inter-dependence with a small number of “content” industries is critical to its formation. The significance of the “creative digital” firm blending design, communications and technological development is highlighted, as is its unique position in enabling such firms to flourish. Design/methodology/approach: The research combines both quantitative with qualitative methods, based on cluster analysis of firm-level business data using GIS mapping software at a regional level; location quotient (LQ) analysis to reveal firm concentration at a local cluster level; an online questionnaire survey of firms within this cluster; participant observation of firm meet-ups over a three-year period; and face-to-face interviews with a sample of firms/owners. Findings: The evidence generated from this research confirms the distinctive nature of this digital cluster and the benefits of co-location in an industrial district with proximities to a range of advanced producer services and cultural content provision. This has revealed an emerging “techno-creative habitus” (Scott 2010), which has been able to take advantage of market fluidity through a network of communities of interest firms, which have reshaped an existing global hub locally anchored by a highly porous locale. Originality/value: The research is novel in combining spatial data analysis with qualitative research into firm behaviour and place-based factors that support the growth of this cluster. This has revealed new insights into the hybrid nature of tech firms that integrate content with both hardware and software applications and who innovate and grow through inter-personal cluster networks. This contributes to cluster theory and extends the range of proximities – social, institutional and cultural – that enhance the geographic advantages of clustering in this case. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Creative clusters; Creative-digital hybrid firm; Digital Shoreditch; Tech city
"Jabagi N., Croteau A.-M., Audebrand L.K., Marsan J.",Gig-workers’ motivation: thinking beyond carrots and sticks,2019,"Purpose: High-quality employee motivation can contribute to an organization’s long-term success by supporting employees’ well-being and performance. Nevertheless, there is a paucity of research concerning how organizations motivate workers in non-traditional work contexts. In the algocratic context of the gig-economy, the purpose of this paper is to understand the role that technology can play in motivating workers. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on the self-determination theory, job-characteristic theory and enterprise social media research, this conceptual paper explores how the architecture of the digital labor platforms underlying the gig-economy (and the characteristics of jobs mediated through these IT artifacts) can impact key antecedents of self-motivation. Findings: Combining theory and empirical evidence, this paper develops a mid-range theory demonstrating how organizations can support the self-motivation of gig-workers through the thoughtful design of their digital labor platforms and the integration of two social media tools (namely, social networking and social badging). Research limitations/implications: This paper answers calls for psychologically-based research exploring the consequences of gig-work as well as research studying the impacts of advanced technologies in interaction with work contexts on motivation. In theorizing around a large set of social-contextual variables operating at different levels of analysis, this paper demonstrates that individual-level motivation can be influenced by both task-based and organizational-level factors, in addition to individual-level factors. Originality/value: The proposed theory provides novel insight into how gig-organizations can leverage widely accessible social media technology to motivate platform workers in the absence of human supervision and support.

In particular, it investigates how digital platforms, intended both as providers of technological features and online environments, affect this process. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted an exploratory field study and collected data from 46 interviews with freelancers working on one of the most popular online labor markets and from online documents such as public profiles, job applications and archival data. Findings: The findings reveal that the online environment constrains the action of workers who are pushed to take advantage of the platform’s technological features to succeed. This interplay leads workers to add new characteristics to their work-self and to and to develop an entrepreneurial an entrepreneurial orientation. Practical implications: The study offers insights to platform providers interested in improving workers’ experiences in online labor markets, highlighting mechanisms for uncertainty reduction and diversifying a platform’s services according to gig workers’ identities and orientations.

The subject seems of topical research interest because of digitalization of Russian economy. The main trend is the conversion of traditional business forms to the virtual space. Social networks become both a favourite leisure activity for people today and a place of competition between companies. The ability and skills to use effectively different SMM-tools are a competitive advantage of the company. In addition, to attracting people's attention to a product or service via the Internet is less expensive compared to traditional advertising.The aim of the presented study is to determine the place and role of SMM-tools in the promotion of small and medium-sized business. This aim includes the following objectives:•analyze and make a segmentation of the regional market to examine the possibility of using SMM technologies;•examine the process of community management and blogging in popular social networks;•analyze the features of targeted advertising and work with analytics;•describe the target audience;•develop rules for designing a content-plan;•determine the criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of SMM.The empirical research is based on the promotion experience of Nizhny Novgorod companies. In theoretical part of the report the latest literature on Internet advertising and SMM is reviewed. As research methods both general scientific and special methods such as SWOT-analysis, sociological survey, observation are used.In the course of the study a local market segmentation was carried out, SMM promotion prospects were determined, a social portrait of the target audience was described, the main communication channels with the consumer in the Internet were analyzed, and the SMM-promotion algorithm was developed.Unlike other advertising tools, the Internet makes possible to attract real customers with a minimum or zero budget. Nowadays, when people in Russia spend 10 hours per week in the Internet, the prospects for SMM-technologies in our country are obvious.The results of the study show that SMM also solves an important problem of company's personalization. It makes them as close to the target audience as possible. Thanks to integration of information about themselves in the user's news feed, the business gets a high social approval and positive feedback from the client, which could guarantee the high rates of profit in the future. © 2019 IEEE.",communication; content plan; digital economy; Internet advertising; marketing; promotion; Social media marketing (SMM); social networks; target audience; targeted advertising

Cashless economy is the future of Indian economy where there will be no physical flow of cash. All the payments will be made and received in the virtual world. Cashless economy got popular after demonetization where plastic money was widely used. The study is aimed towards studying the level of awareness among the citizens about cashless economy. The study also helps in determining the factors which influence the people to switch from cash towards cashless payments and what are the benefits people avail by using other means of payments.The primary data was collected by distributing questionnaires to 280 respondents, who have been using any digital mode of payment. Data is collected from students, working professionals and business class people. The questionnaire asks questions about the benefits people avail while using digital payment methods and what are the various factors which influence the people to use digital payment methods and what are the risks they face associated with digital payments.After the research conducted we can say that the working professionals and business class people use digital payment methods more. There are various factors which influence the people to shift such as offers, cashback etc. There is still a long run for India to be cashless to full extent as the government needs to develop a smooth and secure infrastructure. © BEIESP.",Cashless economy; Demonetization; Digital payment methods; Technological development

"Radhakrishnan R., Ramachandran G.S., Krishnamachari B.",SDPP: Streaming data payment protocol for data economy,2019,"Applications in the area of IoT and smart cities rely heavily on data to manage and control their operational environments. In such applications, machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms help the government officials, city administrators, and industries to make an informed decision on managing their cities and factories using the data collected from various sources. As we step into the era where 'data is termed as new oil', there is a need for protocols with support for selling and buying data without giving up the data ownership to third-parties. In this demo, we present Streaming Data Payment Protocol (SDPP), which is an application layer protocol for selling and buying data. SDPP uses blockchain and distributed ledger technology for micropayments and immutable storage of transaction records. In addition, our protocol has a built-in mechanism to set data granularity since the bulk transfer of data between a seller and a buyer may lead to a loss for the seller if the buyer terminates the connection after receiving the data without making a payment. In this demo, we present SDPP and explain how it can contribute to the emerging data economy using a proof-of-concept implementation that uses TCP protocol for data communication and IOTA as both cryptocurrency and a distributed ledger. © 2019 IEEE.",Data Economy; Data Marketplace; IoT; SDPP

"Liu Y., Ghandar A., Theodoropoulos G.",A Metaheuristic Strategy for Feature Selection Problems: Application to Credit Risk Evaluation in Emerging Markets,2019,"As countries develop digital financial infrastructure, a wide range of economic activities expand and grow in importance: from personal loans, to the rapidly developing networked microfinance industry, to mobile telephone services and real estate transactions and so on. Personal credit is also a foundation of trust for facilitation of integrated societal transactions more generally. In emerging markets there is, however, a gap between the requirement for establishing a credit or trust rating and the lack of a credit record. The development of methodologies for greater financial integration of growing economies has the potential to have a significant impact on increasing the GDP of developing economies (4-12% according to a recent McKinsey Global Institute report). In this paper, we develop and test a methodology for feature selection and test its in standard datasets from large institutions in mature market economies, and a recent dataset which illustrates characteristics of emerging markets.

"Banzhaf H.S., Kasim M.T.",Fuel consumption and gasoline prices: The role of assortative matching between households and automobiles,2019,"Analyses of policies to reduce gasoline consumption have focused on two effects, a compositional effect on the fuel economy of the automotive fleet and a utilization effect on how much people drive. However, the literature has missed a third effect: a matching effect, in which policies change how high-utilization households are matched to fuel-efficient vehicles in equilibrium. We show that higher gas prices should lead to stronger assortative matching. Empirical estimates using US micro-level data are consistent with this hypothesis.

However, the most pressing issues in the formation and development of the valuation business in the countries are the absence of developed markets, of modern digital information infrastructure, a smoothly working operational system of statistics accumulation and as a consequence, market indicators. The goal of our research is to offer recommendations on how to harmonize valuation standards for EEU agricultural companies’ assets based on the current valuation standards taking into account international experience of developed countries and looking into the future of their further improvement. Our research into the current EEU valuation standards by criteria allowed us to assess the current standards with a large degree of certainty and reveal the negative influence factors. For better effect, we have suggested an algorithm of a unified valuation standard, which combines the best practices of the EEU states and the international professional community. The suggested concept of unified standards of asset valuation is not exhaustive, it can be augmented depending on the special features of agricultural companies. © BEIESP.",Agricultural companies; Emerging countries’ economies; IFRS; Industry standards; Standardization; Valuation activities

Jonker N.,What drives the adoption of crypto-payments by online retailers?,2019,"Using a large representative sample of retailers active in e-commerce, we find that acceptance of crypto-payments is modest (2%), but there is substantial interest among online retailers to adopt them. Regression analysis shows that consumer demand, net transactional benefits and perceived accessibility of accepting crypto-payments influence adoption intention and actual acceptance. Our findings also suggest that service providers who act as intermediaries in e-commerce play a crucial role as facilitators of competition and innovation by increasing accessibility. The most serious barrier for crypto-acceptance is a lack of consumer demand. It seems therefore unlikely that crypto adoption by online retailers will increase substantially in the near future. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Accessibility; Adoption intention; Bitcoin; Competition; Consumer demand; Costs; Crypto-payments; Cryptocurrency; Digital economy; Economic analysis; Fintech innovation; Intermediaries; Network externalities; Retailers; Two-sided markets

Krishnaprabu S.,E-governance in education sector,2019,"Education is one of the most important factors in achieving the development goals of the country. It is the key to the national development. In India Education has seen massive growth in recent years. On one hand, this growth promises to produce more skilled individuals to fulfill needs of ever growing Indian economy and on the other hand it poses a huge challenge for the governing bodies like UGC, AICTE and others to maintain or improve the quality of education. An integrated Higher Education Service System (HESS) at a national level can be one of the key Information and Communication Technology initiatives to help India become a provider of world-class education. This system can provide deep visibility to governing bodies at a university and student level to analyze their performance and hence gear up for future requirements. On the other hand E-Governance solution in the field of educational sector has changed the way administration is being done now. The solution incorporates whole data and processes of an educational Institution into a unified system, making the process uncomplicated, well organized and error proof. The solution is designed to make the system user-friendly, time saving and cost saving also. Many of them are flexible enough to adapt to the changing educational environment efficiently and quickly. E-Governance helps in improving transparency, providing speedy information, dissemination, improving administrative efficiency and public services in all the aspects of education. Educational institutions may have various requirements that include computerization and management of processes such as registration, admission, student information, classes, time table, transport, attendance, library, salary and expenses, examinations, performance, grades, hostels, security and reports. Many of the software providers allow their clients to choose from the available modules to suit their needs.

"Jasni N.S., Yusoff H., Zain M.M., Md Yusoff N., Shaffee N.S.",Business strategy for environmental social governance practices: evidence from telecommunication companies in Malaysia,2019,"Purpose: The present digital era has integrated the conventional telecommunications companies as service providers in this ever-competitive environment. Towards gaining business competitiveness, businesses are operated from the stance of dynamic business model that places focus on both economic activities and, more importantly, value-added benefits. One essential value embedded into business strategies refers to the aspect of sustainability in conjunction to environmental social governance (ESG). Within the context of Malaysia, ESG practices have been expected to grow rapidly in years to come, along with the vision of becoming a digital economy nation, by 2050. The continuous discussions appear to support the significance of implementing ESG practices amidst organizations, which in turn, could enhance a more sustainable economic growth for the country. Although many studies have probed into the dimensions of ESG, little attention has been given to the ESG practices incorporated into business strategy agenda. Design/methodology/approach: This paper combed through the literature to retrieve the multi-dimensions of ESG concepts, as well as related in-depth insights into ESG disclosures amongst leading companies established in Malaysia. As for the research design, this study used the content analysis method and the ESG Grid as the benchmarking tool to explore superior commitments amongst its peers. Findings: As a result, this study stumbled upon two major outcomes: the pattern of ESG disclosures in telecommunications industry and the approaches in implementing ESG practices in telecommunications companies. These two aspects appear essential to establish a competitive advantage, apart from addressing the issues raised by concerned stakeholders. Research limitations/implications: Future studies may explore deeper into comprehending the ESG practices by using the interview method and incorporating other industry or arena. Practical implications: The decisions made by the companies to invest in ESG practices mark the ability of a company in devising viable survival strategies within the industry. Originality/value: Hence, this study offers several vital insights into the practical value to learn from the best experiences, aside from analyzing the current progress of ESG practices within the context of developing nation. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Business strategy; Content analysis; ESG practices; Legitimacy theory; Stakeholder theory; Telecommunications
"Vahanyan G.A., Vahanyan H., Ghazaryan M.",Interactive innovative tool for early diagnosis of global pre-crisis processes (based on measurement and assessment of the virtual intellectual capital),2019,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present the great importance and impact of the virtual intellectual capital (VIC) in the frameworks of digital economics, e-governance and business, e-trading and commerce, virtual organizations and enterprises, and information communication technologies development (based on the comparative case studies of the world, Russian and Armenian economics). These conditions increase the importance of the measurement and assessment of the VIC. Design/methodology/approach: The research findings are obtained through the method of comparative analysis of the complex models of the VIC. The features are studied through measuring and assessing the VIC parameters of virtual representations on the internet. The data are complemented through virtual cluster analysis, a multidimensional statistical procedure that collects data containing information on facility selection. Three cluster groups are used in the study: the clusters of the TNCs and their virtual representations; the clusters of the network of the leading innovation centers and their virtual representations; and the clusters of the leading universities and their virtual representations. Findings: The paper establishes the research findings of the growth forecasts of the IC clusters in the world, Russian and Armenian economic processes. This is extremely important to ensuring sustainable growth of the country’s competitiveness, economy and general welfare. The paper proposes a new model of the virtual national or transnational intellectual capital (VNTIC). The VNTIC model presents three general components: virtual representations of universities, innovation center networks and transnational corporations in global networks. The research findings show that the interactive innovative tools (IIT) can be used for early diagnosis of the world economic and financial processes. Originality/value: The authors developed for the first time the IIT for measuring and assessing the three intellectual capital components. The paper presents a new approach and a more reliable tool for short-term forecasting at global and national levels based on QI ranking of the VIC clusters of the commercial enterprises, universities and networks of innovation centers. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Global economy; Global pre-crisis processes; IC clusters (world, Russian and Armenian); Innovative tool for early diagnosis; Measuring and assessing the VIC; Virtual intellectual capital"
"Žebrytė I., Fonseca-Vasquez F., Hartley R.",Emerging economy entrepreneurs and open data: Decision-making for natural disaster resilience,2019,"The aim of this study is to examine the role of Open Data in entrepreneurial decision-making in a destination threatened by natural disasters and located in an emerging economy. The region of La Araucanía, in Chile, was chosen because it constantly faces the threat of devastating natural disasters and is also the poorest region of Chile. Primary data was collected through semi-structured interviews and awareness-building workshops, with a convenience sample of 32 entrepreneurs out of 150 registered for Federation of Tourism Businesses (FEDETUR’s CET) program. The study found that local entrepreneurs are reasonably aware of the advantages and disadvantages of platforms that link supply and demand for tourism services. However, they express little interest or trust in publicly available information, and use terms like ‘internet data’ and ‘technology’ interchangeably with ‘information’ and ‘platforms’. We conclude that in order for entrepreneurs in emerging economies to strengthen their businesses’ resilience to natural disasters in the digital economy era, adjustments in their decision-making processes need to be made. Tourism-dependent places situated in emerging economies rely heavily on micro and small businesses. Greater awareness of how future economies are both ‘atom-enabled’ (landscape and other tourism resources) and ‘bit-dependent’ (digitalization of tourism) would benefit tourism entrepreneurs facing natural disaster-induced business disruptions by enabling timely and more appropriate responses. The study opens the academic debate on the role that open data could come to play in entrepreneurial decision-making within emerging economies when tourism businesses are disrupted by natural disasters. © 2019 Small Business Institute®.",Emerging economy; Entrepreneurial decision-making; Natural disasters; Open data

"Vanchukhina L., Leybert T., Rogacheva A., Rudneva Y., Khalikova E.",New model of managerial education in technical university,2019,"Purpose: A modern trend in the educational environment in recent years has been the permanent education system with the involvement of online study modes. It is based on multidisciplinarity and adaptivity of educational technologies, starting with the basic level of education – bachelor’s degree, and ending with gaining competences in the field of engineering and economics throughout the whole professional life of a student. The purpose of this paper is to perform a detailed analysis of development of permanent education in Russian universities, focusing on statistical data on popularity of jobs as to professional groups among employers and determining peculiarities of permanent education, based on the distinguished peculiarities of permanent education and requirements of business to develop a model of engineering and managerial education that would integrate two blocks of the educational process – engineering and economic, as well as include modern technologies of teaching. Design/methodology/approach: The authors propose the modern model of engineering management education that is implemented in the Russian technical universities. Its distinctive feature as compared to the conventional educational technologies is gaining competences in the field of economics and management at the same time with engineering education at the second stage of education – the master’s program. The proposed model of engineering and management education results in obtainment of two diplomas by the student who is awarded with a master’s degree in engineering and a master’s degree in economics. A difference of the offered model from the traditional educational technologies is obtaining competences in the sphere of economics and management together with engineering education at the master’s program. The result of the offered model of engineering and managerial education is graduate’s receiving two diplomas with master’s degree of engineer and master of economics. The paper shows the existing mechanism of implementing the model of engineering and economic education in a technical university by the example of the master’s program in Economics “Evaluation of economic risks during technological decisions (in oil processing and oil chemistry).” Findings: The offered model of engineering and managerial education will allow training the engineers of a new type, who will be able to adapt to new tendencies and initiate the changes that are necessary for effective functioning of business in the conditions of digital economy. Originality/value: The offered model of engineering and managerial education should be acknowledged as an innovational educational project that raises demand for graduates through their adaptability to employer’s needs and their usage of new tools of management that are based on exchange of information data and that form managerial task for information provision of the process of decision making and their further execution. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Educational technologies; Joint degrees; Managerial competences; Master’s programme; Model of engineering management education; Multidisciplinary education; Networking cooperation; Online study mode; Permanent education; Practice-oriented activity; Technical university
"Kask J., Öberg C.",Why “majors” surge in the post-disruptive recording industry,2019,"Purpose: The recording industry has gone through a far-reaching disruption, but the major record companies from the past continue to surge. The following question is addressed: Why has disruption in the recording industry not followed the patterns of generic examples from other sectors? The purpose of this paper is to describe and explain why the digital disruption does not lead to the disruption of all types of companies. Design/methodology/approach: This longitudinal study is based on a large set of secondary sources combined with in-depth interviews in Sweden’s recording industry. Findings: Findings indicate that when customers turn to streaming, the major record companies’ direct control of which music the consumer is exposed to increases. This main finding contrasts statements that streaming services would facilitate peer-to-peer sharing activities between music customers and make record companies redundant. The major record companies have remained at a prosperous position due to the control of valuable content and marketing assets, as well as asymmetric interdependency among parties in the supply chain. Research limitations/implications: The recording industry is different to many other sectors based on the latent value of catalogues, and the conclusions drawn from this paper should thereby not be taken for granted for other industries. Practical/implications: Findings suggest that by “reading” the development of the industry and understanding what key resources create dependencies and revenue flows, managers would be better at tackling disruption. Originality/value: The paper contributes to previous literature by describing how incumbent companies survive and even prosper post-disruption. It adds to the understanding of the digitalization of the recording industry and points at how dependencies help to understand disruption. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Digitalization; Disruption; Post-ownership economy; Record companies; Recording industry; Streaming services

Neeraj R.S.,Trade Rules for the Digital Economy: Charting New Waters at the WTO,2019,"This Article attempts to explore the challenges in situating a multilateral digital trade agreement within the legal framework of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Section 1 of the article discusses the broad challenges that digitization poses for the international legal framework for trade regulation. I argue first that the traditional classification of products into goods and services under the WTO system is structurally incompatible with the digital economy. I also argue that striking the appropriate balance between trade liberalization and the pursuit of legitimate public policy objectives in a digital trade agreement will be uniquely challenging because certain features that are intrinsic to the digital industry and business strategies of established players in the digital market raise serious anticompetition challenges. A multilateral agreement regulating digital trade needs to acknowledge and address these challenges. Section 2 surveys the efforts that have been undertaken to regulate digital trade as manifested in the WTO Work Program on Electronic Commerce. Acknowledging that the digital trade agenda of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement could be used as a benchmark for discussions on e-commerce at the WTO, I argue that future negotiations for a multilateral digital trade policy will not benefit from using the TPP's digital trade agenda as a benchmark. The TPP does not reconcile systemic tensions between the digital economy and the extant WTO system or address the anticompetition challenges that are unique to the digital ecosystem. © 2019 Neeraj Rs.",
"Colangelo G., Maggiolino M.",From fragile to smart consumers: Shifting paradigm for the digital era,2019,"The use of digital technologies, functioning thanks to data processing, has been conquering many sectors of the world economy and it is possible that, in the near future, only a few markets will still be excluded from this industrial revolution. Therefore, even if one chose unreasonably to disregard the many innovations that the digital economy has brought about, its development seems quite inexorable, although it is true that this new stage in human progress raises some concerns. In particular, many worry about the millions of passive and powerless digital consumers who, facing a few huge and influential companies without any education or awareness, could succumb and find themselves poorer, victimized, and manipulated. The paper proposes to react to this state of affairs without further fueling the fear of the digital revolution and without the thought that regulation can be used only as a shield to protect fragile digital consumers. Rather, by taking inspiration from some regulatory actions undertaken by the European Union, the paper bears in mind that regulation can be used as a sword in the hands of consumers to finally assign them a lead role in digital markets. New rules to empower consumers and to make them take autonomous and independent decisions as to the management of their personal data as well as to the merits of digital firms can be envisaged.

Ahmed U.,The Importance of Cross-Border Regulatory Cooperation in an Era of Digital Trade,2019,"Technology is transforming global trade. The global trading system, however, has struggled to keep up with changes in technology. One of the major challenges for the trading system is that the issues raised by digitally enabled commerce are largely regulatory in nature. The issues that are at the forefront of digital trade increasingly relate to citizens' most fundamental interactions, including speech, finance, energy, and transportation. This paper argues that resolving these international regulatory issues will require reforming the approach that has been taken to global trade negotiations. International discussions around the most challenging issues in the digital economy ought to move away from the 'horse-trading' nature of traditional trade negotiations and towards a strategy focused on regulatory cooperation. Failure to achieve regulatory cooperation could further fragment digital services based upon national borders. The Internet has the potential to positively impact the global economy precisely because it is global, decentralized, and bottom-up in nature. International policymaking through regulatory cooperation can maintain those principles, while protecting fundamental national concerns such as stability, privacy, and security. © 2019 Usman Ahmed.",

Prior research has identified the key role that IT plays in the development of tourism industry. However, IT is examined solely, while other factors that drive the development of tourism industry are neglected in these studies. Guided by the new economic growth theory, this paper integrates fixed capital, labor, and IT and further examine how they together affect the development of tourism industry. Based on the cross-sectional tourism data of 2014 in 30 provinces in China, this article runs gray correlation analysis first and then applies a Cobb-Douglas production function model. The results indicate that fixed capital, labor, and IT are all correlated with the total tourism revenue at a certain degree, and that the development of tourism industry replies more on labor and IT than on fixed capital. Labor is the factor that makes the largest contribution to the development of tourism industry.

"Patsonakis C., Roussopoulos M.",An alternative paradigm for developing and pricing storage on smart contract platforms,2019,"Smart contract platforms, the most notable of which is probably Ethereum, facilitate the development of important and diverse distributed applications (e.g., naming services and fungible tokens) in a simple manner. This simplicity stems from the inherent utility of employing the state of smart contracts to store, query and verify the validity of application data. In Ethereum, data storage incurs an underpriced, non-recurring, predefined fee. Furthermore, as there is no incentive for freeing or minimizing the state of smart contracts, Ethereum is faced with a tragedy of the commons problem with regards to its monotonically increasing state. This issue, if left unchecked, may lead to centralization and directly impact Ethereum's security and longevity. In this work, we introduce an alternative paradigm for developing smart contracts in which their state is of constant size and facilitates the verification of application data that are stored to and queried from an external, potentially unreliable, storage network. This approach is relevant for a wide range of applications, such as any key-value store. We evaluate our approach by adapting the most widely deployed standard for fungible tokens, i.e., the ERC20 token standard. We show that Ethereum's current cost model penalizes our approach, even though it minimizes the overhead to Ethereum's state and aligns well with Ethereum's future. We address Ethereum's monotonically increasing state in a two-fold manner. First, we introduce recurring fees that are proportional to the state of smart contracts and adjustable by the miners that maintain the network. Second, we propose a scheme where the cost of storage-related operations reflects the effort that miners have to expend to execute them. Lastly, we show that under such a pricing scheme that encourages economy in the state consumed by smart contracts, our ERC20 token adaptation reduces the incurred transaction fees by up to an order of magnitude. © 2019 IEEE.",Accumulator; ERC20 token; Ethereum; Smart contract

Dellaert B.G.C.,The consumer production journey: marketing to consumers as co-producers in the sharing economy,2019,"New digital technologies not only support consumers in better fulfilling their own consumption needs but also enable them to create greater value for other consumers. These new consumer co-production activities, collectively referred to as the sharing economy, require firms to rethink their role in the marketing value creation process. Firms need to define new marketing actions that create value for consumers who are also co-producers. To address this challenge, we propose a two-layered conceptual framework of consumer co-production networks and the individual consumer production journeys therein. These concepts expand the traditional production model and consumer journey, respectively, explicitly taking into account consumer co-production activities. Within the framework, we draw on household production theory combined with insights from institutional design theory and consumer behavior research to analyze how marketing can support consumers’ co-production activities.

This article investigates how practitioners engage in processes of identity work to collectively construct definitions of the domain of HRD in two Twitter chat events. HRD is presented in these events as a highly individualised practice taking place within professional networks and is characterized as an ‘enterprising self-hood’. The enterprising-self strives to demonstrate professional competence within networks that provide affiliation and relational support in the experiences of becoming and being a professional. HRD is seen to be shaped by the demands of the knowledge economy and by emerging digital technologies. This determinist stance positions technology as a challenge for the practices of HRD and as a means for HRD to develop better, more effective practices. The participants in the chat events position themselves in contrast to an ‘other’ HRD that is slow, old fashioned and failing to effectively engage with new technologies. These Twitter chat events are presented as enactments of the future practices of HRD demonstrating ‘how a professional can practise’ against descriptions of how HRD professionals currently do practice. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",personal learning; practice; Professional identity; professionalism; social media
"Domon K., Melcarne A., Ramello G.B.",Digital piracy in Asian countries,2019,"Piracy has been one of the most flamboyant topics in the legal and economic literature of the last two decades. The increased importance assigned to copyright in national economies determined the imposing of this issue as one of the leading voices in the exports of many developed countries. However, the impact of several disruptive innovations (such as the internet and all its related technologies) has weakened the original role of copyright, thus stimulating a wide scholarly literature. While the core of this stream of literature has in general considered consumers like potential infringers and tried to check the impact of piracy on sales and industry profits, a few papers have considered the behavioral perspective. This aspect becomes crucial if one wants to take consumers’ viewpoint into account, while studying the inner factors that led them to infringe copyright. Yet, behavioral law and economics literature teaches us that beside any normative claims, the individuals’ compliance to the law depends on a complex interaction of factors including risk perception, size of sanctions, psychological determinants, and cultural values which jointly determine the social norms that must be properly understood in order to make efficient laws. If a handful of papers have already tried to gain insights on consumers’ behavior in western countries, the issue is still largely neglected in many countries in the rest of the world. This paper takes advantage of a survey conducted through field research in four Asian countries, (China, Japan, Korea and Vietnam) in order to provide an innovative picture of consumers’ behavior and sketch out some more general policy implications. © 2019, Associazione Amici di Economia e Politica Industriale.",Copyright; P2P file-sharing; Unauthorized copying
"Chen L., Shaheer N., Yi J., Li S.","The international penetration of ibusiness firms: Network effects, liabilities of outsidership and country clout",2019,"The burgeoning of ibusiness firms in the modern digital economy challenges the received internationalization theory. Given that ibusinesses such as social networking sites create value by providing a digital platform for users to interact with one another, we employ a user-network perspective and externalization logic, suggesting that ibusinesses’ internationalization process depends critically on users’ collective interactions, instead of being solely driven by firms’ market commitments, as noted by the Uppsala model. However, ibusinesses may suffer from liabilities of outsidership due to the boundedness of international network effects. Drawing on social network theory, we demonstrate that such liabilities can be mitigated by first diffusing the ibusiness platform in countries with higher clout. Our analysis using a unique dataset of mobile ibusiness platforms finds empirical support for the hypotheses. We discuss theoretical implications for the network approach of the Uppsala model in the digital era. © 2018, Academy of International Business.",digital; foreign market entry; internationalization; network effect; outsidership; platform
Pulkka V.-V.,“This time may be a little different” – exploring the Finnish view on the future of work,2019,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore Finns’ labor market development predictions for the next ten years and shed light on preferred policy responses to the digital economy. Design/methodology/approach: Nationally representative survey data employed in this paper were collected in autumn 2017. The data collection utilized a multiphase sampling, and the interviews (n=1004) were carried out on telephone to minimize selection-bias and produce demographically balanced data. Findings: Over two-thirds (71 percent) of Finns do not expect technological unemployment to constitute a permanent problem in the digital economy. Nevertheless, 74 percent assume that technological unemployment will increase at least temporarily. A considerable majority (85 percent) also believe that future jobs will be more precarious. Younger generations, despite their currently weak position in the labor market, are surprisingly more optimistic in their predictions. Analysis of preferred policy responses support this paper’s main thesis that the Finnish view on the future of work is rather optimistic: education reforms and streamlining the current social security gather dedicated support, whereas more unconventional ideas such as basic income or work-sharing remain contested. Originality/value: To predict possible barriers to labor mobility stemming from digital economy discourses and to anticipate possible political fluctuations, studies on the public view are needed. This research aims to provide a solid framework for further comparative explorations of the public view. © 2018, Ville-Veikko Pulkka.",Automation; Basic income; Digital economy; Future of work; Platform economy; Technological unemployment
"Tortorella G., Miorando R., Mac Cawley A.F.",The moderating effect of Industry 4.0 on the relationship between lean supply chain management and performance improvement,2019,"Purpose: This paper aims at investigating the moderating effect of the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies on the relationship between lean supply chain management (LSCM) practices and supply chain performance improvement in the Brazilian industry. Design/methodology/approach: The authors carried out a survey over 147 Brazilian manufacturing companies to capture the improvement of four supply chain performance indicators, along with the implementation level of 17 LSCM practices and 10 digital technologies related to Industry 4.0. The data were analyzed using confirmatory and exploratory factor analysis, and ordinary least squares regression analysis. Findings: The authors’ findings indicate that the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies does moderate the relationship between LSCM practices and supply chain performance in Brazilian industry. However, this moderating effect does not occur at the same extent as expected. Originality/value: Determining the effect of the concurrent adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies with already established practices, such as LSCM ones, in manufacturing companies located in emerging countries (e.g. Brazil) provides a deeper comprehension of the benefits and challenges that the fourth industrial revolution faces to entail greater supply chain performance achievements. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Emerging economies; Industry 4.0; Lean production; Lean supply chain management; Performance
"Ansong E., Boateng R.",Surviving in the digital era – business models of digital enterprises in a developing economy,2019,"Purpose: This study aims to explore the business models and strategies of digital enterprises in a developing economy context to understand the nature of their operations, as well as their survival tactics. Design/methodology/approach: A review of literature on digital enterprise models led to the adaptation of a 16 business model archetype for analyzing digital enterprises in Ghana. Using a critical realism perspective, survey data from a sample of 91 digital enterprises were used for the study. Findings: The findings suggest that among human, physical and intangible assets, financial assets were the least used assets in the operations of the digital enterprises. This stems from the fact that the online financial business sector is still in its nascent stages in most developing economies. The findings further suggest that all digital enterprises leverage on accessible and low-cost social networking services as part of their operations and use them as an avenue to engage with their target customers. Research limitations/implications: The findings from this study provide guidelines to entrepreneurs who wish to venture into the digital ecosystem of Ghana, particularly with regard to the economic, financial and technological factors that enable digital enterprises to survive in the competitive digital economy. Practical implications: The findings suggest that it is important for governments to realize that there is an increasing rise in digital enterprises in the developing economies and these enterprises are creating jobs and providing business solutions locally that would hitherto be sought from developed economies. There is therefore the need for the requisite legal infrastructure and financial support that will cushion these enterprises from the fierce competitions that stagnate their growth. Originality/value: The study provides a mapping of the digital business models of Ghanaian digital enterprises. This knowledge is arguably the first of its kind in the context of a developing economy. Hence, it serves as a stepping-stone for future studies to explore other areas in the digital economy, especially from a developing economy perspective. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Developing economies; Digital business models; Digital business strategy; Digital economy; Digital enterprises
"Eferin Y., Hohlov Y., Rossotto C.",Digital platforms in Russia: competition between national and foreign multi-sided platforms stimulates growth and innovation,2019,"Purpose: This paper aims to test the “winner-takes-all” vs the “winner-takes-some” scenarios in digital platform competition dynamics in emerging markets. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses an analytical reference framework to assess the emergence of digital platforms in Russia, including four elements: definition of multi-sided platforms (MSPs), platform enablers, business models and competitive dynamics. Findings: This paper concludes that Russia shows that a healthy competition between national and foreign MSPs led to the emergence of a shared equilibrium, where local platforms were able to retain a significant, often majority, share vis-à-vis foreign and global platforms. Research limitations/implications: This paper stands as a counterpoint to the widespread conviction that digital platform dynamics will result into a “winner-takes-all” scenario and dominance of global platforms. Practical implications: This case study offers practical data and analysis that can be used to create a baseline and evaluate the dynamics of digital platforms in emerging markets. It offers data, trends and evidence on Russia’s digital economy. Social implications: This research provides a logical framework to help policymakers take decisions on a policy framework to regulate platforms in emerging markets. The good outcome of competition between local and foreign platforms should emerge as a policy objective to achieve in most emerging markets. Originality/value: This case study is the first baseline to assess the dynamics of competition between national and foreign digital platforms in the Russian market. It is one of the first papers to tackle the market of digital platforms in an emerging and developing economy. It tries to address the debate between “winner-takes-all” and “winner-takes some” competition equilibrium through a concrete case study in an important G20 emerging market economy. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Competitive strategy; Digital business; Digital economy; Digital platforms; Multi-sided platforms; Russian economy
"Mustafa S.Z., Kar A.K.",Prioritization of multi-dimensional risk for digital services using the generalized analytic network process,2019,"Purpose: In current times, organizations operating in emerging economies are providing digital services to its citizen the internet. Literature indicates that digital services are facing major challenges with respect to its adoption among users groups due to the perceived risks. Design/methodology/approach: With the use of generalized analytic network process (GANP), prioritization of different dimensions of risk has been done on the basis of an empirical survey among user groups in India. Findings: The result indicates that dimensions like privacy risk, performance risk and financial risk are more important risks across digital services models. However, physical risk, social risk, psychological risk and time risk are comparatively less important risks across digital services. This research also finds out that the end users are reluctant to provide their personal information. Research limitations/implications: The sample size is relatively small which limits generalizability of results beyond India. However, an application of GANP has been showcased for empirical research. Practical implications: The research outcome can help managers in deciding which dimensions of risk are more important for digital service delivery and thus facilitate adoption. Originality/value: This paper focused on the different facets of risk perceived by consumers, toward the digital services available in smart cities. Perceived risk dimensions such as privacy risk, performance risk, financial risk, physical risk, social risk, psychological risk and time risk have shown that there is a need to prioritize these risks to the digital services which is offered to the residents of the smart cities. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Analytic network process; Digital services; Emerging economies; Information risk; Perceived risk; Smart cities
"Wentrup R., Nakamura H.R., Ström P.",Uberization in Paris – the issue of trust between a digital platform and digital workers,2019,"Purpose: Using the lens of Uber’s digital workers in Paris, the purpose of this paper is to investigate how the trust-building mechanism is constructed between a digital platform and its digital workers in a foreign market entry. Design/methodology/approach: This is a case study based on empirical data from in-depth interviews with 35 Uber drivers. A cross-disciplinary literature framework from mainly international business and internet geography theory and a reflexive qualitative methodology are applied. Findings: Results show that the relationship between the digital platform and the digital workers is characterized by mistrust and suffers from decreasing commitment levels soon after market entry. Uber mitigates its mistrust via control and scarce mechanisms. The digital drivers’ “illusionary freedom”, a state in which they feel they can log on and log off at any time, enables the digital platform to gradually lower its commitment. The authors find that the mistrust does not seem to hamper the digital platform’s business performance. Research limitations/implications: The paper mainly covers the digital workers’ perspective and the case of Uber’s market entry in Paris. Social implications: This paper implies that digitally conveyed control seems to come at the cost of lowered human trust. Given the pace at which digital control systems are permeating society, this could eventually lower the whole societal trust level. Originality/value: The authors criticize incumbent international business theory for not being sufficiently able to explain a contemporary digital business logic and the authors challenge the general assumption that successful internationalization is built through trust. The authors contribute with the conceptualization of a new technical market entry mode for digital platforms – “digitally controlled proxies”. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Digital platforms; Digital work; International business; Sharing economy; Trust; Uber

Clarke R.,Risks inherent in the digital surveillance economy: A research agenda,2019,"The digitisation of data about the world relevant to business has given rise to a new phase of digitalisation of business itself. The digitisation of data about people has linked with the notions of information society, surveillance society, surveillance state and surveillance capitalism, and given rise to what is referred to in this article as the digital surveillance economy. At the heart of this is a new form of business model that is predicated on the acquisition and consolidation of very large volumes of personal data, and its exploitation to target advertisements, manipulate consumer behaviour, and price goods and services at the highest level that each individual is willing to bear. In the words of the model’s architects, users are ‘bribed’ and ‘induced’ to make their data available at minimal cost to marketers. The digital surveillance economy harbours serious threats to the interests of individuals, societies and polities. That in turn creates risks for corporations. The new economic wave may prove to be a tsunami that swamps the social dimension and washes away the last five centuries’ individualism and humanism. Alternatively, institutional adaptation might occur, overcoming the worst of the negative impacts; or a breaking-point could be reached and consumers might rebel against corporate domination. A research agenda is proposed, to provide a framework within which alternative scenarios can be investigated. © The Author(s), 2018.",Digitalisation; Internet business model; surveillance capitalism; Web 2.0

To explore this, the present paper presents a frame analysis of news content on ridesharing platforms in Indonesia and the Philippines. We identify five distinct frames, perceiving ridesharing as a (1) commuter solution, (2) unregulated public transport service, (3) cooperative business, (4) non-conformity solution, and (5) informal livelihoods. We show how these frames emerge from a particular developing-economy context characterized by gridlock problems in densely populated cities, the utilization of “informal transport” as a gap-filler, and an emphasis on collectiveness. The paper furthermore argues that the identified frames shape different policy responses to ridesharing in Indonesia and the Philippines, which 1) address the absence of legal status; 2) ease traffic congestion. The paper concludes that these responses are driven primarily by commercial and legal concerns rather than sustainability concerns. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Developing economies; Digital platform; Informal transport; Ridesharing; Sharing economy

It can contribute to the national awareness, local economy or even add international recognition. The old typography from the 19th century used by the prominent Slovenian printer Jožef Blaznik was analysed. It was digitised with some optimisations for contemporary use. Moreover, its usability was tested, since this typeface had an important contribution to the use and preservation of the Slovenian language by means of advanced printing technology and high quality of the work. In order to study the differences among various typefaces, the digitised typeface was compared with the other two widely used in printed publications. The influence of type size, substrate and digital printing (NIP) technology on legibility and preserved information was compared by analysing chemical, physical and colorimetric properties of the paper and prints, along with the typographic properties and legibility testing, using standard methods and the unconventional non-invasive testing methods, e.g. image analysis. The results show that the digitisation of old typography from the 19th century was an appropriate method, and that it is necessary to consider the chosen typeface and its size to ensure information permanence and legibility of a text. The selected (Blaznic) typeface could be used in printed publications, still ensuring satisfied legibility. Furthermore, information permanence was satisfactory even when this typeface was used in small type sizes. Therefore, the Blaznic typeface could be recommended even today for the use in different graphic design solutions. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS",Cultural heritage; Image analysis; Legibility; Lightfastness; NIP technologies; Typography

"Briglauer W., Dürr N.S., Falck O., Hüschelrath K.",Does state aid for broadband deployment in rural areas close the digital and economic divide?,2019,"We evaluate the impact of a major European state aid programme for speed upgrades in broadband internet availability applied to rural areas in the German state of Bavaria throughout 2010 and 2011. We use a matched difference-in-differences estimation strategy that compares treated and untreated municipalities that are balanced with respect to funding criteria. We find that aided municipalities have a significantly higher broadband coverage at higher speed than non-aided municipalities. This increase in broadband coverage does not, on average, benefit the local population in terms of increase in local jobs per resident or wages. However, these effects are heterogeneous across skill groups. Furthermore, we find positive effects on the employment rate among residents. Taking these results together suggests that an increase in broadband coverage through state aid protects rural areas from depopulation (while residents work at other locations), but does not contribute to a further closing of the economic divide in the form of creating new jobs. © 2019",Bavaria; Broadband; Employment; European union; Ex-post evaluation; Germany; Government policy; Rural areas; State aid

Platforms are typically digital markets, although platforms can designate markets generally. So, the economics of markets and the economics of platforms are one and the same. Platforms show the critical role of intermediaries in endogenous price adjustment and market clearing. The platform model remedies problems with general equilibrium analysis by combining and extending the basic Walrasian and Marshalian market models. The analysis of platforms provides explanations for the bid–ask spread, including market power, search costs, matching costs, adverse selection, and moral hazard. The study of platforms demonstrates the importance of participation and coordination in the formation of markets. The discussion emphasizes that platforms have significant implications for the theory of the firm.

The main purpose of the event was creating awareness about the future prospects of Smart Cities. The event served as a platform to exchange ideas, prototypes and systems in an international setting. The event's objectives were also to emphasize the role of the University of Bahrain in promoting a smarter kingdom via its consultancy, intellectual forums, publications and innovative solutions. In addition, the event also focused on networking opportunities for research and development related to smart cities. The symposium offered an excellent opportunity for scientists, innovators, and engineers to interact, share experiences and present their latest research with peers in a multidisciplinary engineering background. The symposium venue was at University of Bahrain, and was run for two days, (22- 23 April 2018). The symposium involved both invited speakers (talking about the need for and benefits of smart cities), in addition to academic peer-reviewed papers published by the IET digital library, IEEE Xplore digital library, and indexed by SCOPUS. This special issue of the International Journal of Computing and Digital Systems (IJCDS), focuses on smart systems research and technologies, and publishes selected papers from the Smart Cities Symposium, whose main theme was “Solutions for a Smarter Economy” (22- 23 April 2018, Manama, Bahrain). The symposium had eight different tracks that cover important aspects related to electrical, computer and electronics engineering. Three members of the technical program review committee reviewed each paper, and the accepted papers were presented during the symposium, only four papers were accepted as extended versions in this special issue. The papers included here offer in-depth discussion and informal exchange of ideas, concepts, and experiences in a wide range of topics related to smart cities, Engineering, IT, AI and other related solutions for future smart cities. © 2019 International Journal of Computing and Digital Systems.All right reserved.",Assessment; Performance Evaluation; Smart Systems; Technologies
"Bailey M., Chatzakis E., Spencer N., Adey K.L., Sterling N., Smith N.",A design-led approach to transforming wicked problems into design situations and opportunities,2019,"This article argues that using a design-led approach is highly beneficial when tackling complex problems to transform ambiguity into actionable design briefs and solution opportunities. This is evidenced by way of an ongoing project with a large public-sector organization. Northumbria University’s School of Design academic experts use design-led approaches to innovation that promotes ‘crea-tive fusion’ between diverse stakeholders in order to tackle ‘wicked problems’. The authors continue this work as part of an Arts and Humanities Research Council/ European Regional Development Fund-funded programme entitled Creative Fuse North East (CFNE), involving five regional universities, of which the project discussed here is a part. The main objectives of CFNE are to develop and deploy approaches to innovation that apply skills from creative graduates to benefit the wider creative economy, address barriers to innovation and promote growth and sustainability within and without the Creative, Digital and IT sector (CDIT). The authors propose that to do this it is vital to convert stakeholders into co-creation activists empowered with the creative confidence and tools required to speculate about uncertain futures. © 2019 Intellect Ltd Article.",Co-creation; Creative confidence; Design catalysts; Frames; Innovation; Multidisciplinary
Chaganti R.,GE and alphabet: A tale of two conglomerates,2019,"GE, an American icon, is a falling giant, and Alphabet, of Silicon Valley, is a rising one. In this paper, we review writings on the organizational structure of conglomerates and the facts in the two cases, analyze the fall of GE, and the rise of Alphabet. Though GE is a conglomerate, its executives did not recognize it as such and attempted for decades to “integrate” its unrelated businesses. Its strategy for Internet-of-things and digital transformation of GE faced many internal obstacles, ran in to execution problems, and was not a growth priority. Alphabet played according what theory would suggest: keep the conglomerate structure simple, allocate resources efficiently, and act transparently. In contrast to GE, Alphabet networked some of its businesses and benefited from the networking economies. Though solutions are rampant in the press and elsewhere, this paper looks at how to apply the theory on conglomerates to inform the options for GE. There is a lot GE and Larry Culp can take away from Alphabet and Larry Page. © 2019, Rutgers Business School. All rights reserved.",

Therefore, it needs to be connected to the grid to reduce the demand from the authority, which means the flow of the load will be reduced. The production of the electricity as a solar energy will increase in the locations where the sun intensity is concentrated. The good location for solar energy is the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries.

"Vani M., Rama Mohan Y.",Eplq: Efficient privacy-preserving location-based query over outsourced encrypted data,2019,"With the unavoidability of PDAs, location-based services (LBS) have received great attention and turn out increasingly dominant and indispensable delayed. In any case, the use of LBS also poses a potential threat to the security of the customer area. In this paper, which refers to a request for spatial classification, the standard LBS system, which provides information on the individual POIs (Points of Interest), we offer a game plan based on the creation range and the protected area security called EPLQ. Location-based Service (LBS) has recently had an impact on the rapid improvement of mobile phones, as well as the bottom-up perspective of distributed processing. Closed due to LBS development issues, and customer insurance is becoming a significant issue. Therefore, productive LBS economies must be safe and deliver accurate results. To guarantee the protection of the request for spatial range request, we propose in particular the main encryption structure of the main internal extension base, which can be used to find out whether the position is in a specific circular zone in the form of security. To minimize inactivity, we organize the EPLQ Security Tree structure. Point security checks confirm EPLQ security features. The in-depth tests are carried out in the same way, and the results show that EPLQ is extremely productive for the protection of spatial activity, for which coded information on allocation is required. Especially for a small LBS client using an Android phone, the question arises for 0.9 seconds. That's why a product workstation is necessary, and our cloud activity will take two to three minutes to understand POIs in our investigations. © BEIESP.",Location-based service (LBS); Personal digital assistant (PDAs); Point of interest (POI)

"Messmann L., Boldoczki S., Thorenz A., Tuma A.",Potentials of preparation for reuse: A case study at collection points in the German state of Bavaria,2019,"This research addresses the second priority of the waste management hierarchy and the demand for a circular economy. First, we develop a methodology for the quantitative assessment of potentially reusable wastes. Second, based on empirically retrieved primary data following the developed methodology, this study quantifies a theoretical potential for the preparation for reuse of Waste Electric and Electronic Equipment (WEEE), used furniture, and used leisure goods in the German state of Bavaria. We find that between 13% and 16% of these waste streams could immediately be prepared for reuse, depending on the type of waste. A further potential of 13%–29% could be unlocked through changes to the mode of collection, storage and the overall treatment of wastes at Bavaria collection points. Most notably, 86% of identifiable damage causes of WEEE are attributed to a lack of sufficient weatherproof roofing. Conclusively, we derive four key action recommendation for unlocking existing potentials. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Circular economy; Preparation for reuse; Reuse potential; Transfer station; Waste management
"De Cian E., Sue Wing I.",Global Energy Consumption in a Warming Climate,2019,"We combine econometric analysis of the response of energy demand to temperature and humidity exposure with future scenarios of climate change and socioeconomic development to quantify the impacts of future climate warming on final energy consumption across the world. Globally, changes in climate circa 2050 have a moderate impact on energy consumption of 7–17%, depending on the degree of warming. Impacts vary in sign and magnitude across regions, fuels, and sectors. Climatically-induced changes in energy use are larger in tropical regions. Almost all continents experience increases in energy demand, driven by the commercial and industrial sectors. In Europe declines in energy use by residences drive an overall reduction in aggregate final energy. Energy use increases in almost all G20 economies located in the tropics, while outside of Europe G20 countries in temperate regions experience both increasing and declining total energy use, depending on the incidence of changes in the frequency of hot and cold days. The effect of climate change is regressive, with the incidence of increased energy demand overwhelmingly falling on low- and middle-income countries, raising the question whether climate change could exacerbate energy poverty. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.",Adaptation; Climate change; Energy; Panel data
"Watanabe C., Naveed N., Neittaanmäki P.",Digitalized bioeconomy: Planned obsolescence-driven circular economy enabled by Co-Evolutionary coupling,2019,"Driven by digital solutions, the bioeconomy is taking major steps forward in recent years toward achievement of the long-lasting goal of transition from a traditional fossil economy to a bioeconomy-based circular economy. The coupling of digitalization and bioeconomy is leading towards a digitalized bioeconomy that can satisfy the shift in consumers’ preferences for eco-consciousness, which in turn induces coupling of up-down stream operation in the value chain. Thus, the co-evolution of the coupling of digitalization and bioeconomy and of upstream and downstream operations is transforming the forest-based bioeconomy into a digital platform industry. Aiming at addressing this transformation, a model was developed that explains above mentioned dynamism and demonstrated its reliability through an empirical analysis focusing on the development trajectory of UPM (forest-based ecosystem leader in Europe and a world pioneer in the circular economy) over the last quarter century, highlighting its efforts towards planned obsolescence-driven circular economy. It was comprehended that with the advancement of digital innovations, UPM has incorporated a self-propagating function that accelerates digital solution. Furthermore, this self-propagating function was triggered by coupling with a downstream leader, Amazon, in the United States. The dynamism in transforming a forest-based bioeconomy into a digital platform industry is thus clarified, and new insights common to all industries in the digital economy are provided. © 2018",Circular economy; Digital-bio coupling; Digitalized bioeconomy; Planned obsolescence; Upstream-downstream coupling

Flanagan F.,Theorising the gig economy and home-based service work,2019,"The history of domestic servants in Australia offers a provocative challenge to the prophets of the digital gig economy. Like home-based service workers today, 19th-and 20th-century domestic servants worked without the protection of minimum wages or hours, unions or independent arbitration and endured perpetually porous boundaries between their work and non-working time, low status and pay. This article argues that digital platforms are instruments of a fundamental shift in the governance of home-based service work, from a system of ‘dyadic’ to one of ‘structural’ domination. Intermediaries played virtually no role in the operation of the former system, but they play a fundamental role in the latter, as aggregators of data about workers’ responsiveness and speed that enable market-based disciplinary mechanisms to operate without reference to public law and across a much larger spatial context than was previously possible. Short-termism and the fungibility of workers are pre-eminent features of the gig economy model, processes which are inherently corrosive to quality caring relationships that demand an atmosphere of trust and non-instrumentality. The historical analysis that is advanced gives rise to a number of implications for the regulation of digital platforms, union responses and industry planning in the future. © 2018, Australian Labour and Employment Relations Association (ALERA), SAGE Publications Ltd, Los Angeles, London, New Delhi, Singapore and Washington DC.",Care work; domestic servants; economy; gender gig; informal labour

Such work consists of the remote provision of a wide variety of digital services mediated by online labour platforms. Focusing on workers in Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, the article draws on semi-structured interviews in six countries (N = 107) and a cross-regional survey (N = 679) to detail the manner in which remote gig work is shaped by platform-based algorithmic control. Despite varying country contexts and types of work, we show that algorithmic control is central to the operation of online labour platforms. Algorithmic management techniques tend to offer workers high levels of flexibility, autonomy, task variety and complexity. However, these mechanisms of control can also result in low pay, social isolation, working unsocial and irregular hours, overwork, sleep deprivation and exhaustion. © The Author(s) 2018.",Flexibility; gig economy; job quality; labour process; platform economy; workplace control
"Yu T., Shen W.",Funds sharing regulation in the context of the sharing economy: Understanding the logic of China's P2P lending regulation,2019,"“Sharing economy” is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide range of digital platform-based activities that includes P2P lending and other forms of internet-based lending. The core aim of the sharing economy is to leverage the utilization of idle capacity. P2P lending can not only be used to leverage small amounts of money on the lender's side, but also be used to promote financial democracy and inclusion both on the lender and borrower's sides. P2P lending regulation, therefore, should place an emphasis on the utilization of dead money and promotion of financial democracy. This article scrutinizes the regulation of P2P lending in China. The existing regulatory system for P2P lending in China is built upon rules and regulations that have been designed solely with traditional brokers in mind. The article contends that the rigid rules placed on lending platforms limited their ability to maintain their roles as brokers and, in turn, heavily endangered the commercial sustainability of P2P platforms, thereby harming the sharing economy's openness and inclusivity. Additionally, the article argues that the fact that there is no limit on the amount a lender can invest poses a threat to the notions of leveraging idle money and financial inclusivity. The closed-ended P2P lending regime in China would cause some chilling effects to financial innovation in the P2P lending industry, and in a wider sense, the rising FinTech sector. Regulators in China need to cope with these challenges in a flexible but pragmatic manner, and particularly make use of the benefits the sharing economy may bring to the Chinese economy more broadly. © 2018 Tao Yu and Wei Shen",Financial democracy; Financial regulation; P2P lending; Sharing economy
"Martín-Gómez A., Aguayo-González F., Luque A.",A holonic framework for managing the sustainable supply chain in emerging economies with smart connected metabolism,2019,"Since their origins, human societies have integrated into the natural environment, where social metabolism that identified the interactions between society and nature was established. This social metabolism enables the flows of energy and materials between social and natural environments to be analyzed and quantified. However, in the last century, many societies have undergone a transformation from an agricultural to an industrial system. Thus, labour, as a generator of economic capital through the supply chain, has provoked a loss of natural and social capital, especially in emerging economies, thereby generating the metabolic rift. This situation can be mitigated and reversed through a circular economy, the use of digital and technological enablers of Industry 4.0 and the incorporation of an organizational enabler such as the holonic paradigm. The integration of these enablers has given rise to the development of the cyber-physical holon, which incorporates inherently sustainable concepts and allows the analysis of distributed complex systems. This paper proposes a holonic framework for multiscale and multilevel Adaptive and Integrated Sustainable Supply Chain Management (AISSCM). This framework supports a smart connected social metabolism integrated within the natural environment and oriented towards mitigation and reversal of the metabolic rift, through the processes of adaptation and integration to enable the co-evolution of the supply chain within the environment. The framework developed is applied to a family of products through their sustainable supply chain based on circularity. This proposal is developed to enable the necessary transition towards sustainable societies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Circular economy; Ecological network analysis; Holonic systems; Industry 4.0; Social metabolism; Sustainable supply chain

"Ustyuzhina O., Mikhaylova A., Abdimomynova A.",Entrepreneurial competencies in higher education,2019,"Entrepreneurship education has a great success in education field. During the last decades, it became widely spread in the USA, Asian and European countries. As a result, the number of various pedagogic approaches and courses that are devoted to the field-specific themes within entrepreneurial activity, drastically increased. Nevertheless, the majority of the existing programs and techniques in different countries (including Russian Federation) have some deficiencies in their theoretical and practical parts that influence the students’ attitude towards entrepreneurial activity. That is why, they need to be corrected. Guided by this purpose, the authors conducted a survey to identify the students’ attitude towards entrepreneurial activity and the level of their readiness to participate in it. Besides, the purpose of the research was to reveal the deficiencies of educational programs that can result in the students’ lack of readiness for entrepreneurial activity. The research is oriented towards the audience that is more universal in its composition. This will allow to reveal general problem that characterizes the domestic education. That is why, the research was conducted in different universities of four Russian cities. The survey was focused upon three aspects: the students’ attitude towards entrepreneurship, the factors of their business-development and the students’ evaluation of the practical and theoretical content of education programs in universities. 710 four-year students took part in the survey. The results of the research pointed to the students’ general lack of readiness for entrepreneurial activity. Besides, the research allowed to identify a low effectiveness level of education programs as the reason of this situation. It is conditioned by a small number of field-specific disciplines, by the absence of the programs and probations, by the lack of techniques that develop entrepreneurial spirit. These results will allow the administration of higher education institutions to revise all the critical remarks that were formulated by the students, to introduce the lacking techniques, to correct the content of the education program in order to exclude the disciplines that do not directly relate to the students’ specialization and to address the problem of the advanced training of the faculty staff in order to increase the quality of the education process. © 2019, Allied Business Academies.

"Mueller M., Grindal K.",Data flows and the digital economy: information as a mobile factor of production,2019,"Purpose: This paper aims to analyze the direction and balance of transnational information flows and look at how nonpriced digital information exchanges related to international trade in goods and services. Design/methodology/approach: The authors obtained quantitative data about Web-related data flows between countries and regions using Telegeography data on “Server Location as a Percentage of Top Websites.” They then explore how those flows are correlated to trade in goods. Findings: Web traffic is highly transnational. More than half of the top 100 websites in 9 of the world’s 13 sub-regions are hosted in the USA. More than 15 per cent of the top 100 websites in 9 of the 13 subregions are hosted in Western Europe. East Asia has the largest negative balance in the relationship between incoming and outgoing Web requests. The authors found a very strong negative correlation (−0.878) between Web traffic balances and the balance of trade in goods across all subregions. A similarly strong positive correlation was found with services trade; however, the incompleteness of the data does not allow for strong conclusions yet. Research limitations/implications: Further research is needed to correlate Web traffic flows with capital flows. The authors also do not have a well-developed theory to explain the strong negative correlation between information flows and goods trade. Practical implications: The data and analysis have useful implications for digital economy policy. It indicates that digital protectionism of the sort practice by China may succeed in increasing domestic producers’ share of Web requests, but does not make them globally competitive. The strong negative correlation between the balance of unpriced Web information and the balance of trade in goods indicates interdependence rather than domination, challenging narratives that information flow imbalances are caused by market power of the big platforms. Social implications: The paper demonstrates the degree to which unpriced digital exchanges are transnational and how various countries are more or less globally competitive in the supply of information that the rest of the world finds attractive. Originality/value: No other published papers have used the data on website traffic data, and previous research has not explored empirically the correlation between information flows and goods trade. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Information society; International trade; Internet
Aguerre C.,Digital trade in Latin America: mapping issues and approaches,2019,"Purpose: In Latin America, digital trade is still a marginal issue in the internet policy and governance debate, as well as in the trade regime. However, there are signs that this is beginning to change. This paper aims to discuss why this is changing and how, against the backdrop of the internet governance field. Design/methodology/approach: The research has used a mixed methods approach based on interviews and participant observation in one regional process, as well as an extensive literature review and document analysis. Findings: There is a current scenario for expanding the digital trade agenda in the regional commercial blocs with the aim of rapidly incorporating them to a process of digitization that will be challenging their economic foundations. The tangibility of the impact of the expanding digital economy is much more prevalent than other internet governance debates, and these initiatives seem to be adopting a pragmatic approach, rather than questioning the existing rules that govern the trade and the internet regimes. There are significant challenges emerging from a fragmented institutional background for trade-related policy in the region and the digital single market might be one of the solutions. Finally, domestic coordination among competing laws regarding data protection and their enforcement without conflicting with cross border data flows will be a challenge to be addressed. Originality/value: There is a lack of evidence-based research on the subject in the region. Many of the accounts stem from normative perspectives (many from scholars with legal backgrounds).

"Bendiek A., Römer M.",Externalizing Europe: the global effects of European data protection,2019,"Purpose: This paper aims to explain how the EU projects its own data protection regime to third states and the US in particular. Digital services have become a central element in the transatlantic economy. A substantial part of that trade is associated with the transfer of data, most of it personal, requiring many of the new products and services emerging to adhere to data protection standards. Yet different conceptions of data protection exist across the Atlantic, with the EU putting a particular focus on protecting the fundamental right to privacy. Design/methodology/approach: Using the distinction between positive and negative forms of market integration as a starting point (Scharpf, 1997), this paper examines the question of how the EU is projecting its own data protection regime to third states. The so-called California effect (Vogel, 1997) and the utilization of trade agreements in the EU’s foreign policy and external relations are well researched. With decreasing effectiveness and limited territorial reach of its enlargement policy, the EU found trade agreements to be particularly effective to set standards on a global level (Lavenex and Schimmelfennig, 2009). The existence of the single market makes the Union not only an important locus of regulation but also a strong economic actor with the global ambition of digital assertiveness. In the past, establishing standards for the EU’s vast consumer market has proven effective in compelling non-European market participants to join. Findings: As the globe’s largest consumer market, Europe aims to project its own data protection laws through the market place principle (lex loci solutionis), requiring any data processor to follow its laws whenever European customers’ data are processed. This paper argues that European data protection law creates a “California Effect”, whereby the EU exerts pressure on extra-territorial markets by unilateral standard setting. Originality/value: With its GDPR, the EU may have defused the problem of European citizens’ data being stored and evaluated according to the US law. However, it has also set a precedent of extra-territorial applicability of its legislation – despite having previously criticized the USA for such practices. By now, international companies increasingly store data of European customers in Europe to prevent conflicts with EU law. With this decision, the EU will apply its own law on others’ sovereign territory. Conflicts created through the extra-territorial effects of national law may contradict the principle of due diligence obligations but are nevertheless not illegitimate. They may, however, have further unintended effects: Other major economies are likely to be less reluctant in the future about passing legal provisions with extra-territorial effect. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",California effect; Data protection; Digital trade; Fundamental rights; Privacy

As a model, the sharing economy has been expected to make significant contributions to sustainability, providing new opportunities for entrepreneurship, more sustainable use of resources, and consumer co-operation in tight economic networks.

Focused on accommodation, this paper conceptualizes the sharing economy in comparison to the wider collaborative economy, and discusses its social, economic, environmental, and political impacts in comparison to the sustainable development goals. It concludes that the sharing economy has great potential to make very significant contributions to sustainability, though the model is increasingly being replaced by the collaborative economy, which performs as an extension and acceleration of neoliberal economic practices. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Qian Y.,Central Bank Digital Currency: optimization of the currency system and its issuance design,2019,"Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) contributes to optimizing payment functions of fiat money, reducing reliance on payment services provided by the private sector, alleviating regulatory burdens and pressure on the central bank, and strengthening the authority of fiat money. Moreover, issuance of CBDC helps to address dilemmas of modern monetary policies, including inefficiencies in policy transmission, difficulties in countercyclical control, flow of currency away from the real economy to the virtual economy and inadequate management of policy expectations. This paper proposes a CBDC issuance framework based on forward contingencies. The incorporation of time, sector, and loan rate contingencies in the activation of CBDC will realize real-time transmission of monetary policy, enable targeted supply of money and prevent the currency from circulating beyond the real economy. The economic state contingency makes it possible to exercise countercyclical control of currency. The embedment of these contingencies also enables currency to perform the function of forward guidance. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Central Bank Digital Currency; forward guidance; monetary policy
Andrew D.,Programmatic trading: the future of audience economics,2019,"Communication researchers examining how audiences are commoditised in the audience marketplace by commercial media providers and advertisers have been using audience economic models that were applied to commercial television, radio and print audiences. New digital technologies are transforming the way audiences are commoditised and previous models of the audience marketplace are not applicable to the new audience marketplace. This paper examines how audience economy and audience marketplace theories evolved and describes how programmatic advertising—the automated trading of the audience commodity—differs from previous audience theories requiring a need to re-examine these theories. New digital technology is being used to not only find audiences online but also uses data to create profiles of individuals audience members. The datafied audience plays a central role in the programmatic trading of the evolving audience commodity and the new audience marketplace that has emerged. © 2019, © 2019 Australian and New Zealand Communication Association.",Advertising; audience economics; audience measurement; programmatic
"Budzinski O., Stöhr A.",Competition policy reform in europe and germany – institutional change in the light of digitization,2019,"The ubiquitous process of digitization changes economic competition on markets in several ways and leads to the emergence of new business models. The increasing roles of digital platforms as well as data-driven markets represent two relevant examples. These developments challenge competition policy, which must consider the special economic characteristics of digital goods and markets. In Germany, national competition law was amended in 2017 in order to accommodate for digitization-driven changes in the economy and plans for further changes are already discussed. We review this institutional change from an economics perspective and argue that most of the reform’s elementspoint into the right direction. However, some upcoming challenges may have been overlooked so far. Furthermore, we discuss whether European competition policy should follow the paragon of the German reform and amend its institutional framework accordingly. We find scope for reform particularly regarding data-driven markets, whereas platform economics appear to be already well-established. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Algorithms; Antitrust; Big data; Competition policy; Consumer protection; Digitization; Industrial economics; Industrial organization; Institutional economics; Internet economics; Media economics; Personalized data; Platform economics; Privacy; Two-sided markets
"Langley P., Anderson B., Ash J., Gordon R.",Indebted life and money culture: payday lending in the United Kingdom,2019,"Critical social scientific research holds that credit–debt is a principal economic and governing relation in contemporary economy and society, but largely neglects money’s role in indebted life. Drawing on qualitative research in the payday loan market in the United Kingdom, the paper shows that borrowers typically relate to loans in monetary rather than financial terms and incorporate them into practices of payment, spending and online banking. To analyse how indebted life is variously experienced and enacted through money, the concept of money culture is developed to refer to money’s culture, money’s meanings and money’s affects. Borrowers enter into and negotiate payday loans through a digitally mediated money culture that both mobilizes and runs counter to money’s powerful fictions as circulating universal equivalent and calculative means of account. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",debt; digital mediation; money; online banking; payday lending
Keogh B.,From aggressively formalised to intensely in/formalised: accounting for a wider range of videogame development practices,2019,"Beyond the dominant North American and Japanese console manufacturers and multinational publishers, the global videogame industry is fragmenting. New audiences, distribution platforms, and development tools are expanding the videogame industry into an ecosystem that is at once broadly global and intensely localised. Taking advantage of this nebulous environment are increasingly visible fringes of hobbyists, amateurs, students, and artists that are pushing videogame development in new directions in terms of aesthetics, design process, and distribution channels. The activities of these fringe creators represent a critical but undertheorised aspect of the videogame industry. This article builds on Lobato and Thomas’s notion of ‘informal media economies’ to suggest that the work of these fringes can be usefully considered as informal videogame development practices. It provides a historical look at the videogame industry that demonstrates how it transitioned from a period of aggressive formalisation through the 1980s to the early 2000s into a more intense intermingling of formal and informal actors and processes in the early 2010s. In doing so, this article traces the shifting conduits of creative practice, commerce, and power that these emerging informal practices represent so as to more fully account for the contemporary global videogame industry. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",amateur; creative practice; digital media; game development; game industry; indie; informal; Videogames

"Degtereva V.A., Ivanov M.V., Barabanov A.A.",Issues of building a digital economy in modern Russia,2019,"In the second half of the last century, the formation of the information society began in the context of the unprecedented development of science and technology. An important feature of the information society is the existence of a digital economy, which should be considered a new stage of development of the global economic system, and which involves the transformation of all spheres of human activity under the influence of information technology. The rapid development and spread of the Internet, as well as other innovative technologies, indicates a steady increase in their impact on the world economy. No sphere of public life can avoid being involved in global digitalization. This process affects not only scientific and technical sectors, but also socio-economic ones, which is crucial in the context of developing long-term strategic prospects for the development of society. The role of the economy sectors related to information and telecommunication technologies in the formation of national income is steadily increasing. One of the key tasks of digitalization is the coordination of production processes, the creation of unified information systems. Currently, innovative systems are being actively implemented in industry, medicine, space industry, neurotechnology development, and robotics. The need to carry out economic activities with the help of digital technologies is beyond doubt. Nevertheless, in the scientific community the question of what the digital economy should be has not been finally answered. The problem of the formation and development of a digital economy in Russia is relevant not only in theoretical but also in practical terms. The development of economic relations in post-Soviet Russia was accompanied by a number of problems, the solution of which initially required active participation of the state. The forced transition to a market economy and the complex process of privatization has defined the need to identify a set of economic problems, the solution of which requires an analysis of the specifics of the development of the state and society in our country. To achieve success in building a digital economy, public awareness of the key role of digital technologies in achieving stability and well-being plays a crucial role. In the context of research on building a digital economy in Russia, it is necessary to identify promising areas for its development. In order to increase international competitiveness and achieve a fundamentally new level and quality of life for citizens, building a digital economy in Russia is an important strategic perspective. This article aims to clarify basic problems of building a digital economy in Russia in order to enhance research interest in this problem. © Proceedings of the 14th European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, ECIE 2019.

The authors have proposed the principle of limited action of social innovation institutions, which demonstrates the features of the institutional governance of social innovations with different levels of budgets in the digital economy. In order to achieve the aim of our research, it has been developed special institutional development aspects for small, medium and large budget social innovations, combined with a list of exogenous and endogenous factors as indicators of the institutional environment that influence to socio-innovative development. The authors obtained endogenous and exogenous linear models with two or three independent variables that demonstrate whether institutional developmental features of national and regional economies influence results of social innovation activities.

In connection with the above, the development of methodological aspects of integrated activities is an urgent task. The methodological basis of the research is a system analysis, as well as the theory of multi-agent systems. The main trends distinguishing the “digital” economy from “non-digital” one are highlighted based on the systematic approach. The concept of complex activity (CA) is defined and the ontology of the basic concepts of CA methodology is offered. An integrated and coordinated system of CA models is introduced: the basic model of the structural element of activity (SEA), which is the main atomic element of CA representation and analysis; logical model of CA, reflecting the structure of the objectives of the activity and the hierarchy of subordination of elements of the CA; causal model of CA, describing the cause-effect relationship between the elements of CA and, in fact, CA technology; process model that reflects the life cycle of activity and its elements. The role of information in the process of implementing the CA is considered. Significant factors of the role of information (information model) in the CA technology and, as a consequence, in the economy, are revealed. The chapter shows the possibility of constructive representation of complex activities in the form of multi-agent models.

Koretskaia-Garmash V.,Digital economy and labour taxation: International and Russian policies on taxing freelancers,2019,"As the digital world is merging into the real world, more and more people of all ages and backgrounds are participating in the digital economy. Information technologies are steadily permeating all spheres of life - entertainment, education, health care, security, trade, international relations. The rising popularity of remote work stimulates the free international movement of capital, which, in turn, should alert the states to the danger of revenue losses due to greater opportunities for tax fraud and tax evasion. If employers and freelancers reside in different countries, employers are likely to dodge employment taxes and evade paying social security contributions. To counter these risks and prevent financial crimes, tax authorities have embraced a wide range of digital tools, which can, for example, better inform taxpayers (employers and freelancers) about the main aspects of taxation such as the persons responsible for paying labour taxes, tax rates, tax base, tax period, tax exemptions and tax penalties. This study analyses international experience in the sphere of labour taxation in regard with digital economy and special tax regime for self-employed workers or the 'professional income tax', which has recently been introduced in Russia (still at its pilot stage). The relevant policies of China, France, Ireland and Finland in labour taxation are described and valuable insights into taxation of freelance income are garnered. The analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the special tax regime in Russia demonstrates that it can provide an effective way to reduce the shadow economy and legalize the income of self-employed citizens. © 2019 International Business Information Management Association (IBIMA).",Digital economy; Freelancer; Labour taxation; Professional income tax

"Willems A., Kamau M.",Of binding provisions and trust marks; roadmap to a global legal framework for the digital economy,2019,"The digital economy is dynamic, fast expanding, and truly global. The legal framework that currently applies to the digital economy is either divided, fragmented, ad hoc, out of date, or nonexistent. Some legal initiatives quixotically aim at stopping cross-border data flows, reflecting consumer fears regarding privacy and security or government fears about losing tax revenue. The fragmented regulatory environment does not help companies 'scale up' digital technologies; in turn, this hampers innovation and global economic growth. In addition, some less digitally developed actors complain that current rules allow or even foster unfair competition. This article proposes a new and global legal framework for the digital economy: structured cooperation between states and companies under the administration of an autonomous body. States may resist giving up sovereignty, and citizens may fear erosion of their legal rights. However, uniform, consistent, and enforceable rules would benefit both states and citizens. Tax revenue could be fairly assessed and distributed, for example, and citizens and businesses would no longer face divergent privacy and security rules. Regulation would become more legitimate because both public and private stakeholders would participate in rulemaking, including smaller players and digital latecomers. Companies that subscribe to the framework would receive a global 'trust mark' that would boost consumer confidence. In sum, a global legal framework, as contemplated, would match the global character of activities in the digital economy. © 2019 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands",

Zavalko N.A.,Current problems in the training of digital personnel for the cyber economy and how to solve them,2019,"Purpose: The purpose of this chapter is to study the current problems of training digital personnel for the cyber economy and to propose solutions. Methodology: On July 28, 2017, the Government of the Russian Federation adopted a Decree on the implementation of a program of the digital economy in Russia. Its purpose is to form the infrastructure for a comprehensive information-based economy and to train personnel to develop the Russian digital economy. Thus, Russia plans to perform a qualitative transformation of the economy by 2024. This requires action in the following spheres: modernization of the digital infrastructure, implementation of digital practice into all key sectors of the economy, and the training of skilled personnel for the transitional period. In order to prepare skilled digital personnel, it is necessary to rebuild the conservative system of education and to stimulate graduates to work within the digital sphere. Universities have a key responsibility in this process, as they control the main concentrations of knowledge. Results: By outlining the main problems surrounding the training of personnel for the digital economy, we determine ways to solve them: increased financing of education in the sphere of digital technologies, differentiating programs for the training of IT specialists, and involving large companies in the educational process through the organization of internships and further employment for graduates. Conclusions: The current Russian system of education pays insufficient attention to the training of competent specialists in the sphere of information technologies. However, Russia has the resources to overcome this problem and train skilled personnel through the provision of attractive jobs with scope for professional growth. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",

"Pujadas R., Curto-Millet D.",From matchmaking to boundary making: Thinking infrastructures and decentring digital platforms in the sharing economy,2019,"While digital platforms tend to be unproblematically presented as the infrastructure of the sharing economy – as matchmakers of supply and demand – the authors argue that constituting the boundaries of infrastructures is political and performative, that is, it is implicated in ontological politics, with consequences for the distribution of responsibilities (Latour, 2003; Mol, 1999, 2013; Woolgar & Lezaun, 2013). Drawing on an empirical case study of Uber, including an analysis of court cases, the authors investigate the material-discursive production of digital platforms and their participation in the reconfiguring of the world (Barad, 2007), and examine how the (in)visibility of the digital infrastructure is mobilized (Larkin, 2013) to this effect. The authors argue that the representation of Uber as a “digital platform,” as “just the technological infrastructure” connecting car drivers with clients, is a political act that attempts to redefine social responsibilities, while obscuring important dimensions of the algorithmic infrastructure that regulates this socioeconomic practice. The authors also show how some of these (in)visibilities become exposed in court, and some of the boundaries reshaped, with implications for the constitution of objects, subjects and their responsibilities. Thus, while thinking infrastructures do play a role in regulating and shaping practice through algorithms, it could be otherwise. Thinking infrastructures relationally decentre digital platforms and encourage us to study them as part of ongoing and contested entanglements in practice. © 2019 by Emerald Publishing Limited.",Algorithms; Digital infrastructures; Digital platforms; Performativity; Sharing economy; Uber

"Popkova E.G., Haabazoka L.",The cyber economy as an outcome of digital modernization based on the breakthrough technologies of industry 4.0,2019,"Purpose: The purpose of this chapter is to provide a critical analysis of the initial results of digital modernization in the modern economy based on the breakthrough technologies of Industry 4.0. The chapter also introduces the concept of the ‘Cyber Economy’ as a new type of economic system. The chapter illustrates that the cyber economy is a product of digital modernization, provides a definition of the cyber economy and also scientifically substantiates the logic and sequence of the birth of the cyber economy. Design/methodology/approach: Because the expected result of any country’s modernization is to enhance the livelihoods of its citizens, an assessment of the effect of the level of an economy’s digital competitiveness on the population’s living standards was conducted. The assessment was done with the help of regression analysis using statistical data from the IMD World Competitiveness Center and Numbeo. The research was conducted on countries with the highest level of digital competitiveness in 2018, including Russia. The rationale behind the selection of countries was that they are the only ones where there is a statistically significant influence of digital modernization on the population’s living standards. Findings: As a result of studying the peculiarities of various technological modes, the stages of digital modernization for the economy based on the breakthrough technologies of Industry 4.0 were characterized as follows: the information economy, the digital economy, and, ultimately, the cyber economy. A conceptual model of the cyber economy was built reflecting its technological mode, objectives and means of management, criterion for measuring the effectiveness of management, new subjects of economic relations, and new spheres of the economy.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors use regression analysis for determining the current value of digital personnel for the forming cyber economy (at the current stage of the digital economy) and for evaluating the influence of the share of specialists in the sphere of information and communication technologies (ICTs) at the level of digital competitiveness as an indicator of readiness for transition to the cyber economy. The research is performed using a selection of countries that show the best results in the sphere of digital modernization of economy (Top 30) in 2018. The information and analytical basis of the research is statistical data produced by the National Research University “Higher School of Economics” and the IMD. Findings: It is determined that a high level of automatization (up to full autom-atization) can only be achieved at one of the four stages (the production stage) using the algorithm for the creation of added value in the conditions of the cyber economy. All other stages will require different types of digital personnel, including specialists in the spheres of ICT, machine building, and extremely specialized sectoral digital personnel, who will have the key role, performing essential functions with machine technical support. Originality/value: It is established that there is a low level of risk of a social crisis in the labor market. It is shown that specialists with high levels of qualification will be in the highest demand. The main priority in the training and development of digital personnel should be paid not to quantitative (number of personnel trained) but qualitative indicators (the level of personnel qualification). © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",

"Rogulenko T.M., Ponomareva S.V., Krishtaleva T.I.",Competition between intelligent machines and digital personnel: The coming crisis in the labor market during the transition to the cyber economy,2019,"Purpose: The purpose of the chapter is systemic study of the future labor market in the cyber economy in view of the influence of not only the demographic factor but also of the more important technological factor, which is connected to formation and increase of competition between intellectual machines and digital personnel. Methodology: The authors determine the influence of the demographic and technological factors on the future of the Russian labor market. The authors perform analysis of statistical data for the Russian labor market, which allows forecasting further expansion of the spheres and popularization of automatization of the production and distribution processes in the Russian economy. Thus, the need for digital personnel will reduce, as their functions will be taken over by intelligent machines. Results: It is determined that in modern Russia no efforts are made for assessment of the potential needs for digital personnel either at the government, university, or corporate levels. Training of digital personnel is announced as a strategic priority of the national program “Digital economy of the Russian Federation” dated July 28, 2017, No. 1632-r. In view of the determined highly probable negative influence of the technological factor (growth of competition of intelligent machines and digital personnel), it is possible to forecast a crisis of the Russian labor market in the future. Conclusions: It is substantiated that a crisis is imminent in the Russian labor market: firstly, due to growth of competition of digital personnel under the influence of the increase of their number and, secondly, due to establishment and growth of competition of intelligent machines and digital personnel. It is concluded that it is necessary to have state anti-crisis management of the Russian labor market. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",

"Abdulkadyrov A.S., Aliyev R.M., Badavov G.B.",Edtech: The scientific and educational platform for training digital personnel for the cyber economy,2019,"Purpose: The purpose of this chapter is to develop a conceptual model for a university based on EdTech and a scientific and educational platform to train digital personnel for the cyber economy. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use the case method to analyze Russia’s experience to date with the EdTech sector. In addition, through the use of the statistical data of the World Economic Forum for 2016 and the IMD for 2018 the authors assess the efficiency of the scientific and educational platform for training digital personnel for the cyber economy. Findings: It is substantiated that the existing paradigm for training digital personnel for the cyber economy does not offer universal practical solutions. The generally accepted theory on the division of scientific and educational functions for EdTech subjects do not conform to the needs of modern Russia and instead of stimulating the development of digital personnel restrain digital modernization due to a deficit of competencies and the low effectiveness of the scientific and educational infrastructure for digital business. Originality/value: The authors specify the conceptual foundations of the process for the formation of EdTech—which is to become a scientific and educational platform to train digital personnel for the cyber economy. The developed conceptual model of a hi-tech university using EdTech and a scientific and educational platform to train digital personnel reduces uncertainty and provides solutions to current training problems. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",

"Grosheva P.Y., Bondarchuk N.V.",Digital competence as a measure of employee competitiveness in the labor market of the cyber economy,2019,"The authors show that in the conditions of the cyber economy digital competence is one of the key factors of employee competitiveness in the labor market. The authors determine interconnections between technical modernization and reequipping of organizations and the need for the development of employee competencies to create cyber-physical systems of management. The importance of the task of diagnostics in order for managers to assess employee competencies according to the modern requirements of the cyber economy is substantiated. This task is important for all categories of a company’s personnel: managers, specialists, and employees who are either involved in key scientific and production activities or have roles related to their organization and maintenance. A methodology of diagnostics for employee competence is offered. It is used to determine the need for development of digital competencies in the conditions of the cyber economy and is based on the implementation of a three-stage algorithm, which contains the model of evaluation of the level of competency. The authors distinguish competencies that are the most important for development of personnel in the conditions of the cyber economy to support a high level of organizational competitiveness. The diagnostic tool makes it possible to measure how closely employee competencies conform with the conditions of the cyber economy, and take decisions to plan improvements if they are deemed necessary. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",

Serafin M.,Contesting the digital economy: Struggles over Uber in Poland,2019,"Over the past few years Uber has experienced more controversy than any other digital platform. Looking at the case of Uber in Poland, this chapter distinguishes four arenas in which Uber has been contested: In cities, in public opinion, in the political realm, and in the legal field. Each of these arenas has a different logic and dynamic and also involves different actors and institutions. Nevertheless, the various struggles are connected with each other. Victories and defeats in one spill over into another, providing actors with resources or imposing constraints on them. The author illustrates the connection between various arenas by looking at court cases involving Uber drivers in Poland and shows how those court cases were not only legal events that determined the legality of Uber in Poland but also moral and political events that influenced struggles over legitimacy that were taking place outside the courtroom. © 2019 by Emerald Publishing Limited.",Court cases; Digital platforms; Legality; Legitimacy; Political contestation; Uber

"Lobova S.V., Bogoviz A.V.",Embracing artificial intelligence and digital personnel to create high-performance jobs in the cyber economy,2019,"Purpose: The purpose of the chapter is to study the process of creating highly efficient jobs in the cyber economy through the integration of AI and employees’ mastering new digital competencies. Methodology: Evolutional (historical) methods, analysis, synthesis, and algorithmization are used. Conclusions: It is determined that the modern labor market is peculiar for the emergence of a new type of employee—AI. The management of labor efficiency in the cyber economy is oriented not at humans but at robots, which reduces production costs. Depending on the level of coding of operations, highly efficient jobs in the cyber economy are either fully replaced by AI or envisage effective interactions between humans and AI. In the latter case, human employees will need to continually improve and develop their cyber competencies. In order to measure the efficiency of a job working with AI, there has to be an integral indicator taking account of the usage of resources, involvement of employees, and work satisfaction. Originality/value: The authors propose competencies that employees have to possess with the wide implementation of AI technologies. They reflect on the conditions in which highly efficient jobs could be created, and offer a vision for the transformation of jobs into highly efficient jobs within the cyber economy. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",

Digitalization of education is already changing the traditional education system. It is manifested in the following: The number of virtual educational platforms is increasing; one electronic resource can be used many times to provide educational services of various content; new technologies are being introduced into education and digital educational platforms that provide services; there is a widespread use of online courses, simulators, interactive whiteboards, projectors, 3D printers, etc. In order to determine the vision of entrepreneurial education, 62 students of the Faculty of Economics of the Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation were interviewed. At the same time 45 entrepreneurs with experience in business for more than 5 years were also interviewed. The following questions were included in the questionnaire: Requirements for the learning outcomes and the educational process; implementation methods, desired forms of training, interactive tools, methods of conducting classes; barriers to implementing interactive learning tools. It has been established that the most popular requirement is to increase the level of practical skills in the specialty. At the same time, students report a lack of communication between universities and potential employers. According to the results of the survey and taking into account the opinion of entrepreneurs, for the formation and development of partnerships between business and universities, it is necessary to reform such a model of cooperation as university-state-business. Based on the results of the survey, it can be concluded about the public request for the introduction of SMART education.

"Grigoreva E.A., Garifova L.F., Polovkina E.A.",The future of digital technology in russia: Blockchain as one of the priority directions of development,2019,"Today, Russia is working seriously on the development of “end-to-end” digital technologies in the next five years. The national project “Digital Economy” highlights nine major “end-to-end” digital technologies, among which much attention is paid to the development of blockchain technology. As for the priority areas of introducing blockchain technology in Russia, we can distinguish five main ones: finance and insurance, transportation and storage, public administration, healthcare and manufacturing. In finance and insurance, the blockchain is expected to significantly reduce the costs of clearing and settling transactions, as well as halve the duration of transactions. The use of block-chain in the manufacturing industry will lead to a significant cost saving in paper flow and quality control of raw materials. In logistics, the blockchain will halve the cost of moving goods, as well as minimize the number of errors when sending them. The blockchain technology, according to experts, will also be able to increase public confidence in public administration where it will be applied. It will also help reduce government administrative costs for the provision of public services. Due to the use of new technology, the circulation of counterfeit medical products will be halved, as will the costs of processing and storing personal medical data. Among the problems of implementation and development of the blockchain technology in Russia, the following can be highlighted: it takes a lot of time to integrate the system into business processes (about 120 hours), to audit smart contracts requires long time, moreover, it is necessary to reduce the time for confirmation of blocks. © 2019, Research Trend.

Ginsburg R.,Investor-state dispute settlement in the digital economy: The case for structured proportionality,2019,"The surge of economic nationalism and cross-border technology investments foreshadows disputes between inbound investors and host governments. While cross-border technology transfer is essential for economic development in many countries, host governments retain the right to safeguard citizens against potential consequences of such investments. The tension between these two concepts provides a significant challenge to the future of foreign direct investment and the global economy. For these reasons, legislators and arbitrators must develop and enforce regulations that protect public interests while enabling investors to successfully operate in the host country. In anticipation of these disputes, this article will explain how arbitral tribunals can use structured proportionality to accomplish this objective. More specifically, this article explains the causes of upcoming disputes, introduces a proportionality analysis of the government’s right to regulate and the degree to which the investor’s rights are threatened, and demonstrates how the consistent implementation of a structured proportionality test will maximize the chances that regulators and arbitrators will find balanced solutions that account for the interests of all stakeholders of FDI projects. © 2019 by Robert Ginsburg.",

Originality/value: A conceptual model for state regulation of the cyber economy based on the breakthrough technologies of Industry 4.0 is offered, according to which the digital modernization of regulatory practices also covers other areas (monitoring of economic activities, management of economic activities, and support for a favorable economic climate) through the utilization of digital technologies including blockchain, cloud technologies, the Internet of things, AI, quantum technologies, etc. Practical implementation of the developed model will satisfy the current and future needs of the cyber economy, which is currently forming in Russia, for hi-tech state regulation. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",
Holford W.D.,The future of human creative knowledge work within the digital economy,2019,"Current and near future organizational strategies are placing great emphasis on machines, robots and AI. Automation to reduce menial or repetitive jobs, digitization of work to render remaining workers more efficient and AI to provide more reliable and productive top-end professional work are all inter-related initiatives enacted by current dominant imaginaries of efficiency and maximization. We argue that there is an Ellulian phenomenon of efficient techniques spreading within technical logics that go beyond neo-liberal frontiers – namely, algorithmic approaches which attempt to capture and reduce all manners of human knowledge and meaning across the efficient explication, formalization and manipulation of signs. Such purely ‘efficient’ and analytical approaches fail to recognize the unique and inimitable characteristics of human creativity and its associated tacit knowledge. Inspirations from more holistic interpretations of Jungian symbolism allow us to provide a starting point towards comprehending the complex, ambiguous, constantly emerging and essentially hard-to-define aspects of human creativity and tacit knowledge. This, along with the argument that there exists a relationship between the democratization of knowledge and democratic decisional processes, provides the basis to present an alternative imaginary of efficiency as proposed by Feenberg (1999). Such an imaginary, allows for the democratic participation of humans in the decisional process and development of technology; and also recognizes and enacts humans as full legitimate partners with technology in their mutual shaping capacities – thus, leading to human-centric organizations. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Artificial intelligence; Creativity; Digital taylorism; Efficiency; Imaginaries

"Dincă V.M., Dima A.M., Rozsa Z.",Determinants of cloud computing adoption by romanian smes in the digital economy,2019,"The purpose of this paper is to explore the process of Cloud Computing adoption within Romanian Small and Medium sized Enterprises in the digital age. Most of the scientific papers related to this topic examine the general outlook of cloud computing implementation in Romania and focus on the use of the afore-mentioned technologies by large scale companies. In order to identify the factors that have an influence over the choice of Romanian SMEs to adopt cloud computing technology, a conceptual model has been set forth. The model’s dependent variable is the choice of the company’s management to implement cloud computing technologies. Five different independent types of variable structures which have an effect on the adoption of cloud computing within SMEs were identified. The five categories of variables are competition & government, ICT providers & firm departments, employee, manager and technological factors. Each of these categories of determinants encompasses at their turn two or more constructs. An online survey tested the model based on the responses of managers and directors from 198 Romanian SMEs from the cities of Bucharest and Cluj. The validity of the model was performed by completing factor analysis and reliability tests of the data; a logistic regression analysis was deployed to test the research hypotheses. The results emphasized that the managers’ know-how on cloud computing and the perceived costs of implementing the technology represent the main components influencing the spreading of cloud computing among Romanian SMEs. This study makes a valuable contribution to the academic environment but to businesses as well. The model can be used to examine the implementation of different innovative applications. Companies which offer cloud computing services could take advantage of the outcomes of this study to expand the degree of cloud service introduction among SMEs. © 2019 The Author(s).

The use of ICT tools is not straightforward for all the firms, namely the ones with a smaller dimension or in certain economic activities that do not understand or are not able to implement the common use of computers, internet connections or do not see as fundamental the presence in the internet, with a website for instance. Portugal is a small economy with a small local market in which the government recognizes the importance of the digital economy. However, a big way had to be run in the Portuguese business environment to achieve the standards of the European Union regarding the digital economy. For understanding the evolution of Portuguese firms on the digital economy and the adoption of ICT tools, several indicators collected by the survey on â€œInformation and Communication Technologies Usage in Enterprises (IUTICE)â€ carried out by Statistics Portugal from 2003 to 2017, are used in this research work to illustrate the evolution of ICT tools on the Portuguese business environment in the 21st century. It is concluded that Portuguese firms have understood the crucial importance of the use of computers, internet connection and presence on the internet. However, for the majority of Portuguese firms, the presence on the internet continues not to be a reality and major public and private investment is requested to implement effective measures that change the actual scenario. © 2019 International Business Information Management Association (IBIMA).",Business environment; Digital economy; Firm's dimension; Information and Communication Technologies (ICT); Portugal

Fayyaz S.,A review on measuring digital trade & e-commerce as new economic statistics products,2019,"The Internet and digitalization are fundamentally changing the way people, businesses and governments interact. This has led to a new phase of globalization underpinned by the movement of data across national borders, changing the nature, patterns and actors in international trade in goods and services. However, despite the growing importance of what is commonly referred to as digital trade, little empirical and internationally comparable information currently exists, inhibiting a full understanding of the scale and policy challenges of digital Trade, which has in turn raised concerns about the capacity of current statistics to fully capture and separate identify this phenomenon. In the other words, in digital trade economy there is a remarkable gaps and many of its statistics are not enough to fulfill the demands. It has been growing in importance, and with it, demands for detailed statistics from a number of policy areas including market access, trade facilitation, opportunities for SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises), regulation, competition, digital data flows and privacy has remained yet.

The emphasis was placed on the understanding of digital transformation as a strategic process ensuring the growth of customer focus and flexibility of manufacturing enterprises through the use of new business models, the wide use of data and the development of competencies. The prerequisites for the development of approaches and methods of management of strategic changes were identified, with the industry specifics and digital readiness of the enterprise taken into account. The Digital Maturity Model of the enterprise was used as the initial step for building the trajectory of digital transformation. As a result of the generalization of various models for assessing the level of digital development of an enterprise, five integrated evaluation units were identified: strategy, customers, organizational culture, operational processes and information technologies. A control scheme for digital transformation of a manufacturing enterprise was proposed, determining the main factors and control circuits. The developed multiple-theoretic model for constructing a trajectory of digital transformation is characterized by hierarchical ordering and structural interconnectedness of elements. The particular qualities of the transition of Russian enterprises to the digital economy were researched.

Coin F.,"Your data or your life. On demonetisation, cashlessness and the digital panopticon in India",2019,"Over the past few years, there has been a growing discussion about cashlessness. In several countries, economists, policy markers and financial institutions have advocated for a transition towards digital transactions, arguing that cashlessness can become an instrument of governance pivotal to the achievement of a more transparent and inclusive society. Conversely, cash has been described as a symbol of deviance, a symptom of illegal activities such as tax evasion and corruption. This paper focuses on the transition towards cashless transactions in India. Drawing on Noemi Klein’s definition of the shock economy, it argues that demonetisation in India can be considered as a shock therapy meant to facilitate the pursuit of a pro-corporate agenda. In a cash-based economy like India, demonetisation created a state of shock that forced large sectors of the population to adapt to digital transaction, in a process that undermined informal activities and used fear as a levy to push forward an agenda that largely benefited big credit card companies, the IT sector and fintech.

"Šiuškaitė D., Pilinkienė V., Zvirdauskas D.",The conceptualization of the sharing economy as a business model,2019,"The paper analyses the recently emerged and rapidly growing phenomenon of sharing economy. The assessment of an extensive amount of publications issued by Lithuanian and foreign researchers has revealed the problem that in most cases a simplified business model is still being applied to all sharing economy initiatives despite of their evident differences. The use of abstraction method, systematic approach and comparative research enabled the authors to examine the formation and disclosure of different sharing economy definitions and provide a revised one as well as to establish the chronological process of the development of the phenomenon. Moreover, the research also presents the peculiarities of the sharing economy as a new business model by highlighting its characteristics and dimensions and emphasizing the social, economic and ecological key factors and the main drivers such as monetization of excess or unused assets, increasing financial flexibility, the impact of venture capital, access over ownership, increasing urbanization etc. The outcome of this research is the conceptual sharing economy business model that allows not only to understand the functioning of the sharing economy better but also to grasp the differences of already existing initiatives and to find opportunities to create new ones. This may help for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers not only guide future research and policy intervention but also find valuable insights for sharing economy business models development and better foreseen the results of this phenomena. © 2019, Kauno Technologijos Universitetas.

"Yildirim N., Tunçalp D.",A policy design framework for digital transformation: University-based Innovation and Entrepreneurship Ecosystems Revisited,2019,"The digital economy requires strong interaction among its constituents and a co-creation climate so that the expected socio-economic values are acquired. Within this general framework, there is a need for understanding the dimensions of digital transformation which can affect or even disrupt, or be driven by from technological entrepreneurship ecosystems. In the digital transformation era, especially university-based innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystems are expected to play an essential role in building linkages between researchers, technology start-ups, idea/ prototype developers and industrial enterprises. In this context, our study aims to explore the possible roles of science and technology universities for the adaptation and development of Industry 4.0 technologies for manufacturing industry through their participation in innovation ecosystems. We also analysed the linkages between these roles and the challenges of adapting Industry 4.0 technologies. After a content analysis in previous literature, in-depth interviews were conducted with 15 experts from (4 Managers from UIEEs, ten industrial experts working on digital transformation in the manufacturing industry, two management consultants and three academicians). AHP (Analytical Hierarchical Process) multicriteria decision-making method and needs analysis by quality function deployment techniques are utilized to combine pillars of digital transformation pillars (that include (1) challenges and (2) Industry 4.0 tools and technologies that are applicable to manufacturing industry) with the key roles of Science and Technology Universities which contributes to technological innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystems. Additionally, with experts we discussed the potential challenges of Universities for effectively performing their roles in innovation ecosystems for adapting Industry 4.0 technologies and digital transformation. Finally we proposed a technology policy design framework that can provide appropriate policy options on embedding university-based innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystems (UIEE) in digital transformation roadmap for the manufacturing industry in Turkey as a case study for developing countries to promote sustainable innovation in critical industries. © IAMOT 2019.",Digital Convergence; Digital Transformation; Industry 4.0; Innovation Networks; Triple Helix; University-based Entrepreneurship Ecosystems; University-industry Collaboration
"Salido-Andrés N., Rey-García M., Alvarez-González L.I., Vázquez-Casielles R.",Determinants of success of donation-based crowdfunding through digital platforms: The influence of offline factors,2019,"The purpose of this research consist of exploring the extent to which factors traditionally explaining the success of offline fundraising campaigns for social causes may also influence the success of donationbased crowdfunding (DCF) campaigns promoted by social economy organizations (SEO) through digital platforms. Firstly, factors determining the success of offline fundraising campaigns for social causes are identified from previous literature. Secondly, a set of hypotheses linking these determinants to DCF campaigns is proposed. Thirdly, their explanatory capacity is measured through quantitative analysis based on a database of 360 campaigns fostered by small, medium and large-size organizations via Microdonaciones, a donation-based crowdfunding digital platform, for the period between 2012 and 2017. Logistic regression analysis is used to test the hypotheses proposed. Results confirm the high explanatory capacity of determinants related to the geographical scope of the campaign, the volume of potential beneficiaries involved -in these two cases in unexpected ways-, and the information provided by the promoting organizations. However, factors related to the timing of the campaigns do not influence their success. This research suggests that not only the funding channels and tools but also the nature of the fundraising campaigns themselves have been digitally transformed. Implications of this research may assist SEO in establishing effective relationships with new digital donors in order to achieve sustainable growth. © 2019 CIRIEC-España, Revista de Economía Pública, Social y Cooperativa.",Digital platforms; Donation-based crowdfunding; Fundraising campaigns; Social causes; Sustainable social economy organizations
"Wortmann F., Joppen R., Drewel M., Kühn A., Dumitrescu R.",Developing and evaluating concepts for a digital platform,2019,"No other area shows such a potential for disruption as digital platforms. B2C platforms, like Amazon and Uber, have radically changed the market situations within their industry. Until today, this change has mainly taken place in the B2C sector. Still, first platforms are already established in the B2B sector. Examples are Adamos in manufacturing and 365FarmNet in agriculture. With the entrance into the platform economy, companies are confronted with huge challenges. One question is whether a platform can be established in a certain industry due to its specific characteristics. Further questions are how a promising overall platform concept looks like, what relevant platform services are and who the essential actors on the platform are. In literature, there are different approaches for describing the benefits of a platform and designing a basic platform setup. Examples are the Platform Design Toolkit and Platform Value Canvas, which can be used for describing a platforms value proposition. Another example is the Platform Shell Model to describe the stakeholders of a platform. Still, those methods do not help companies to create a basis for decision-making for a platform strategy. In this paper we present a method for developing and evaluating concepts of a digital platform. Based on our project experience, we derived a thorough procedure complemented with adequate methods to do so. The starting point is the question of how a company should act regarding platforms in a certain industry. The goal is to develop platform concepts and to provide an initial evaluation. All relevant actors of an industry and their pains and gains should be considered. The platform concepts are based on the assumption that a platform can be described by its services and actors. The services should also be bundled into clusters with regard to their synergies in order to obtain consistent concepts. The validation shows that different platform concepts are promising depending on the ecosystem. The most attractive services crystallize individually for each branch. Summing up, this paper describes a thorough approach for developing and evaluating concepts of a digital platform. The results are a starting point for the development of a detailed concept and a platform strategy. © IAMOT 2019.",Digital Platform; Digitization; Platform Economy

The topic is of relevance as the acquisition of knowledge and its conversion into dynamic capabilities provides enterprises with the possibility to go through digital transition and transform the acquired knowledge into modified business models, innovative products, and upgraded services. Since the first crafting of absorptive capacity theory in the beginning of 1990s, there has been ample research on its application in medium and large companies. The contribution of this study is that it assesses the concept of absorptive capacity and its impact on firm performance in start-ups. The methodological approach involves quantitative data analysis using a survey applied to a sample of 44 blockchain start-ups measuring the following variables: acquisition, assimilation, transformation, and exploitation. We analyzed firm performance through a variety of concepts previously tested in other studies, sales growth, profit growth, growth in market share, and growth in return on capital, and found a positive relationship between AC and firm performance in blockchain start-ups. However, based on our findings, we cannot conclude that blockchain start-ups are more successful because of their AC. Therefore, we suggest further examination of items more specific to the demands of an increasingly digital economy. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",Absorptive capacity; Blockchain; Digital transformation; Firm performance; Start-ups; Technology

Christoffels M.,A framework for managing change leadership in a digital transformation environment,2019,"Digital business transformation is disrupting businesses in every industry by breaking down barriers between people, businesses and things, as by breaking these barriers, they can create new products and services, and find more efficient ways of doing business. Digital transformation involves the reshaping of the very context and structure of organisations - which has implications for leadership practice and theory regarding leaders' abilities, capabilities and how they implement this change. Organisations tend to consider successful managers for these initiatives; however, a successful management career is not the same as leading an effective group, team or organisation. This is because the personality characteristics, motives and behaviours that predict career success differ from those that predict leading an effective team or organisation. This implies that successful change leaders influence organisations by creating an environment for teams to be motivated and involved. The central challenge for change leaders is to improve success in the detection, assessment and exploitation of ICT-related innovation opportunities. The leadership skills required can be seen to comprise a set of competencies which an individual in the digital economy requires to initiate and guide innovation utilising ICT. A leader in such a setting must communicate effectively with the teams, and fully understand the tools for supporting decision optimisation. This requires not only profound, leading-edge ICT exploitation skills, but also mature business skills, as well as skills in communication and organisation. These ICT-mediated environments are now impacting the way we understand leadership, as early researchers have observed a co-evolution between technology and leadership - which they labelled eLeadership. Not only has technology impacted upon leadership, but leadership itself may be transformed, due to its impact with technology. This phenomenon has motivated this study to develop a framework for eLeadership capabilities required in digital transformation initiatives, with a holistic view of the organisation and its environment, where it can be viewed as a dynamic system in which eLeadership contributes to reaching the organisational goals. © 15th European Conference on Management, Leadership and Governance, ECMLG 2019.

The main problems that need to be solved are developing innovative strategies to manage human development and to consider the digital change influence. The current research purpose is to define an available institutional background to create different strategy models for human development under the condition of global digital change in Ukraine. The article is based on international indicators of human development and digital change in Ukraine, which has been analyzed to define current national economy positions and calculate probable strategies. The main constitutive characteristics, features, and functions of human development components are defined. The dynamic and static analysis of national human development positions is made (HDI, HCI, PI). The strengthening, neutral and weakening of national economy are researched (SNW analysis). A framework of macro-environmental factors for human development in the area of digital change is scanned (PEST analysis). The above mentioned strategic models create basic to calculate possible innovative strategies probabilities under conditions of global digital change (Transition matrix of Markov chain).

Kutukova E.S.,A model for sustainable development in the cyber economy: The creation and implementation of green innovations,2019,"Purpose: The purpose of this chapter is to develop a model for the sustainable development of the cyber economy based on the creation and implementation of “green” innovations. Design/methodology/approach: In order to study the issue of sustainable development of the cyber economy based on “green” innovations the author uses the method of regression analysis. The author determined the influence of the values of the indices of digital competitiveness, calculated by the IMD, on the values of indices for the green economy, calculated by Dual Citizen LLC in early 2019 (based on data from late 2018). The countries selected for the research are those with the highest values in the green economy index (Top 33). To logically explain the determined regression dependence the author performs a SWOT analysis of sustainable development for the cyber economy based on the creation and implementation of “green” innovations. Findings: It is determined that the formation of the cyber economy may stimulate the achievement of global goals in the sphere of sustainable development. Potential environmental risks, which appear or increase with the cyber economy, could be prevented or reduced through the adoption of the offered model for sustainable development of the cyber economy. The model is based on the circular mechanism of industrial production, tax stimulation of R&D, and responsible consumption. Originality/value: Practical implementation of the developed model will support the high ecological effectiveness of the cyber economy through a reduction in the consumption of natural and energy resources. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",
Osipov V.S.,The rise of unemployment in the cyber economy,2019,"The goal of this chapter is to assess the impact of the transition to a digital economy on the labor force. To achieve this goal, the methods of analysis, synthesis, comparison, and statistic modeling have been used. Digital technologies are becoming increasingly ubiquitous and while raising labor efficiency, there are negative impacts on workers who lose employment. How to solve the problem of a redundant workforce is a critical issue as there is no strategy for this adaptation. Active and passive measures to combat technological unemployment, proposed by scientists and politicians, are ineffective and cannot realistically provide a livelihood for the huge number of workers released. Therefore, the question of the displacement of living objects by IT objects remains open. The results obtained in the course of this study can be used in further studies on structural (technological) unemployment and the problems of the labor market in the cyber economy. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",

The research is divided into three main blocks: characteristics of the main directions of such integration, determining potential problems, and the development of proposals for its acceleration. The research shows that in the modern conditions of widespread digitization, the rapid development of universities, scientific institutes, and industrial companies could and should be built on a close and systemic approach to integration processes and on the creation of a unified closed cyclic system, which satisfies the disparate needs of the digital economy: from the training of skilled personal to the implementation of applied R&D to industrial production through the application of modern digital technologies. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",

Design/methodology/approach: The authors perform analysis of the factors of production in the cyber economy and determine the current problems for the business sector, which are connected to imperfection of governmental regulation in the cyber economy. Modeling of the behavior pattern of the market entity and information asymmetry in the goods and services market is performed. Findings: The authors develop the scientific and methodological provision of the decision-making process in the cyber economy, which includes the algorithm of this process (which reflects its sequence and logical structure) and formulas for evaluating its efficiency at the corresponding stages. Originality/value: The authors determine that information asymmetry will be present in any market. In the business sector, however, it should be minimized. This can be achieved through thorough control over information on the part of the state, nonprofit organizations, and people engaged in socially important areas of activities (in educational, medical organizations, etc.), as well as through the support of the decision-making process.

At present, business organization are moving towards Industry 5.0 (internet of thought) and GIG economy where the traditional way of fully relying on full time workers are no longer relevant. The world of work is changing. From organizational view, leap frogging strategy with technological advancement are significant to achieve competitive advantage to ensure the continuity of business. While from worker perspective, having technology driven talent is a must to face new business economy called as GIG economy. In other words, all workers in every industry including logistics should ensure they have technology driven talent in his/her portfolio to remain competitive in the working world. Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore the applicability of Industry 5.0 such as digitalization and mobile marketing to logistics players; to make them more visible to customer and competitor. Single case study method was adopted to study on the perspective as discussed above more in-depth. Findings from this single case study is transferable as it provides rich explanation and discussion from one of the earliest logistics company in Malaysia, with logistics experience almost five (5) decades in providing logistics services. The qualitative findings pointed out four key areas for LSP improvement. Firstly, all LSPs should go for transition process with their business model to provide them with new revenue - logistics digital business and allow them to be more visible to their customer by fully utilizing the promotion activities online. Secondly, every agreement with customer should be put into contract and it is paperless within system. Thirdly, digital payment is a must to all logistics players to practice in order for them to compete in digital era. Finally, and inevitability, to sustain in the business, logistics may move to become intelligent logistics players with carrying no asset and just focus on negotiating contracts with customers. This term refers to practising logistics players with no assets or less assets centric. In principle, the company does not own asset but able to provide logistics services (for example fleet and warehouses) by aggregating ""information about assets"" from people who do own them by leveraging on data.

"Bornman M., Wessels J.",The tax compliance decision of the individual in business in the sharing economy,2019,"Digital innovation is creating completely new ways to do business, unlocking a new generation of micro entrepreneurs who are progressively engaging with the sharing economy. One of the most pressing challenges tax authorities face is the tax compliance of these individuals that are new to business in the sharing economy. Kamleitner, Korunka and Kirchler (2012) developed a conceptual framework that depicts key aspects that distinguish small business owners' perceptions of their tax obligation. Using Kamleitner et al.'s framework as a basis and analysing evidence from the literature, this article aims to point out additional considerations in order to develop a revised and extended framework of the factors influencing tax compliance of individuals in business in the home-sharing economy. The results of the study propose a framework depicting the four main factors that influence the tax compliance decision, namely: (1) perceived opportunity; (2) tax knowledge; (3) decision-making, and (4) person. © 2019 UNSW Business School™.",Decision making; Perceived opportunity for non-compliance; Sharing economy; Tax compliance; Tax knowledge

The authors present arguments confirming the need for digital transformation of the regional government system within the framework of the governmental program Â«Digital Economy of the Russian FederationÂ», aimed at creating the necessary social and economic conditions for improving the competitiveness of the economy, improving the living standards of citizens, and ensuring economic growth through the use of information technologies in both business and public administration. The regions of the Far North were chosen as the object of study, since the issues of modernization of management technologies are the most relevant there. The article proposes a classification of the main tools of digital transformation of regional management systems, a comparative analysis is conducted, and advantages and disadvantages are identified. As a methodology for digital transformation, the article uses the concept of a set of regional indicators, with the help of which a general scheme for the implementation of digital transformation of the socio-economic development of the Far North is presented.

Because task demand is a major factor that influences how computerized systems are used to make decisions, identifying task demand automatically provides an opportunity for designing advanced decision support systems that can respond to user needs at a personalized level. A first step for designing such advanced decision tools is to investigate possibilities for developing automatic task load detectors. Grounded in decision making, eye tracking, and machine learning literature, we argue that task demand can be detected automatically, reliably, and unobtrusively using eye movements only. To investigate this possibility, we developed an eye tracking task load detection system and tested its effectiveness. Our results revealed that our task load detection system reliably predicted increased task demand from users' eye movement data. These results and their implications for research and practice are discussed. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Adaptive decision making; Cognitive effort; Eye tracking; Human computer interaction; Machine learning; Task demand

"Larina T.N., Zavodchikov N.D., Larin P.E.",Agro-economic potential and prospects of implementation of precision farming technology in Russian regions,2019,"Russia has significant production and scientific potential that can contribute to the development of the agro-industrial complex. Still, agricultural production in Russia was not perceived as an object of technological innovation for a long time. The growing demand for agricultural products in the domestic and world markets and the recent shortage of specialized experts (due to outflow of the population from the village) and of material resources (due to the unbalanced development in the country's economy) requires agricultural producers to look for ways of a more rationalized use of resources and an increase in labor productivity. Modern technologies of precision farming can provide a solution to this problem, and there is a need for a thorough scientific study and a lot of systematic monitoring. The article presents the results of research on the scale of precision farming technology (PFT) distribution in the Orenburg region. Agriculture plays a significant role in the region's economy, with about 14% of the employed population working in agriculture and 10.3 million hectares of land being used for agricultural purposes. On the basis of the computational-constructive method, the authors of the article calculated the forecast for the medium-term perspective of the industry's performance indicators taking into account the implementation of individual elements of this technology in the crop production of the region. According to the authors, the development of PFT on the basis of information and communication technologies directly determines the prospects for the development of the digital economy of agriculture in Russia. © 2019 International Business Information Management Association (IBIMA).",Agricultural production; Digital economy; Precision farming technologies (PFT); Russia
Jedličková B.,Digital polyopoly,2019,"The digital economy has significantly changed many aspects of our lives, including the way firms do business and compete with each other. In addition to the benefits the digital world has introduced, it has also brought challenges for competition law, including new ways to restrict competition, with computing algorithms representing one of the most prominent examples. Algorithms can lead to, facilitate and maintain anticompetitive collusion, and one of the most pressing tests for competition law and its enforcement in the digital world is algorithmic parallel conduct. The terminology introduced for this conduct in this article is ‘digital polyopoly’. Digital polyopolies encompass conditions similar to oligopolies, in particular, interdependency and transparency. However, unlike parallel conduct arising from oligopolies, digital polyopolies are not limited by their number of competitors. This new phenomenon requires fitted interpretation and rethinking of existing competition-law and economic concepts. What digital polyopolies are, how they differ from pre-digital era concepts and how competition law should tackle them (with a particular emphasis on the European Union competition law’s concept of ‘concerted practice’), are questions explored in this article. © 2019 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands.",

Methodology of this approach is based on application of competence-based approach to education and learning, the method of compiling a map of competences of a modern specialist, and the method of graphic interpretation of authors’ conclusions and recommendations (the method of data formalization). As a result of studying the structure and logic of organization of the educational services market and labor market by the example of modern Russia, it is concluded that a narrow specialization of employees is in demand. Business processes of modern Russian companies are strictly differentiated; ordinary employees, innovators, and technical specialists are separated. In the conditions of knowledge economy’s formation and formation of Industry 4.0, wide specialization of employees will be in demand. As production functions will be automatized, the number of companies’ employees will be reduced, and each employees will have to conform to requirements from all three categories. Transition to new requirements to a modern specialist in the conditions of knowledge economy’s formation and formation of Industry 4.0 will be related to transformation changes in the system of his professional competences. We compiled a map of professional competences of a modern specialist in the conditions of knowledge economy’s formation and formation of Industry 4.0 and distinguished three main professional competences, which a production specialist should possess in the conditions of knowledge economy and Industry 4.0: competence of generation of innovations, computer programming, and digital thinking. According to the above transformation changes in the system of professional competences of a modern specialist in the conditions of knowledge economy’s formation and formation of Industry 4.0, it is necessary to pass from narrow specialization of specialists’ training to creation of wide specialization of employees. For that, an innovational approach (Fig. 1) to teaching and training of a modern specialist in the conditions of knowledge economy’s formation and formation of Industry 4.0 is presented. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2019.",Industry 4.0; Innovational approach to teaching and training of specialists; Knowledge economy; Modern specialist; System of professional competences
"Polbitsyn S., Kliuev A., Iashin A.",Can entrepreneurs drive the Russian economy into the future?,2019,"The giant leap of Russia from planned economy to free market economy in 1990s created both opportunities and disillusions for the Russian population. However, since 1990, the government of the Russian Federation has begun to proclaim small businesses and private enterprises as a panacea for the restoration of the Russian economy. This study aims to identify the potential of the Russian entrepreneurship to become the engine for the Russian economic system. The study is based on the descriptive quantative analysis of official statistical data on SMEs in Russia for the period 2000 - 2017 supplemented with surveys of entrepreneurs. We found that three periods of the development of entrepreneurship in Russia were clearly distinguished: the period of the stable development of the country's economy in 2000-2007; the second stage began in 2008, when the ruble devaluated, which made the import of consumer goods less profitable, and local production became more efficient; and the third period, which began in 2014, was closely connected with political events. The period of sanctions and countersanctions, when imported goods, primarily food, began to disappear in the country, created exceptionally favorable conditions for small business development, which led to rapid growth of small enterprises. We conclude that the future development of the economic system of the Russian Federation depends mostly on the ability of small and medium business to evolve than on the activities of large natural resource companies. In thirty years of new economic system development Russian entrepreneurs learned basic principles of entrepreneurship and continue their education. Russian small businesses managed to evolve into one of the most effective economic forces and affirm that the next decade will be the time of turmoil for Russian entrepreneurship, but we dare to state that in the future we may expect Russian entrepreneurship progress to be better than now. The future research must be aimed on elaborating of scenarios for future development of Russian entrepreneurship. © Proceedings of the 14th European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, ECIE 2019.

"Olbert M., Spengel C., Werner A.-C.",Measuring and interpreting countries' tax attractiveness for investments in digital business models,2019,"This article analyses the tax attractiveness of locations for investments in digital business models. It identifies and assesses relevant tax rules affecting domestic and cross-border digital business models across thirty-three countries. The computation of average effective tax rates is based on the neoclassical investment model of Devereux/Griffith. Our results help to evaluate tax-related location factors in the digital economy by combining the most relevant tax parameters and rules for taxable nexus in an objective measure. We find that investments in digital business models face generally lower average effective tax rates than those in traditional business models since a high share of investment costs is immediately expensed and a higher share of activities falls within the scope of countries' tax incentives for R & D input and/or output. While more generous depreciation rules for digital investments such as software make countries relatively more attractive, our results are mostly driven by statutory tax rates, special incentive schemes such as Intellectual Property (IP) Boxes, R & D credits, and super-deductions. Overall, we acknowledge an increasing trend in tax competition for digital businesses. © 2019 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands.",

"Mitroulis D., Kitsios F.",Evaluating digital transformation strategies: A MCDA analysis of Greek tourism SMEs,2019,"The tourism industry is one of the fastest growing industries globally. It is one of the pillars, on which the Greek economy has been based on. In this context, new digital technologies play a critical role in the industry's development and performance improvement. Greek tourism enterprises should adopt digital transformation in order to meet the changing demands of customers experience and stay competitive in a constantly evolving industry. The requirements that the organisations need to meet are the right approach to innovation and technology, in accordance with the customer-centric and data-focused organisational culture. Implementing a digital transformation strategy is very important for Greek tourism SMEs in order to successfully adapt to the new technological changes and enhance customer experience, structural changes, changes in value creation and organisational performance. In addition, there is a lack of understanding around the factors that define the digital transformation of the tourism industry, due to the lack of prior research on the subject. Decision-makers satisfaction is one of the major components for the evaluation of digital transformation strategies. Taking this fact into consideration, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the level of senior managers' satisfaction, related to digital transformation strategy of Greek tourism SMEs, using multicriteria decision analysis. The research was conducted in Thessaloniki, Greece using a structured questionnaire. Data were collected from SMEs in the tourism industry. All the relevant data were processed using the MUSA method (MUlticriteria Satisfaction Analysis). The results of the study present that senior managers are not particularly satisfied, mainly with the implementation of new digital technologies and the needed skills for managing them. This paper provides further implications related to how tourism organisations could succeed in the digital era. Moreover, it attempts to help managers address this challenge more systematically, and also provides a set of criteria which could possibly be used as a guideline for managers and senior managers when they attempt to formulate a digital transformation strategy in the tourism industry. © Proceedings of the 14th European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, ECIE 2019.

"Bataev A., Koroleva L., Gorovoy A.",Innovative approaches in the financial sphere: Assessment of digital banks' performance,2019,"One of the innovative areas of Fintech is the creation and development of completely new models of a financial institution - digital banks. Research of such an innovative form of a credit institution is made in this paper, the concept of a digital bank is defined, various classifications of digital banks are reviewed and presented, criteria and characteristics are identified, by which these financial institutions can be classified. A study of the global market of digital banks was carried out using the proposed classification. The paper touches upon market segments that include digital banks built on models of classical financial institutions, and challenger banks, whose model is not built on the basis of a classical bank model, but are considered to be largely telecommunications companies offering financial services. The number of such banking organizations, the volume of capital managed by digital banks, the number of clients of relevant financial institutions, and the countries identified as leaders in forming a new form of credit organization were analyzed in the study. Promising directions for the development of digital banks were determined based on this analysis. One of the main tasks in the implementation of any innovative investment project is to evaluate its economic efficiency. In this regard, the paper analyzes the development model of the largest digital financial institution in the world - Tinkoff Bank, which was established and operates in the territory of the Russian Federation. A comparative analysis of traditional financial institutions against this bank was conducted in the study by key parameters: profitability, return on assets and the long-term capital. The research revealed that the financial digital institution model is effective and sustainable not only under favourable conditions of the economic development but also in crisis conditions. This is the best evidence of the economic efficiency of the proposed business model of the financial institution, which allows their development in all economic situations. © Proceedings of the 14th European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, ECIE 2019.

The process of improvement of the level of digital literacy requires the systemic approach and purpose-oriented influence by the state, the effectiveness of which is determined by true and relevant information about its current status. To date, scientific development of the methodological background for the assessment and organization of studies of the digital literacy is not sufficient. Conceptually, the index is calculated with regard to the federal districts of Russia with a possibility for subsequent segmentation to the level of constituent entities of the Federation and does not reflect users' and professional level of the ICT utilization.

This sharply increases the risks of digital transformation. At the same time, certain regions and cities differ greatly in their ability to adapt to future changes. In this article, we seek to determine the capabilities of Russian regions to reduce risks and adapt to digital transformation. The literature stipulates that there are several factors able to reduce these risks. First of all, they are associated with retraining, ICT and STEAM-technologies’ development, the promotion of economic activities that are less subject to automation. As a result of econometric calculations, we identified several factors that contribute to the new industries’ development (in our case, ICT development), and, accordingly, increase regional adaptivity. These factors include diversification, the concentration of human capital, favorable entrepreneurship conditions, the creative potential of residents, and the development of ICT infrastructure. We identified several regions with high social risks and low adaptivity, which are mainly the poorly developed regions of southern Russia, where entrepreneurial risks are high, STEAM specialists are not trained, shadow economy is large.

These new scenarios have awakened in the researchers several types of definitions for this type of services offered as shared economy, marketplace, digital business platform, ecosystem, etc. The common features of these services are that the applications are unique, specific and developed for each provider, the provider mediates between a service provider and a service provider, there is value creation and use of IT. Some authors consider that business models are not enough to analyse these new scenarios. The purpose of this research is to evaluate whether business models are capable of evaluating the scenarios of digital transformation. For the research methodology, we use the attributes of business models as indicators. In the preliminary bibliographic research, we find one frameworks Kübel and Zarnekow (2014). The first examines the proposed dimensions of value, architecture, network and finance, and the second examines the attributes on platforms and marketplaces. The sample was 3 service companies offered as shared economies and using platforms or marketplaces. The results showed that business models are able to identify: Value proposition refers to how organizations create value for both their customers and each party involved in service delivery; Value architecture represents how an organization’s capabilities and core competencies are configured to create and deliver value to customers. The value network defines the interorganizational relationship in a business model and focus on the different actors and ways of collaboration network. As a consequence, the value network of a platform comprises the roles of the platform’s sponsor, provider, partner and client, allowing participation in open or closed mode, and the value financing dimension relates to how revenue is generated, and costs are structured in the business model. Furthermore, the dimension of value creation refers to the architecture of the value of the company and the mechanisms that allow the creation of the value proposition; the value delivery dimension contains the elements that generate value for a defined target customer group, and the value capture dimension or profit formula describes how the company transforms the value delivered to customers into revenue and profit. The contribution is to demonstrate how business models are able to analyse the scenarios of digital transformation through business models. © IAMOT 2019.",Business Model; Digital Transformation

Nesterov E.A.,Managing the provision of resources for the creation of products to rapidly develop the cyber economy,2019,"In this chapter, the connection between the digital economy and the cyber economy is determined, and the global development trends for information technologies are analyzed. The author substantiates the need to integrate production and economic processes into a unified cyber economic system to accelerate the development and manufacture of products with competitive consumer qualities, which could occupy the dominant positions and satisfy demand in existing markets. He also advocates that rapid development products with innovative qualities and unique consumer characteristics should be launched to create new markets and satisfy new needs in society. The author formulates and solves the important task of determining the necessary level of resource provision, for the creation of both types of products with the usage of methodological tools. Management of resource provision is aimed at creating an optimal balance for all types of an organization’s resources in the global information space, which, as a result of their realization in the form of finished products, create the potential for acquiring either a large market share or satisfying market demand in new markets. The task of creating this optimal balance for all types of resources, through the optimization of business processes and organizational models is a very important element in the process of the creation of cyber economic systems. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",
Nepelski D.,How to Facilitate Digital Innovation in Europe,2019,"Digital technologies have the potential to modernise the economy. But digital innovations are disruptive. Therefore, policies need to be comprehensive and go beyond the support of the ICT sector as well as address a variety of issues: increasing returns to the use of data, heterogeneity of the digital innovation actors and ecosystem, digital skills in the non-ICT sectors, entrepreneurial culture, funding for scaling-up of new entrants, technological interoperability and intellectual property protection. At the same time, they need to counterbalance the costs of digitally driven disruptions.

"Stoian C.-A., Tohanean D.",BMI in the digital era: Competitive advantage through human capital analytics,2019,"The term ""business model"" gained popularity mainly due to the dotcom boom. In the still young literature on this subject area, first definitions were given from the economy, computer science as well as from the business administration fields. However, as we are in the digital era - the approach is to change existing businesses through business model innovation. This is a deliberate change to an existing business model or the creation of a new one that better satisfies customer needs. From a company's point of view, the greatest potential of such a transformation lies in increasing efficiency and productivity. In addition, an increase in flexibility and transparency and the individualization of products, but also an increase in sales using new digital business models are seen as potential opportunities. However, the most important assets of the firm are not the grounds and buildings, but the members. There is consensus in both practice and literature that human capital will be the most important factor of production for a company in the future, in order to be sustainable competitive. Analytics, supported by digital technology, will enable to make better, quicker and more informed decisions that are aligned to the business strategy. Human Capital Analytics (HCA) delivers critical insights about people, their preferences, what makes them more effective as well as their contribution toward the success of the business. The paper aims to define the contribution of HCA to Business Model Innovations (BMI) and its linking to the business strategy. To such ends, the authors employed a descriptive research method through a case study. Drawing lessons from it, HCA may create the competitive advantage because of certain strengths, circumstances and innovations, that may generate greater value for the organization and its shareholders. The more sustainable the competitive advantage created through HCA is, the more difficult will be for competitors to overcome the advantage. © 15th European Conference on Management, Leadership and Governance, ECMLG 2019.

In connection with the transition of the industry to big data, a new business model and financial platform is being formed. The following research hypotheses are raised: significant correlation links between the digitization of banks and the transition of the industry to big data; between digitization and the emergence of a new form of digital financial intermediation; between new technologies and the creation of a digital banking platform and the transition to an open banking platform; between the digitization of banking and the formation of a new financial ecosystem. The structuring and classification of data used in banks were carried out. The mechanism of using data in digital banks is revealed; the role of big data in the development of the model line used in banks is shown. The paper revealed the link between the financialization of the economy and a significant increase in information flows in the banking sector. In turn, big data and digital banks have created an appropriate base for the further financialization of the economy. In turn, the transition to an open banking platform and the formation by banks of a new financial ecosystem will contribute to the further financialization of the economy. © 2019 International Business Information Management Association (IBIMA).",Big Data; Digitization banking; Financial intermediation; FinTech
"Larsson A., Teigland R.",Digital transformation and public services: Societal impacts in Sweden and beyond,2019,"Through a series of studies, the overarching aim of this book is to investigate if and how the digitalization/digital transformation process affects various welfare services provided by the public sector, and the ensuing implications thereof. Ultimately, this book seeks to understand if it is conceivable for digital advancement to result in the creation of private/non-governmental alternatives to welfare services, possibly in a manner that transcends national boundaries. This study also investigates the possible ramifications of technological development for the public sector and the Western welfare society at large. This book takes its point of departure from the 2016 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report that targets specific public service areas in which government needs to adopt new strategies not to fall behind. Specifically, this report emphasizes the focus on digitalization of health care/social care, education, and protection services, including the use of assistive technologies referred to as ""digital welfare."" Hence, this book explores the factors potentially leading to whether state actors could be overrun by other non-governmental actors, disrupting the current status quo of welfare services. The book seeks to provide an innovative, enriching, and controversial take on society at large and how various aspects of the public sector can be, and are, affected by the ongoing digitalization process in a way that is not covered by extant literature on the market. This book takes its point of departure in Sweden given the fact that Sweden is one of the most digitalized countries in Europe, according to the Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI), making it a pertinent research case. However, as digitalization transcends national borders, large parts of the subject matter take on an international angle. This includes cases from several other countries around Europe as well as the United States. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, Anthony Larsson and Robin Teigland.",

Over the last three decades of the 19th century, the volume of global industrial production grew by three times. Modern history and economics distinguish three large qualitative leaps in the history of humanity—three revolutions in productive powers of society and structures of society. However, technologies change very quickly, creating new challenges in distribution of inter-sectorial and inter-country connections, as well as in the structure of labor resources and education, which stimulates emergence and formation of a new revolutionary stage of transition of countries to “Industry 4.0”. The authors analyze historical and economic tendencies of development of the modern economic society, related to “digitization” of economy and society, including development of clever services, clever data, cloud technologies, digital networks, digital science, digital education, and digital environment for living, in view of previous industrial revolutions on the path of the revolutionary transition to Industry 4.0 in the 21st century. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2019.",Digital economy; Industrial revolution; Industry; Industry 4.0; IT industry; Production
Korotchenya V.,Digital agriculture and agricultural production efficiency: Exploring prospects for Russia,2019,"In this article, in order to study the prospects for the development of digital agriculture in Russia, the technical efficiency of the Russian agriculture within the local group of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) is explored. As well as the technological gap is investigated in agricultural production in relation to countries with developed economies. On the basis of data for the period of 2000-2015, it was established that Russia has exhausted the potential of its own technologies (since the efficiency of its agriculture in the CIS is 100%), and it needs a transition to digital agriculture. The potential increase in efficiency in the transition to new technologies is 5 times. However, this will require a significant reduction in farmland and employment and, at the same time, a significant increase in investment in agricultural capital. It is proposed to use the level of efficiency of Canada, which is similar in climatic conditions to Russia, as a target efficiency increase (twice as compared with 2014 and 2015). However, even in this case, a reduction in farmland and employment and a capital increase will be necessary (and the target level of output must be taken into account). Due to the complexity of social problems, an integrated approach to the development of digital agriculture in Russia is proposed to be used within the framework of the concept of sustainable agriculture. It is also proposed to change the policy regarding state support for agriculture: the volume of increase in state support for the formation of fixed capital. © 2019, Revista Espacios.",Agricultural production efficiency; Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS); Digital agriculture

Lima V.,Towards an understanding of the regional impact of Airbnb in Ireland,2019,"This paper considers the linkages between the home-sharing platform Airbnb and the housing crisis in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA), in Ireland. This area is in the midst of a housing crisis, with a significant undersupply of housing units and rising unaffordability, especially the city of Dublin. While the sharing economy, better exemplified here by Airbnb, has become a major part of the global economy, it is less clear what is the regional impact of Airbnb, an online platform that allows people rent out part or all of their home for short stays. Among the claimed benefits for the tourism sector there are concerns that home sharing removes potential housing supply from the private rental sector to the short-term rental sector, which could aggravate the housing shortage. Along these lines, this paper documents this contemporary urban spatial issue, using rental asking prices data and data from Airbnb listings. The study does not intend to criticize the sharing platforms themselves but rather their disruptive impact and the short-term rental market within a digital economy context more widely. It is found that whilst not the only factor for the current housing crisis in Greater Dublin, Airbnb’s presence in the short-term housing is a vivid element of the current housing crisis in the country, which poses challenges for regulators and home seekers. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

In addition, among other industries in the mining industry, the quality of computer technology depends not only on indirect statistical quantitative analysis, but also on the management of safety systems and, hence, people’s lives. The concept of the main directions of the state policy in the sphere of education for 2016-2020, based on the world standards of training of CDIO engineers, creates a favorable environment for the organization of training of competent competitive specialists of a certain engineering profile for the growth of competitiveness of the mining and mining industry of the Russian Federation in the world market, obtaining key economic results and achievements. The improvement of educational methods and tools for training and advanced training of mining engineers in the current period is based on the active implementation of the Standard of global engineering education, which forms a complex environment where trained engineers must be able to “Think-Design-Implement” and “Manage” systems in a team interaction for maximum synergetic effect.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors evaluate the influence of traditional (universal) factors of economic growth: institutional development, infrastructure, financial markets, and globalization. The resulting (dependent) variable is the digital competitiveness index. The influence of these factors is assessed with the help of the method of regression analysis based on the data of the IMD, KOF, and the World Economic Forum for late 2018/early 2019. The objects studied are the most developed economies (the G7) and the leading developing countries (BRICS). Findings: It is determined that the cyber economy is, in general, strongly influenced by the traditional factors of economic growth. However, it is shown that the external factor (globalization) has only a small influence on the development of the cyber economy, while institutional provision is the most important. Developing countries have less mature and effective institutions and therefore less favorable conditions than developed countries for the development of the cyber economy. Developing countries also lag behind developed countries with regard to other factors. Originality/value: In order to level the disproportionate development of the cyber economy in developed and developing countries, we developed a mechanism to manage the key factors that offers different recommendations for countries of both groups and reflects the general logic of managing the determined factors.

We present research results, conclusions, and recommendations on the systemic involvement of intelligent machines into the socioeconomic relations in the near future. Design/methodology/approach: Not long ago it seemed that the usage of intelligent machines as an integral part of the economy would be many years away. However, the rapid technological shift in the second part of the twentieth century has enabled the intellectualization, automatization, and robotization of physical and virtual (digital) space. Intelligent machines now perform key roles in the socioeconomic relations of the cyber economy. In this chapter, the authors use content analysis of a wide range of publications, statistical analysis of the data on implementation of intelligent machines in the cyber economy, and futuristic forecasts regarding the midterm perspectives and limitations of using such agents in socioeconomic relations. Findings: The research shows that the participation of intelligent machines in the cyber economy has already been established and has a positive influence on the development of global socioeconomic relations, stimulates the growth of national economies, and provides significant labor efficiencies. Conclusions regarding the performed study and future directions of research are offered. Originality/value: It is substantiated that the benefits of using intelligent machines could be lost through economic and reputation losses. That is why there is a necessity for the institutionalization of the space of interaction between humans and intelligent machines under the condition that such intelligent agents have limited autonomy over their functioning and decision-making (i.e., they are controlled by humans), but they are also able to conduct monitoring of human activities and have the right to block human actions that are beyond their competences (through a system of controls and counterbalances). © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",

In the scientific literature, there is a certain lack of research on a comprehensive statistical description of the venture investment market in the Russian Federation. The objective of this contribution is to study the venture investment market in the economy of the Russian Federation. Hypothesis is changing innovation and invention activity in the information economy is directly correlated with the business activity in the venture capital market (VC funds). The leading method to the study of this issue is statistical, which allows performing a comparative analysis to identify factors that influence the business activity on the venture investment market of the Russian Federation. The database is a time series of Rosstat statistical indicators and the Ministry of Economic Development of the Russian Federation for 2008–2016. The tendencies of the venture capital market in Russia were reflected in the crisis of 2014–2015. The volumetric performance VC funds began to decline after a previous successful period, with both the total volume of venture capital investments, and their average size. In the structure of the innovation activity of the Russian economy, technological innovations predominate, although their share is gradually declining since 2012. The previous trend toward the development of environmental innovations gave a way to organizational innovations. The indicator called “coefficient of the invention activity” in our country is very stable over time; however, the situation is negative when compared with the major world powers. In general, the hypothesis of the relationship between the change in the innovation and invention activity in the economy and the business activity in the venture capital market was confirmed.

In a world driven by a new wave of technological change, the platform would revalue the role of think tanks, research institutions and knowledge hubs to move the global agenda in an issue of central importance for the future of society: the creation of the jobs of the future. Building on and complementing existing experiences, the T20 platform would be a digital hub for producing knowledge, informing policies and connecting potential partners to accelerate the jobs of the future, within the context of an increasing integrated global economy. It would also contribute to the development of consensual views among the research community, allowing to discard extreme visions about the jobs of the future, dispelling both overly optimistic visions with no evidence base and unwarranted fears. © Author(s) 2019.",Artificial intelligence; Digitalization; Employment; Future; G20; Gender gap; Industry 4.0; Inequality; Skills; Technology

Design/methodology/approach: The authors use the method of scenario analysis, which allows a determination of the consequences for the national food security of Russia for various scenarios of development of the AIC. The forecasts are compiled for the period until 2024. The method of regression analysis is applied to determine the dependencies of key indicators for Russia’s national food security—affordability, availability, quality, and safety—on the share of companies in the agro-industrial sector that performs innovations, and the cost volume of implemented fixed funds in this complex for the period 2009–2018 (the post-crisis period). Findings: The authors determine the positive influence of innovative development (digital modernization) in the Russian AIC at the level of national food security. This leads to the conclusion that the most optimal scenario for the development of the AIC in the cyber economy of Russia is a transition to a cyber AIC, which envisages the highest level and systemic character of automatization and the use of the breakthrough digital technologies of Industry 4.0. Within the scenario that envisages a transition to a cyber AIC the maximum (100 points) value of the indicators of food security—price accessibility, guarantee of quality and security of food products, transparency of production and distribution, full-scale information support for interested parties, and free communication with manufacturers—will be achieved.

"Nunan D., Di Domenico M.",Rethinking the market research curriculum,2019,"Addressing the challenge of aligning how market research is practiced and how it is taught has been a recurrent theme in the marketing education literature. Recently, the growth of digital marketing and new forms of customer data have disrupted many traditional aspects of marketing practice. Companies are increasingly able to collect data directly from their customers, via large technology firms or from specialist data providers. This has reduced the demand for the traditional fieldwork-based data collection that remains a core focus within the market research curricula. This article considers the past, present, and future role of market research education in the light of the changing practitioner environment. An audit of market research courses is carried out, weaknesses identified, and suggestions made to better align market research courses with evolving skills requirements. More broadly, the article challenges educators to evaluate the extent to which the marketing curriculum can respond to the disruptions brought by the emerging digital economy. © The Author(s) 2018.",digital marketing; employer needs; market research; marketing research

"Gorshkova N.V., Mytareva L.A., Shkarupa E.A., Yalmaev R.A.",The concept of tax stimulation of informatization of modern entrepreneurship,2019,"Purpose The purpose of the article is to study tax policy’s stimulation of the process of informatization of Russian entrepreneurship. Methodology The authors use the methods of systemic analysis, synthesis, induction, deduction, formalization, and table method. Results Based on systematization of peculiarities of informatization of Russian entrepreneurship at the current level of society’s technological development, the authors determine the existence of “profile” and “non-profile” organizations in the studied sphere. Motives, levels, and depth of their informatization are different—therefore, different measures of tax stimulation should be applied to them. Analysis of the existing Russian tax laws allows stating that there’s no concept of tax stimulation of informatization of Russian business. The authors determine two directions of state influence on activation of informatization of business with tax measures, which differ as to the character (voluntary or mandatory). Recently, Russia has been peculiar for tough digitization of tax administration and control, which makes informatization of taxpayers forced and mandatory. The problem of toughening of taxation of digital business is especially topical. At that, for taxpayers who are very important for development of top-priority directions of the Russian economy (e.g., information security and IT), there is a range of tax subsidies and preferences. Also, the authors note the most significant factors that define limitations and possibilities of formation of the Concept of tax stimulation of entrepreneurship’s informatization. Recommendations The authors state that tax preferences should be provided to legally functioning “profile organizations in the sphere of informatization and digitization”, as well as small and new companies. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",Digital economy; Informatization; Tax stimulation; Taxes and taxation

Today there is practically no sector of the economy without the introduction of digital technologies. The use of computer technology led to the creation of a new model of economic development - a digital economy based on the introduction of the most innovative digital technology. In the modern world, there is an active implementation of technologies that provide breakthrough directions in the development of the economy and business. One of the most promising areas in the digital economy is the design and use of artificial neural networks or artificial intelligence. They are capable of managing objects of any complexity, providing a reliable forecast based on the analysis of huge amounts of information. At present, artificial intelligence systems are used in many areas of economic development: in telecommunications companies, industry, and medicine. One of the leaders in the use of artificial neural network technology is the financial sphere. Many financial institutions apply artificial intelligence systems in scoring systems that can provide higher reliability compared to existing systems when assessing a borrower, forecasting cash flow of a credit institution, assessing the adequacy of the level of capital of a banking organization, and many other areas. The paper discusses aspects of the introduction and use of neural network technology in the financial and economic spheres, conducts a financial analysis of the global and Russian market of artificial neural network technology in the financial sector, analyzes the use of artificial intelligence systems in the financial sphere, and studies the prospects for the development of neural network technology in financial institutions. Particular attention is paid to assess the economic efficiency of the investment project under the design and implementation of innovative digital projects. It is difficult to carry out such an assessment. Therefore, the paper proposes a model of an efficiency assessment using the example of the introduction of a scoring system with artificial intelligence. © 2019 International Business Information Management Association (IBIMA).",Artificial intelligence systems; Financial institutions; Information technology management; Neural network scoring systems; Performance evaluation

Schön W.,One answer to why and how to tax the digitalized economy,2019,"The question of why and how to tax the digitalized economy has been at the top of the international tax policy debate since the inception of the BEPS Action Plan in 2013. Over the years, a number of approaches have been discussed including far-reaching proposals to fully or partially reallocate taxing rights to market countries. In recent months, three options have emerged at the level of the Inclusive Framework/OECD: international taxation on the basis of 'significant market presence', taxation according to the value of 'user contributions', and profit allocation to 'marketing intangibles'. This article attempts to assess the merits of these proposals against a number of benchmarks: revenue, fairness, and efficiency. Finally, this analysis leads to a different approach: taxation on the basis of 'digital investment' and takes the nature of the corporate income tax as a tax on return on country-specific investment seriously while addressing the legitimate concerns and aims of the current debate © 2019 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands.",

While the OECD claims in those documents that the digital economy only 'exacerbates' BEPS issues, we argue that the digital economy may also create unique BEPS issues related to Autonomous Artificial Intelligence (AAI) (specifically, the unique issues of 'disappearing income' and 'powerlessness to tax'). AAI is defined as an Artificially Intelligent system that (1) is capable of performing tasks commonly associated with human intelligence and beyond, (2) is not directly or indirectly controlled by human beings, and (3) has full managerial power over its own actions and resources, which may be contained, but not controlled by human beings or by entities (legal or otherwise) representing the interests of human beings.

Methodology For determining the current state of informatization of the modern Russia’s economy, the materials of the Global Information Technology Report 2016, provided by the World Economic Forum, are used; for studying dynamics of informatization of Russia’s economy—materials of the Measuring the Information Society Reports 2009–2017, provided by the International Telecommunication Union, are used. Regression and correlation analysis is used for determining the influence of informatization of Russia’s economy on the index of taxation, calculated by the World Bank. Results Results of the performed research showed that modern information and communication technologies allow for full authomatization of the tax system, thus ensuring its large optimization. The developed authors’ model is optimized on the basis of new information and communication technologies of the tax system. It is determined that in modern Russia the level of informatization is rather high and continues to grow, stimulating the optimization of the tax system. Most of the methods of informatization of the tax system are applied in modern Russia. The problems related to application of the methods of optimization of the taxation system with the help of informatization in modern Russia include absence of the necessary software and equipment failures.

Being part of the Digital Agenda for Europe 2020, EU initiatives such as the “eIDAS Regulation” and the “Once-Only Principle” should help to remove national barriers and enhance development of cross-border digital public services. The concept of citizen accounts enables citizens to get personalized services from their governments. Future possible uses include saving some of the frequently used formal documents that are required for government interactions online for a quick access on the citizen account. Selected government agencies could access these documents in case of an explicit consent of the citizen. Yet, the perspective of citizens on this topic involving highly sensitive documents and personal information as well as their concerns and expectations in the context of citizen accounts have barely been subject to research up to now. We question not only security related risks but also analyse privacy related risks such as lack of information about the further use of personal data and fear of central storage of personal data in government databases.

Schmidt H.,Competition law and IP rights: Not so complementary: Time for re-alignment of the goals?,2019,"This article argues through a US/EU comparative assessment of the intellectual property (IP) law goals and competition law goals that whilst the overarching goals of competition law and IP rights to enhance overall economic welfare are still complementary, internal conflicts within the two legal spheres are jeopardizing the achievement of these goals. Within the IP laws the private/public reward/incentive to innovate equilibrium is now being tilted in favour of private interests due to recent developments in terms of rapid innovation in digital economy markets and technologies coupled with an expansion of IP rights and increase in patents grants and their width. This has a knock-on effect on the application of the competition rules as a second-tier regulator of IP rights. However, the competition rules also face its own battle in keeping up with the fast-developing digital economy, the concerns regarding Big Data and online platforms raising questions about the sustainability of the ‘consumer welfare’ framework as an optimal standard to ensure effective competition in these markets. Consequently, there is a danger that the competition rules and the IP rights will be out of quilter, risking stifling of innovation and harm to consumer welfare, unless adjustment is made within the two legal spheres. © 2019 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands.",

Banterle F.,Data ownership in the data economy: A european dilemma,2019,"To unleash the potential of new data-driven opportunities, players in the data market need to have access to large and diverse datasets. Access in relation to data is therefore a crucial factor. However, the new data economy raises unsolved issues. Where a multitude of actors interact in the elaboration of data, it is often questioned: who owns the data? As part of its Digital Single Market strategy, the European Commission has started a series of initiatives aimed at addressing the data ownership issue. They culminated with the idea of introducing a novel right in raw machine-generated data. This chapter briefly summarizes the European Commission's strategy. It recalls the main characteristics of the data value chain. It then elaborates on the existing EU acquis on data ownership, deriving from intellectual property rights (namely copyright and database right), trade secrets, traditional property, and factual control situations derived by data protection laws. These ownership mechanisms are powerful although difficulty extend to raw data. Despite this, gaps in law have been filled through contractual schemes and technological access restrictions that enhance the ability to control data. The chapter further explores the position of those that support the idea of a new property right in data and elaborates on the new right proposed by the European Commission. This paper concludes that creating new monopolies capable of restricting open access to data, may result in a threat to development of an EU data market. Further, economic evidence is needed before discussing the introduction of such a new right. Indeed, we should learn from past lessons, as it happened with the Database Directive: new rights are here to stay. Other suggested approaches seem more able to fit the needs of the data-economy. In particular, sector-based access against remuneration can be an option to investigate. However, also in this case, this must come together with economic evidence and in dept analysis of possible market failures. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",

"Kurkov K.N., Melnichuk A.V., Duplij E.V., Bondaletova N.F., Bondaletov Y.V.",Electronic personnel documents as a means of protecting employee rights: Challenges and opportunities,2019,"The article raises the acute problem of the transition to remote registration of labor relations and its legislative formalization and consolidation. The main theoretical approaches to this ambiguous process are considered. Despite the sufficient number of works on this issue, the attitude of ordinary employees to such an innovative way of improving the employer's personnel policy has not been identified yet. The results of the study of the role of electronic employment record books in improving the process of managing human resources based on the survey of employees of organizations and enterprises of the Moscow region are presented. On the specific factual material, the proposed article demonstrates the need to digitize the labor relation by introducing an electronic signature. The authors concluded this by processing a representative sample of questionnaires distributed among employees in a predominantly managerial sphere. It is more important than ever to identify an employee’s attitude to innovations, their willingness to accept them and successfully use the offered electronic resources in their own interests under circumstances where the introduction of fundamentally new technologies for labor relations requires reciprocal, concerted actions of an employee, employer and legislator. The data was collected using a closed survey among representatives of the active working population aged under 45. The opinion of the survey participants was revealed through a questionnaire, which included such issues as the benefits and feasibility of digital formalization of labor relations, the attitude of various professional groups to the problems of this formalization, especially the perception of this problem by young Russians. According to the results of the study, fundamental conclusions were formulated on the main issues of introducing digital technologies in the field of formalizing labor relations, and, in particular, digital employment record books as the most familiar means for Russians to assert and consolidate their professional and social status. © 2019, Research Trend.

The cashless system is not just a necessity but also a need of today’s order. Over the past few years, efforts to drive financial inclusion in India have delivered mixed results. Access to bank accounts has increased dramatically, driven by a strong policy and regulatory push. However, the usage of these accounts and the uptake of formal financial services beyond savings accounts has remained exceptionally difficult. The recent initiatives by the Government around demonetization and the move to cashless transactions will further drive innovation and new entrants into the Indust ry. The amendment s to the banking act clearly demonst rate the Government, RBI and Banking institutions intent to ensure stable growth of the economy by ensuring a healthy BFSI. Building Trust within the industry will be paramount to India’s further growth. Newer technologies pose different challenges to the banks and regulators, with security being a key concern. With cyber-frauds on the rise, the regulators and the bankers would have to come together to ensure control mechanisms are in place. A strong push from the Government of India has given the non-banking population easy access to financial products. Payment organizations have demonstrated the advantages of mobile-led solutions and the traditional banking organizations are now trying to make inroads into rural India by launching innovative mobile-based banking solutions.

Under these conditions, innovation policy is an essential element of the development of society and its economy as a whole. Obviously, its successful implementation is possible only on a system basis, through the introduction of innovations in all areas of society development, in the first place - in the production sector. This requires innovative changes not only directly in the production process of enterprises, but also in the field of management, product quality, planning methods, other elements of production. Innovative changes should also cover all stages of the enterprise, including the implementation of the results of activities (products, services) in the market. Companies need new capital investments for innovative changes Real capital investments are a number of investment projects. Projects can be implemented only in full, can be either included in the investment plan, or not. Thus, the enterprise is interested within the limits of the available limit to choose for realization those projects which will provide the greatest increase in sales in the planned period. Thus, the purpose of the research is to develop an optimal investment program which can be represented as an optimization problem. Such a program should include investment projects that provide cumulative growth in sales and profits within resource constraints. The object of study are innovative enterprises.

This article attempts to map the discussions surrounding e-commerce at the World Trade Organization (WTO) and outlines the issues which are the key concerns for India. India's response to negotiations on e-commerce at the WTO has been somewhat reserved. Various Indian policies indicate a preference to cultivate a favourable ecosystem for domestic firms. The Draft E-commerce Policy emphasizes India's domestic aspirations so as to enable the domestic stakeholders to fully benefit from the opportunities that would arise from progressive digitalization of the domestic digital economy. The article assesses the merits of India's position on the contentious issues of e-commerce, namely customs duties on electronic transmission, differential treatment of foreign and domestic firms and restrictions on cross-border flow of data (including data localization requirements). It concludes that while some of the concerns raised by India are justified, India would benefit from devising a coherent and long-term strategy on e-commerce. © 2019 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands.",

As these banks cannot issue loans and credit cards, but both current and savings accounts can be operated by such banks. Money is the life blood of every economy. Now-a-days cash transactions are much simpler due to the popularization of internet, smart phones and other digital technologies. Therefore most of the transactions were cashless and if these practices will continue as it is then in future physical form of currencies will no longer be a king.

This article claims that the increasing importance and time-sensitivity of delivery reconfigures both urban spaces and labour relations. Through an analysis of labour relations in different segments of last mile delivery it argues that we are observing profoUnd changes driven most importantly by digital technologies and the hyper-flexible employment relations facilitated by online platforms. Labour on the last mile is increasingly characterised by intense time pressure, standardisation, algorithmic management and digitally enabled surveillance on the one hand, and platform-driven precarisation and flexibilisation on the other. These developments can also be observed in other areas of logistical labour and across different industries. Hence, labour on the last mile might be Understood as a specific but important expression of a broader tendency of the transformation of labour in digital capitalism. At the same time, the new importance of the last mile also signals changes in the production of urban space in the context of platform-driven forms of production, circulation and consumption, that are discussed as an emerging logistical urbanism. © 2019 Moritz Altenried.",Delivery; Digital Taylorism; Gig economy; Labour; Last mile; Logistics; Platforms; Urban space

The current list of signatories and parties to the MLI and the measures which have been adopted to tax digitalised businesses present a challenge to the multilateral setting. The question of how taxing rights should be allocated must be addressed while also closing the door on tax avoidance. Thus the fate of multilateralism, as will be shown, now rests even more precariously on there being a broad consensus. © 2019 Thomson Reuters and Contributors.",
Puryaev A.S.,The problem of accounting non-economic characteristics when evaluating projects (foreign countries experience),2019,"The present work gives a brief analysis of the methods for recording non-economic externalities (characteristics) when evaluating projects and project efficiency which were identified in the world practice. At first we identified 168 sources by search queries, but after careful study of their annotations, 57 sources were identified, subjected to detailed study on the content of the articles themselves. The analysis revealed groups of non-economic criteria for evaluating projects, a technology for evaluating existing approaches, and a tendency to evaluate projects comprehensively while taking into account non-economic and economic indicators. The concept of integrating indicators into a single normalized dimensionless scale is proposed. It would combine the advantages of existing approaches and methods of world practice in assessing the impact and effectiveness of projects. Thus, the probability of automation increases, shortening the time frame for substantiating and launching projects of a global and national economic level in the age of the digital economy development. © 2019 International Business Information Management Association (IBIMA).",Assessment of efficiency; Impact assessment; Non-economic characteristics; Project appraisal; Sustainability

Sánchez S.N.,The implementation of decentralised ledger technologies for public procurement: Blockchain-based Smart Public Contracts,2019,"In the context of the digital transformation of the European economy and society, new technologies have emerged bringing new opportunities for the benefit of citizens, public administrations and businesses. One of these is the Blockchain-based smart contracts rooted in what is known as Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs). This article aims to provide an overview of how DLTs could be successfully implemented in the governance of public procurement, as well as discussing some legal challenges that might appear. Taking into account the proof of concept of all the existing projects in this field, DLTs promise to provide procuring with a high level of transparency, integrity, autonomy, and overall speed-up procurement cycles. While the architecture of a Blockchain-based public procurement scheme is constrained by the immaturity of the technology, it is observed that the establishment of private ledgers (or public-permissioned ledgers) in tender procedures might be more suitable to public procurement. Although the process of implementation might be costly and less feasible in comparison with other fields in the public sector, initiatives focusing on this area should be endorsed. Ultimately, the successful implementation of DLTs in the governance of public procurement is inconceivable without a far-reaching professionalisation of procurement practitioners. © 2019, Lexxion Verlagsgesellschaft mbH.

Herzfeld M.,Can GILTI + BEAT = GLOBE?,2019,"The OECD is moving forward with consideration of a minimum tax as part of its solution to taxation of the digital economy. Part of a template for such a minimum tax may be the version enacted by the United States (US) in 2017 as an expansion of its Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC) regime, known as Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI). But the OECD version will undoubtedly be different from the US iteration. It's likely that it would also include some aspects of a minimum tax being proposed by other OECD members such as Germany and France, namely a tax on outbound payments, in addition to a CFC-type regime. The United States also enacted an outbound minimum tax in 2017, known as Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT). The two-part minimum tax being pursued by the OECD - a minimum tax based on a CFC regime plus an outbound minimum tax that's a variation on the BEAT - has been referred to as GLOBE (global anti erosion) (See S. Soong Johnston, Germany, France Explore GLOBE Proposal to Tax Digital Economy, 92 Tax Notes Int'l 782 (2018)). This article summarizes the two features of the US 2017 tax reform (known as the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (TCJA) (The formal name is The Act to Provide for Reconciliation Pursuant to Titles II and V of the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2018, Pub. L. No. 115-97.)) that may be incorporated into a global minimum tax, namely GILTI and BEAT, from the perspective of how such provisions might be adapted to work in a global setting. It considers the challenges to taxpayers and policy makers raised by the US law as enacted, and the attempts in recently issued regulatory guidance to address some of these concerns. It compares and contrasts the provisions enacted by the US Congress with a number of parallel European developments, including the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD)'s CFC rules and the German royalty deduction barrier. Adaption of the minimum tax components of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act for worldwide use will require careful understanding of the policy choices, as well as the mistakes made, by the TCJA drafters in designing the regime, in order to ensure that they are not repeated. © 2019 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands.",

The 'arm's length principle' sees itself (for what it is) in the 'digital' mirror,2019,"Under the first pillar, focused on the allocation of taxing rights including nexus issues, several proposals have been made that would allocate more taxing rights to market or user jurisdictions in situations where value is created by a business activity through participation in the user or market jurisdiction that is not recognized in the framework for allocating profits. ... Some of the proposals would require reconsidering the current transfer pricing rules as they relate to non-routine returns, and other proposals would entail modifications potentially going beyond non-routine returns.

The regions were created by the application of cluster analysis. The clustering criterion was the level of digitization measured by the Digital Economy and Society Index. Hierarchical regression models were developed with purpose to investigate the effect of different types of innovative entrepreneurship on economic growth, on panel data for the period 2010-2017. The obtained results confirm differences in contribution of the certain types of entrepreneurship to economic growth in the EU regions, as well as, the influence of digitization on the relationship between entrepreneurship and economic growth. High growth expectation entrepreneurship and new technology development entrepreneurship have greatest contribution to economic growth in the regions characterized by a higher degree of digitization.

The findings indicate that in the process, assets are created on the basis of openly accessible data through certifying of a desired set of qualities to be achieved by adopters and the infrastructure.

Blum D.W.,The proposal for a global minimum tax: Comeback of residence taxation in the digital era?: Comment on can GILTI + BEAT = GLOBE?,2019,"While the political and academic debate on how to address the tax challenges raised by the digitalized economy has been revolving predominantly around extending the right to tax of the source/market state, the most recent proposal - a global minimum tax - chooses a very different path. The idea of a global minimum tax system is to ensure a certain minimum level of taxation through strengthened CFC- and anti-base erosion rules; the underlying policy agenda being that zero or overall low taxation should not only be mitigated by granting more taxing rights to source/market states but by strengthening the residual taxing right of resident states. So far, technical details on how such a system should look like are still missing. Behind this background, the question has been raised in literature whether the US GILTI- and BEAT-rules, introduced in the course of the 2017 US tax reform, could serve as a blueprint for global reform. Taking both GILTI and BEAT as a starting point, this paper tries to develop a tentative tax policy decision tree highlighting crucial conceptual, technical and political issues legislators will have to find solutions for, when implementing such a global minimum tax regime. In doing so, the paper claims that a specific (BEAT-like) outbound regime supplementing the regime's inbound prong (i.e. GILTI-like rules) might be obsolete insofar as both overlap. An unaligned and parallel application of both, inbound and outbound elements, inherently leads to double taxation. From a policy perspective the implementation of a global minimum tax system along the lines of GILTI and BEAT would have two noteworthy side effects: not only would it mean a significant shift to the credit method and hence capital export neutrality, but would - as the name 'minimum tax system' indicates - also potentially mean the end of preferential regime for income from intangibles, e.g. patent boxes; a somewhat ironic effect considering that the third major change to the US international tax rules put into place in 2017, the Foreign Derived Intangible Income (FDII) rules introduced exactly such a preferential system. Moreover, the inherently unilateral nature of the rules such a global minimum tax system would be based upon (i.e. CFC- and anti-base erosion rules) would arguably decrease the relevance of tax treaties and lead to the problem that the existing treaty based mechanism for dispute resolution might become ineffective. Last but not least, implementing a minimum tax regime would require diligent manoeuvering around significant EU law concerns. © 2019 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands.",

Finally, one chapter of the book also documents the resource sector in Western Australia, one of the world's major sources of iron ore. Rapid economic growth over the past decade has significantly changed the gravity of Asia in the world economy. This trend has particularly been strengthened by the awakening giant, China, whose economy has been growing continuously at a two-digital rate since the late 1970's.

Every year the Russian Federation approaches the global standards of qualification assessment. Presidential Decree № 249 of April 16, 2014 established the National Council for professional qualifications under the President of the Russian Federation, which coordinates the work aimed at improving the quality of vocational education, as well as the formation of a system of independent assessment of professional qualifications. The expediency of an objective independent confirmation of a person’s qualifications necessary to perform certain work or solve specific tasks is due to the dynamically changing labor market. The basis of certification is professional standards. Independent assessment of qualifications allows the employee to confirm their qualifications, skills, and competencies, thereby contributing to a higher position, improving their well-being and quality of life. This contribution deals with the European experience of joint activities of business and education in the organization and evaluation of professional competencies of employees, allowing to create optimal conditions for their inclusion in the system of continuing education.

"Trabskaja J., Mets T.",Ecosystem as the source of entrepreneurial opportunities,2019,"The present paper aims to develop an understanding of interconnections between the entrepreneurial ecosystem and entrepreneurial opportunity. The first step of this research was to disclose the development of the ecosystem within two higher (efficiency-and innovation-driven) stages of economic development and the transition between them according to the World Economic Forum, based on the model by Dutch researcher Erik Stam. The Estonian entrepreneurial ecosystem was analyzed as an example. Secondary data on Estonian entrepreneurial ecosystems were collected and analyzed. In its second step, this research follows a case-study design. The start-up period of the studied Estonian companies represents different degrees of the maturity of the ecosystem: Regio and Mobi Solutions – efficiency-driven, GrabCAD – the transition from efficiency to innovation-driven, and Bolt (Taxify) – an innovation-driven economy. The example of the Estonian ICT sector proves that the most important contributors to the talent growth, the knowledge base, and framework conditions of the entrepreneurial ecosystem are the state through its infrastructure decisions and educational programs along with successful entrepreneurs who shape the role models known in Estonia today as the Skype-effect. Decisions on digital telecom infrastructure and e-society in the early stage of the transition in tandem with enterprise encouragement created a subsequent boom in ICT-based ventures in Estonia 10-15 years later. The processes resulted in achieving an innovation-driven society and the highest level of opportunity-driven entrepreneurship in Europe in 2017. With that, new venture funding has replaced the former development engine – foreign direct investment (FDI). Examples of ICT-based new ventures have demonstrated that the growing maturity of the ecosystem increased venture investment from “bootstrapping” to millions of euros of seed-funding and shortened new product development cycles from 5-7 to 1-3 years. The study shows that maturing ecosystems shorten business development processes, thereby increasing the integration of different ecosystems. The start-up success stories enhance trust in the particular business environment, and they both increase investments and accelerate the entry of new ventures, making better use of the emerging windows of opportunities. © 2019 by the authors.

"de Zegher J.F., Iancu D.A., Lee H.L.",Designing contracts and sourcing channels to create shared value,2019,"In complex supply chains, the benefits and costs of technological innovations do not always accrue equitably to all parties; thus, their adoption may critically depend on sourcing relationships and incentives. In a setting with uncertain and endogenous process yield, we study the potential of two features—contract design and sourcing channel—to create mutual benefit in decentralized value chains, where suppliers bear the costs of new technologies while benefits accrue primarily to buyers. Our focus is on agricultural value chains, where parties may transact through a channel that blends farmers’ produce (“commodity-based channel”) or that allows a one-on-one interaction between farmer and processor (“direct-sourcing channel”). Our study provides insights to companies seeking to incorporate responsible sourcing strategies while also creating economic value—a concept called “creating shared value.” We identify that the technology’s “cost elasticity” drives whether switching sourcing channel, changing contract structure, or adopting an integrated change is necessary to create shared value. This highlights that value chain innovations need to be properly designed—and sometimes combined—to achieve sustainable implementation. We also find that certain simple contracts with a linear or bonus structure are optimal, while other intuitive contracts could be detrimental. Using a data set of farms in Patagonia, Argentina, we estimate that the proposed mechanism could increase average supply chain profit by 6.9% while realizing positive environmental benefits. © 2017 INFORMS",Creating shared value; Incentives and contracting; Supply chain management; Sustainable sourcing; Value chain innovations in developing economies

Since the formation of the youth's entrepreneurial potential is linked to the differentiation between the social and economic development of regions, a study concerning the youth initiatives in the field of entrepreneurial activity in certain Russian regions is of great scientific interest. The aim of the current article is to identify the factors contributing to the development of students' entrepreneurial potential in typical regional societies. The choice of the Penza region for this study is dictated by the typicality of this region for the Russian Federation. The key research methods included a mass questionnaire survey, in-depth interviews, correlation analysis, and ranking, which allowed the identification of internal and external factors that promote the development of students' entrepreneurial potential in the Penza region. Furthermore, these methods helped ascertain the contradiction between the high level of general desire of the said region's youth to conduct business activities on the one hand and the relatively low level of creativity in generating business ideas on the other. The results show that Penza's youth has nearly no desire to run businesses in the field of innovation and digital economy, and the most popular areas of business are trade and services. The primary motivation of this region's youth for engaging in business is material well-being, a misinterpreted concept of economic freedom, and the desire to be independent from an employer, which may not be an indicator of the youth's initiative as much as that of their low discipline and weak desire to adapt to the modern Russian labor market. © 2019.",Correlation analysis; Entrepreneurial potential; In-depth interview; Penza region; Questionnaire; Students
"Habanik J., Grencikova A., Krajco K.",The impact of new technology on sustainable development,2019,"The study addresses the aspects of sustainable economic development in terms of Industry 4.0. The fourth industrial revolution is built on digitalization of manufacturing processes, gathering and analysing data across machines and transformation of enterprises into smart and sustainable ones. This manufacturing revolution will bring along significant changes in labour markets. The Slovak economy focuses on industrial production based on cheap labour. In terms of Industry 4.0, the pools of low-skilled workers will no longer be needed. Even today, digital skills and competences are needed for employment. Thus, attention needs to be paid to the need to develop digital skills in order to achieve sustainable economic and social development of countries and regions. The purpose of the paper is to analyse the selected indicators of sustainable development and the effects of Industry 4.0 on their development in the Slovak Republic. The analysis of sustainable development indicators within the framework of Industry 4.0 makes the paper original. The issue has not been treated from this perspective in the Slovak Republic. Thus, new opportunities are opened up to examine social and economic effects of Industry 4.0. Several scientific disciplines tackled the issue from their own perspectives whereas associations of different kinds were not investigated. Basic mathematical and statistical methods (timelines, comparative statistics), analysis of materials, publications, governmental concepts and the EU decisions on the issue have been employed. The data were drawn from the Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic, Ministry of Economy, OECD and EUROSTAT. The authors attempted to identify new opportunities for achieving long-term competitiveness of the Slovak economy and sustainable social development.

"Zveryakov M., Kovalenko V., Sheludko S., Sharah E.",FinTech sector and banking business: Competition or symbiosis?,2019,"Introduction. The rapid development of the digital economy at the national and worldwide levels in recent decades has accelerated processes of transformation of financial systems and led to financialiation of the global economy. FinTech companies operating in the financial market represent a new, quite special category of parabank institutions. They are characterised by the implementation of modern technologies to develop and provide traditional financial services. It would not be possible to provide such services without the Internet and digitalisation, compatibility of electronic devices, including hardware and software, nor would it become possible without new experiences, skills and consumer confidence. This is a kind of analogy with search engines that have changed the architecture of the market and mediation and led to the transformation of business models of financial market entities, in particular banks. Purpose. This paper presents the results of the possibility of providing financial services without banks. It determines the main aspects of competition and directions of combining FinTech and banking. Methods. In evaluation the FinTech and banking sectors, the authors have used statistical monitoring, as well as dynamic, comparative and structural analysis. Results. The results of the study show that FinTech allows creating new services that are not provided by traditional financial intermediaries. It has been proven that the limits for FinTech companies to avoid banking rules and regulations are expanding, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to prove that this is happening beyond the law or outside the law. An analysis of the global trends in the development of the FinTech industry has shown that the volume of investments in this area in 2018 was USD 111.8 billion, which is almost 6 times more than in 2013. The authors examine the main forms of interaction between banks and FinTech companies. Basic models of banks' participation in the creation of FinTech companies are substantiated. The authors of the article have analysed characteristics of the largest FinTech accelerators, identified and characterised the main risks and opportunities relating to FinTech for the banking and consumer sectors. Conclusions. The presented paper reveals the modern trends in FinTech development. They should be taken into account in defining the key determinants of the transformation of the banking sector in relation to the formation of new business models of banks with regard to the challenges of digitalisation. © 2019 Institute of Society Transformation.",Bank; Banking; Financial market; Financial services; FinTech accelerators; FinTech company; Innovative financial technologies

Kamenik L.,The role of data management in resource recycling,2019,"At the current stage of social development, the need for digitalization of waste management manifests itself as an unresolved issue of its own. Its nature, patterns, specific features, and ways of solving this problem need to be thoroughly studied. This attests to the relevance of the presented study, which is aimed at analyzing the role of data management in the field of waste management. Today's global problem - the exhaustibility of natural resources - challenges the society to eschew the traditional resource-based economy in favor of economic development through industrial reproduction. This study shows the fundamentals of economic transformation based on the resource factor and formation of innovative resource potential, establishing data management as a component of such potential and providing a theoretical framework for resource recycle in connection with digital technologies. The study also substantiates that development of digital information systems in resource recycling is a basic prerequisite for its implementation, identifies a number of areas for the application of digital technology, determines the scope of activities and goals for the implementation of digital information systems, and examines the prospects of resource recycling using digital technology as well as the risks of neglecting such technology. As a result, it is concluded that data management in resource recycling is one of the basic prerequisites for its implementation: without organized management of big data, implementation of resource recycling is impossible. © 2019 International Business Information Management Association (IBIMA).",Economic transformation; Innovative resource potential; Perspective component; Resource cycles; Resource recycling
Xu W.W.,Our scholarly ‘pivot to Asia’,2019,"During the Obama administration, America made a shift in its foreign policies to re-focus on Asia. The strategy, known as ‘Pivot to Asia’, was used to contain a rising China. In this editorial note, I appropriate the geopolitical term to call for a scholarly refocus on Asia (and the broader Asia Pacific region). JCEA started as an area journal. While it has become more technology-focused and less geographically-bounded in its coverage of topics, the journal recognizes the centrality of the region’s political economy and technological forces in setting (and upsetting) global norms and rules. The Asia Pacific contains the world’s freest economies as well as the most oppressive regimes. It breeds both technology giants and laggards. As new geopolitical tensions loom, it is where the digital iron curtain is drawn, and where the vice and virtue of innovations debated. Social scientists in the English world, who lend extensively on European and American cases, can benefit from studying the Asia Pacific by testing whether and how local experience conforms to or confronts with universal theories. Very likely, western-centric norms and models become morphed and entangled in the grounded local particularity, reflecting many shades of this diverse place. In my arguments below, I highlight the Asia Pacific as a site of contradiction, as well as a site of contention and negotiation. My emphasis is that regional particularity holds the key to answer concurrent debates in the West concerning governance and accountability in the digital age. © 2019 World Association for Triple helix and Future strategy studies.

Motala M.F.,The G20 - OECD contribution to a new global tax governance,2019,"The 2012 transatlantic corporate tax scandals surrounding Amazon, Google and Starbucks exposed the scope and gravity of offshoring by digital multinationals, producing major dilemmas for the global governance of international fiscal law and policy. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD, 2015] estimates corporate profit shifting erodes up to $240 billion dollars from the global tax base every year. Extant literature has established links between corporate tax avoidance and accelerating domestic socio-economic inequality, the declining redistributive capacity of states, the malign impact on growth of gross domestic product (GDP), and the rise of antiglobalism in the form of populist discontent, providing unambiguous evidence that global tax competition causes social and economic harms. Responding to public outcry, world leaders at the Los Cabos summit in 2012 tasked the OECD with tackling national tax base erosion, and the Inclusive Framework for the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) initiative currently boasts 123 participating states, including 93% of global GDP. Although taxation is at the heart of the social contract, this new global tax governance is both under-theorized and poorly understood in the mainstream political science literature. This study draws on the extra-disciplinary approach of law and economics to argue that while global tax cooperation under Group of 20 (G20) - OECD auspices may be considered a success ex ante based on the record of first-order compliance, the ex post enforcement dimension of BEPS is both under-theorized and under-scrutinized empirically. This study contributes a novel meta-theory of the new global tax governance that accounts for the variables of time, institutional sphere of action and policy feedback loops embedded in the global fiscal policymaking process to stimulate further inquiry. It concludes with recommendations for global fiscal policy, further research on BEPS and G20 digital governance. © 2019, National Research University Higher School of Economics.",Fiscal relations; Global tax governance; International political economy; International taxation

"O'Sullivan M., Sheahan C.",Using innovation games to assess mass customisation potential from the fuzzy front-end,2019,"The buzz surrounding mass customisation technologies like 3D printing and artificial intelligence has many startups hoping to capitalise on this dream of creating personalised products at an affordable price, and well established companies scrambling to innovate and maintain their market share. However, the majority of them are failing as they struggle to answer one key question - where does customisation make sense? It only makes sense where people will pay for it. For products like prosthetics, mass customisation technologies can be highly beneficial. However, for products that already sell without a custom element, customisation is not a necessary feature, and so the product development team must figure out if the customers' perception of the added value of this feature will outweigh its premium price tag. This can be done through the use of a 'serious game,' whereby potential customers are given a limited budget to collaboratively buy and bid on potential features of the product, before it is developed. If the group choose to buy customisation over other features, then the product development team should implement it into their design. If not, the team should prioritise the features on which the customers have spent their budget. The level of customisation purchased can also be translated to an appropriate production method, for example, the most expensive type of customisation would likely be free-form design and could be achieved through digital fabrication, while a lower level could be achieved through short batch production. Twenty-eight teams of final year new product development students tested this methodology when bringing a product from concept through to prototype stage, and found that it allowed them to confidently prioritise their features based on how customers would likely spend their money. Where customers were likely to pay for customisation, the team could decide what level of customisation should be implemented and how it might be produced. A team using this methodology could easily replace mass customisation with another technology or theme that they would like to consider, like the sharing economy or the use of certain materials, to see how it would influence customers' spending. Finally, the results of the methodology can be aligned with the business goals of the company and even integrated into other lean and agile management concepts like the minimum viable product and product roadmaps. © Proceedings of the 14th European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, ECIE 2019.

Based on the methods of mathematical and statistical analysis, it allows you to formalize and convert a large array of data of a qualitative order into a single scale for measuring the process under study - the level of demand in the regional socio-economic environment for block chain technology. The developed methodology is based on the theory of reputational economics, which allows, based on a system analysis of the global information space, to identify the level of demand for the research object in regional markets. Based on the collected and processed array of information and statistical data, the work carried out estimates of the index of reputation capital in the field of block chain technologies in the regions of the Volga Federal District for the period from 2010 to 2018. Based on the presented calculation data, a scientifically-based conclusion was obtained, according to which the regional ""block chain"" processes are beginning to take over the regional space of Russia more and more every year. Moreover, undoubtedly, as well as for any other phenomenon, this process is very differentiated in terms of penetration into the regional environment. In accordance with the estimates obtained, the regions with the highest level of demand for block chain technology and the outsider regions were identified.

The reason is that despite its shortcomings the current monetary system is a product of a long evolution which had adjusted it to the needs of the economy. Cryptocurrencies will probably remain what they have been during the last decade, i.e. the popular speculative assets and the means of payment used - due to their anonymity - for illicit operations. The recent monetary system, based on deposit money issued by commercial banks, will not be replaced also by deposit money issued by central banks (Central Bank Digital Currency) as the CBDC would lack a rational mechanism of its allocation and would pose risks to financial stability. © 2019 Polish Economic Society.

Building on recent literature reviews, this paper argues for the importance of ICT integration in higher education institutions (HEIs) in the developing world and proposes some of the major influencing factors that can help translate ICT integration into reality and serve as a major stimulant for economic development. The paper also reveals how investing in ICT enhances economic performance while focusing on the specific opportunities and the challenges obstructing the acquisition and adoption of ICT by the developing nations. © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Developing countries; Economic growth; Higher education; ICT integration; Influencing dynamics
"Hüser A.-C., Kok C.",Mapping bank securities across euro area sectors: Comparing funding and exposure networks,2019,"We present new evidence on the structure of euro area securities markets using a multilayer network approach. Layers are broken down by key instruments, maturities and securitization. We compare and contrast funding and exposure networks among banks and between banks, nonbanks and the wider economy using a unique data set of banking sector cross-holdings of securities. The analytical approach presented allows the identification of macroprudential risks, since it supports the identification of counterparty risk, concentration risk and funding risk within the interbank network and the wider macrofinancial network. We find that the network layers differ greatly according to topological measures and there is strong heterogeneity in the significance of banks in the different layers. Overall, in all layers, global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) are uniformly active and display an interconnectedness above the mean. Interestingly, we also find that some banks not classified as G-SIBs exhibit similarly high interconnectedness. © 2019 Infopro Digital Risk (IP) Limited.",Interbank networks; Macrofinancial networks; Macroprudential analysis; Market micro-structure; Multilayer networks

Coyle D.,Measuring progress: A review essay on the pricing of progress: Economic indicators and the capitalization of American life by Eli cook,2019,"There is growing interest in the history of economic statistics, and Eli Cook has provided in The Pricing of Progress: Economic Indicators and the Capitalization of American Life a fascinating account of the era of economic measurement prior to the creation of the modern System of National Accounts. The story illustrates the dual character of statistics, which is the product of political contestation and social structures, as well as the data by which we can interpret the economy. Appreciating this duality through the history of economic measurement helps explain why political polarization today often seems to play out as competing interpretations of the “facts.” In this context, the idea that GDP growth is a good measure of economic progress is increasingly being challenged, as both the “beyond GDP” agenda and digital disruption point to a growing wedge between what GDP is measuring and economic welfare. Economists should be engaging with the history of the statistics we use every day in order to be able to shape their future. © 2019 American Economic Association. All rights reserved.",

Daigle J.,Ransomware and its implications: A report,2019,"The practice of demanding a ransom in exchange for the release of a person or an item has been part of the human experience dating at least as far back as Julius Caesar, who was captured by pirates who then demanded a payment of twenty talents for his release (Plutarch). Although Caesar was eventually released, not all ransom demands in history resulted in the safe return of the captured, or even the payment to the captors. With the advent of computers and the digitalization of data and assets, it was inevitable that ransom demands would find their way into the digital landscape in the form of ransomware. A portmanteau of the words ransom and malware, ransomware is a form of malware that, when it has been deployed, will encrypt data on a computer and demand a ransom for the key to unencrypt the data. The purpose of the paper is to explore ransomware and its global implications, not only on local and global economies, but also on industrial firms and what, if anything, can be done to protect ourselves from future attacks. © 2019, Information Institute.

Fan Q.,An exploratory study of cross border E-commerce (CBEC) in China: Opportunities and challenges for small to medium size enterprises (SMEs),2019,"Development of cross border e-commerce (CBEC) is one of the major enablers of SMEs access to overseas market opportunities. The boom in China's cross border e-commerce has been exponential. It has made China the world's largest cross-border market with over 200 million cross-border online consumers. This article explores the opportunities and the challenges for SMEs to leverage the China's CBEC to find and develop new customers in markets outside their domestic ones. It aims to help small to medium enterprises understand the unique Chinese e-commerce ecosystem and develop an appropriate e-commerce strategy that enables them to enter the Chinese e-commerce ecosystem. This research reveals that the significant growth opportunities and challenges for those SMEs poised for business expansion into Chinese market via CBEC and offers a detailed understanding of the China's cross border ecommerce system. SMEs are a major and important part of the world economy in terms of making contribution to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and employment. It is important to help SMEs to understand the significance of cross border e-commerce ecosystem and develop an appropriate e-commerce strategy that enables them to engage with CBEC and empower them to maximize the opportunities offered by CBEC in China. This article recommends that SMEs take a proactive approach to developing effective digital marketing strategies to engage with Chinese online consumers and keep up with new policies, programs and regulatory changes introduced by Chinese governments in a fast changing digital environment. It also suggests that SMEs consider cooperation with an online retailer who is present on China's cross border B2C platforms to yield better results for brand building and direct sale.

Krause I.,Coworking spaces: Windows to the future of work? changes in the organizational model of work and the attitudes of the younger generation,2019,"This paper analyzes how the organization of work has changed since the 1990s including the emergence of digital forms of employment. Following the evolution of work over the course of the 20th century and the start of the 21st, this paper discusses the developments in three periods: the postwar industrialization, the era of automation and digitalization, and, finally, the rise of the virtual economy. Each of these periods correspond with a certain model of production: Fordism, Toyotism, and Uberizm (or Waymoism, named for Google’s Waymo project), which each forms a certain organization model of work (process management, project management, and joint or cooperative action management) and requires different sets of skills. During the discussion of the evolution of work organization, including its geographical and temporal aspects, how attitudes of individuals towards work have changed over time is regarded. Finally, the concept of coworking is analyzed as the cultural foundation for virtual work. Due to the continuing nature of this research, this article presents only the initial results. Therefore citations from one selected – out of 14 conducted – in-depth interviews with managers of co-working spaces are presented to illustrate the first outcomes. © 2019, National Research University, Higher School of Econoimics.

"Kruglyakova V., Meshcheryakova M., Sereda E., Hvostikova V., Titova M.",Challenges and opportunities in breakthrough development in global markets,2019,"Economy digitalization presents new possibilities for the industry, in particular, in processing sectors and a service sector related to them, as well as possibilities for transformation of production processes and business models and for improved economic growth in the medium and long term. Significant progress has been achieved in many developing technologies such as the Internet of things, big data, cloud computing technologies, artificial intelligence, robotic technologies, industrial production based on additive technologies, new materials, augmented reality, nanotechnologies and biotechnologies. Technological developments like that allow for smart manufacturing, customization, co-production and introduction of other new production methods and business models. However, this new environment also causes problems for enterprises, workers, consumers, governments and other parties concerned. Amid the Fourth industrial revolution not only is the list of cross-cutting technologies changing but also the way of thinking and methodological approaches to the development of scenarios of the leap are fundamentally transforming. It is rather obvious that actively restoring industry will become one of the main drivers of the economic growth in Russia in the nearest future.

"Lebedev N.A., Zubkova S.V., Stanik N.A.",The possibilities for cyber management based on cyber-physical systems in the context of the formation of a new model of development,2019,"Purpose: The purpose of the chapter is to examine the possibilities for cyber management based on cyber-physical systems in the context of the formation of a new model of development. Design/methodology/approach: The research is performed with the help of regression analysis. The authors determine the regression dependence of the indicators for the competitiveness of the public (first pillar: Political and regulatory environment) and corporate (second pillar: Business and innovation environment) management of the indicators for the usage of new information and communication technologies in business (seventh pillar: Business usage), government (eighth pillar: Government usage), and the economy as a whole (ninth pillar: Economic impacts). The work is based on data and empirical materials in The Global Information Technology Report 2016, prepared by the World Economic Forum. The research objects are 20 countries, comprising the top 10 (1–10, developed countries) and the second (31–40, developing countries) in the World Digital Competitiveness Ranking for 2018, compiled by the IMD (63 countries in total are rated). Findings: It is substantiated that the possibilities for cyber management based on cyber-physical systems in the context of the formation of a new model of development are substantial. The key directions for automatized state management are monitoring and control, statistical accounting, determining violations of the law, information and consultation support, and provision of state services. The key directions for automatized corporate management are economic accounting and reporting, production management, personnel management, and marketing management. Originality/value: The developed structural and logical scheme of cyber management based on cyber-physical systems shows that such systems could be created at both the micro-and macro-levels using end-to-end (currently actively being developed) digital technologies of Industry 4.0: Internet of Things, AI, and Ubiquitous Computing. This could help to provide the expected advantages and support the announced principles of a new model of development: transparency, accessibility, and full openness of state management, as well as the effectiveness, flexibility, and integration of corporate management. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",
"Mattoo A., Meltzer J.P.",International data flows and privacy: The conflict and its resolution,2019,"The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) widens the scope and strengthens the enforcement of privacy standards. To protect privacy abroad, personal data is allowed out of the EU under strict conditions: if a non-EU country enacts privacy legislation equivalent to the GDPR, or if firms accept Binding Corporate Rules (BCR) or use Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) for specific business deals. These conditions pose a challenge, particularly for developing countries. A GDPR-based national privacy law would impose the same high standard on all firms, even when they sell at home, leading to higher economy-wide costs of doing business. BCRs and SCCs have proved to be costly and time-consuming. While the GDPR may raise WTO issues, litigation cannot address the central challenge: preserving opportunities for digital trade while respecting countries' chosen levels of privacy protection. An alternative approach would involve negotiating agreements under which data destination countries protect the privacy of foreign citizens in return for source countries committing not to restrict data flows, as in the EU-US Privacy Shield and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). In parallel, and as a step toward multilateralizing these agreements, countries would develop common privacy principles, building upon the work in the OECD and APEC. © The Author(s) 2018.

"Cantwell J., Hayashi T.",Paradigm shift in technologies and innovation systems,2019,"This book provides some new ideas on the conceptualization of a shift in technological paradigm, and it explores in depth the relevance of this concept for research on innovation systems. It examines text-mining software and analyzes patent data as well as academic and business journals to illustrate the paradigm shift of newly emerging technologies, such as the all-solid-state battery and automatic driving for electric vehicles, and surgical robots. It also explores the critical role of emerging software technologies by examining US, EU, and Japanese patent statistics. Highlighting the paradigm shift of technologies since the 1990s and the geographical dispersion of innovative capabilities, it identifies essential trends toward new innovation systems as well as the concentration and dispersion of national and corporate R&D capabilities that have taken place as a result. In this new paradigm, the competitiveness of a company is decisively determined by other innovations in systems and management. Since the 1990s, when a network economy began to be established and technological know-how came to be easily transferred across borders, the changing structure of technological activities has required organizations with traditional integral and closed architecture models to move toward open innovation or modular architectures. These changes involve wider technological areas and cognitive diversity among international inter-firm and intra-firm R&D networks. This book is highly recommended not only to academicians but also to business people seeking an in-depth and up-to-date overview of the paradigm shift of technologies and new innovation systems. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.",Convergence and Divergence of R&D Capabilities; Digital Capitalism; Innovation Systems; International Standardization; Paradigm Shift of Technologies; Text-mining

Unsworth R.,Smart contract this! an assessment of the contractual landscape and the herculean challenges it currently presents for “self-executing” contracts,2019,"The widespread use of “self-executing” contracts is now only a question of time. For certain standard contract types with simple and well understood provisions, little international variation, no intermediation and short execution periods, that time is now as the change is already happening (examples are digital rights management and various banking applications.). It is the other more complex, more entrenched, and less agile sectors of the global economy which are the focus of this paper. Here there will be hurdles to overcome and more time needed for implementation—it will be a difficult task. The arrival of this new technology presents important questions about the future of contracting, as well as about traditional legal practice within both legal departments and law firms, calling for a new quality of cooperation between business and their lawyers. Given that the natural reaction to change is resistance, that companies are having ever-greater challenges navigating international regulation and that as a result legal department within companies tend to exert a strong influence out of line with the number of employees they include, the power of institutional resistance to delay adoption of the change will be considerable. This chapter will seek to add a dose of realism to the techno-optimists in the late adolescence of the 21st century for whom the change is so far advanced it is practically finished. In this chapter it is largely assumed that readers understand how Distributed Ledger Technology works, and the principal focus will be on the contractual challenges standing in the way of the implementation of “self-executing contracts,” to which it will also offer some solutions. The original idea contained in this chapter is to embark on a well-planned Digital Contract Optimization journey, supported by new technologies, as a means to manage various risks associated with algorithmically driven processes. This chapter will address the question of the institutional legal mindset as a potential delaying factor and will present a Darwinian argument to explain that change is inevitable and will be radical in terms of the new demands on lawyers. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2019.",Law; Legal practice; Smart contracts; Technology
"Sukumar A., Xu Z., Chen G.",The influences of social media on Chinese start-up stage entrepreneurship,2019,"In today's digital era, information is increasingly shared and distributed through online social networks. Online social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Youtube in the west and Sina Weibo, Wechat in China have not only greatly extended the reach of traditional social networks but also facilitated the information distribution process within the networks. With the rising popularity of such social media platforms, the channel where people obtain information has dramatically compared to traditional print media. Acknowledging the differences in social, culture and economic conditions and the uniqueness of Chinese economy, we argue there is a need to look at the influence of online social networks for Chinese start-up companies specifically. Therefore, in this research, we aim to investigate the influences of online social networks on Chinese young people's perception on entrepreneurship and its impact on entrepreneurial activities for start-up companies. We collected survey data from 100 Chinese participants and carried out 25 interviews. The results revealed current status quo, opportunities and challenges on using online social networks. For instance, Weibo and Wechat are the most popular choices for business activities in China. The main entrepreneurial activities on social networks include information collection and analysis as part of the decision-making process or facilitate the sales and promotion activities. Challenges include such as the overly populated false news and information distributed through the online social networks. © Proceedings of the 14th European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, ECIE 2019.

"Savon D.Y., Aleksakhin A.V., Skryabin O.O., Goodilin A.A.",Occupational health and safety digitalization in the coal industry,2019,"The article discusses problems of occupational health and safety in coal mines. These problems draw great concern both of the government represented by control and supervision agencies and the owners and management of coal mining companies which realize responsibility of business for safety and comfort of miners at work. Any accident inflicts a heavy economic loss to a mine or a business; moreover, it causes irreparable social damage connected with injuries, hurt to health or mortality. The authors believe the hazardous impact of industrial factors on production performance is much higher in mining than in the other industries for the reason that a mineral deposit is concurrently an object of economic activity and a factor of risk. Therefore, mines are assumed as the hazardous production facilities with high probability of emergency. The occupational health and safety control is specific for its functioning indirectly governs efficiency in a number of business activities of a company: production, commerce, economy, social sphere and ecology. The article reviews operation of one of the leading coal mining companies proposing and introducing advanced digital solutions in occupational health and safety. Mining industry raises high safety standards and, thus, uses many innovations, for example, mobile positioning and control of employees in case of emergency, introduction of the United Automated Control Center information and analysis system, etc. Currently, it is undertaken to change ERP system from SAP NANA Platform to SAP Cloud Platform, which will expand the performance range of the system in all structures of the company. © 2019, ""Ore and Metals"" Publishing house.

The openness of information of key public finance authorities has a powerful anti-corruption effect and has a beneficial effect on economic development, while transparency of public finances is a factor in the successful implementation of the reform of all spheres of the economy. The purpose of the article is to develop a methodology for assessing the institutional and political transparency of the leading public finance authorities in Ukraine and its practical application on the example of the Ministry of Finance and the State Fiscal Service of Ukraine. The methodology includes six main stages, based on which the transparency index of public finance authorities was calculated. Constant calculations of the index will motivate the interaction of stakeholders and non-governmental organizations to increase the openness of public finance authorities in public finances, and the digital data settlements themselves can be used to develop recommendations to increase the level of transparency of the activities of key public finance authorities. Approbation of the developed transparency index of public finance authorities on the example of the Ministry of Finance and the State Fiscal Service of Ukraine made it possible to calculate the percentage of openness of data published by the indicated institutions. Based on quantitative calculations, practical recommendations were made for improving the completeness, reliability, availability and timeliness of published information. © Alina Bukhtiarova, Yuliia Dukhno, Ganna Kulish, Iryna Kurochkina, Volodymyr Lypchanskyi, 2019",Information openness; Ministry of Finance of Ukraine; Open data; Public administration; Public finances; Public procurement; State Fiscal Service of Ukraine; Transparency; Transparency index

Discussing the relation between SNS and open innovation,2019,"The millennial generation plays a leading role in today's connected world in which exists a confluence of numerous technologies and the internet in science, economy and innovation. This study aimed to identify the key factors that characterize the millennial generation within the online chatter on Twitter using an innovative approach. To this end, we analyzed the user generated content (UGC) in the social network (SNS) Twitter using a three-steps knowledge-based method for information management. In order to develop this method, we first used latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a state-of-the-art thematic modeling tool that works with Python, to analyze topics in our database. The data were collected by extracting tweets with the hashtag #Millennial, #Millennials and #MillennialGeneration on Twitter (n = 35,401 tweets). Secondly, sentiment analysis with a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was also developed using machine-learning. Applying this method to the LDA results resulted in the categorization of the topics into those that contained negative, positive and neutral sentiments. Thirdly, in order to gather the final results, data text mining techniques were used. The negative factors that characterize the behavior of this generation are depression, loneliness and real-world relationship. The positive factors are body image, self-expression, travelers and digital life and the neutral factors are self-identity and anxiety. Practical implications can be used by public actors, companies or policy makers that are focused on the millennial generation as a target. The study has important theoretical applications as the topics discovered can be used to test quantitative models based on the findings and insights extracted from the UGC sample. © 2019 by the authors.",Data mining; Millennials behavior; Open innovation; SNS; User generated content

"Mansor M., Ibrahim I., Udin N.M., Saad N.",Online businesses tax morale in supply chain relationships,2019,"The number of e-commerce (online) businesses is increasing in Malaysia, providing opportunities for digital business platforms to generate billions of ringgit in revenue. However, the businesses do not pay tax due to the absence of an efficient tax structure for this kind of supply chain management. The government will be looking at ways to tax individuals engaged in e-commerce (online) businesses to address its lost opportunity for revenue from a fast-growing segment of the economy. In addition, clearer guidelines are needed when there is a mixed supply chain operating within a holding company structure when it involves online business transactions. To combat such tax non-compliance by online businesses, it is essential to understand the levels of tax morale of these online businesses. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to unveil the level of tax morale of online businesses and to generate a tax morale framework for online businesses. Using a qualitative research methodology, the result of this study found four major levels of tax morale that are 'input', 'process', 'output' and 'outcome'. The 'input' level consists of tax knowledge, tax obligations and self-awareness. The 'process' level consists of the necessity to follow the business law and tax law, as well as the tax enforcement implemented by the tax authority. The 'output' level consists of the online business owners' trust towards the tax authority and government. Efficient correlation among the 'input', 'process' and 'output' levels of their tax morale will provide an effective 'outcome' in terms of voluntary tax payment to the tax authority that will bring benefit to the community in general. Based on the results obtained regarding the levels of tax morale of the online businesses, this research has developed the tax morale framework for online businesses. © 2019 Exceling Tech Pub.",Business; Morale; Online; Tax; Taxpayers
